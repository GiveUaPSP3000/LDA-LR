1577265,B0017SWAAW,Does not taste like Cheese at all!!!  Not a good alternative.,"I've been a vegan for a really long time.  When I org. purchased this product it was an ok alternative to cheese sauce.  Since, they have changed something and it is no longer the product it once was.  Also, there are a lot more vegan options available now so don't waste your money buy buying bulk.  Try a pack from your local health food store first."
774185,B007GNBPO4,Great list App!,"I have other list apps from this developer and I find them very useful.  For those that have left reviews saying they don't understand why anyone needs an app like this, that's fine and they are entitled to their opinions, but I find electronic lists to be very reliable and helpful. I could use paper and pencil, but then I'd have to recreate the list everytime we were to take a trip. I have previously used an Excel spreadsheet to store my packing lists, but I switched to these type of apps because it is more convenient to carry my tablet around while packing, instead of printing off the excel list.  Since I've started using packing lists in general, I've found that we have reduced the number of times we've had to buy things at our destination because of forgetting some important item. I should also say that I love lists in general, for the sense of accomplishment you get when crossing of an item. This app is customizable, which is very important as well, but is also loaded with premade lists to get you started.If you aren't into lists, don't get this app, and wait patiently until tommorow for a different free app of the day.  Perhaps it will be one you will like, but I won't care for it. That's fine. I don't know why people think that every free app of the day should appeal to them. That's not realistic. Don't be a hater and rate an app low just because it isn't useful to you. Rate it on it's own merits."

359962,B002E9HZXU,It broke,"This is one of the millions of vibrators I have bought in the last few years that has broken on me fairly quickly.  I hate when that happens especially when you are in the middle of about to you know ""be done"" and it stops on ya.  It's like omg! dang! LOL.. so yea..."
1735617,B000MF6U7U,Listen to bad reviews,"I did not by this from amazon but from a local box star, but it is such a POS that I felt compelled to add to the bad reviews.This product will corrode will no longer swivel in less then 2 years.  Additonally the buttons that switch the spray mode fall off.The plastic internal base on mine eventually fatigued from the stress of moving the bound up faucet and cracked.I just put back my 20+ year old delta till I can find a new faucet."
3742216,B0002H335A,Wrong item shipped after ordering NEXT DAY,"I ordered and paid for next day air because I needed it this weekend.  It arrived, but it wasn't what I ordered.  I ordered a pair of jack stands.  I received an engine hoist leveler.I understand mistakes happen.. but it was the way the return has been handled that I have issues with.  UPS dropped it off, but I have to take it to the post office to send it back?  And I wasn't told if they'll wait to ship the right order until they receive this back via the slowest mail service.. so I have no idea when the replacement order will arrive.  A week?  Two weeks?This wasn't my mistake or even a defective product.. this was human error on their part.  They should have told me they'd IMMEDIATELY ship the replacements next day like I ordered.  So far I'm left hanging.  Should I go out locally and get what I need and then end up with an extra set?  Should I hold off a day because they're coming next day?  I don't know.. and that's the point and that's why I gave them one star."
1456283,B003CF4Y7A,"Great idea, but...","This is a great idea. Too bad it doesn't really pan out all that well. I honestly don't know when the PC collector's series was released; Amazon's telling me that it first showed up here in 2010, and IGN is saying that it showed up on the PS2 in late '06. But given that it is here, being sold, and I got my copy new, I am inclined to judge it by 2010 standards.So, on Windows 7, NFS Underground 2 is a nightmare to get running consistently. Most Wanted runs fine, and as another reviewer has already pointed out, Most Wanted and Underground [1] cannot be installed simultaneously. I figured a little technical know-how and browsing the Underground CD for a setup executable manually would work -- no, it doesn't. Even the setup (not autorun) redirects to an Underground launch screen with the option being ""Play"", not ""Install"". I just got Most Wanted up and running in widescreen format (you can use a tool called UniWS set for modifying NFS Underground 2 with a few tweaks, Google it, to get any custom resolution working. It doesn't look too sharp, but it's better than having half your screen real estate wasted with black bars and the aspect ratio works) and I don't want to undo that. So Underground 1 may or may not work very well, but 2 doesn't, and Most Wanted is fine, but the fact that they can't be installed alongside should have been rectified somehow. I realize that would involve patching some stuff, and I imagine that would be a nightmare, but this would be bad enough to discover if you had them from separate sources, but come on, selling them together? Lame.For Underground 2, you can scratch your head 'til your hair falls out and you may get it running, but it's a race against the clock until you're desperately frustrated. What happens is this: it freezes during loading (and by that I mean it just seems to load forever, or I guess possibly longer than 20 minutes). You have to minimize and Task Manager-forcequit it and try again. What makes this most frustrating is that there is no perceivable pattern. None whatsoever. There are things you can do to decrease the likelihood of crashes, and I will list them below, but on Win7, this still gets it down to around a 10% loadscreen-to-crash ratio, and given that every event involves a loadscreen, both beginning and end... yeah. Very frustrating.Should you wish to try on Win7, here is the list of things that I found to each decrease likelihood of load hangups:- Stop using an analog controller (this is a big one, it helped a bunch)- Delete or rename the MOVIES folder inside the NFSU2 install dir- Set SPEED2.exe to run in Compatibility mode for WinXP SP2- Set SPEED2.exe to disable visual themes- Run SPEED2.exe as administrator (there is a toggle for this on the Compatibility tab)- Set SPEED2.exe to only use CPU core 0 (Task Manager > SPEED2.exe > right-click > ""Affinity"" > uncheck all but 'CPU 0'I'm a patient guy. And I freaking love U2. Honestly, this was too much for me.Also, the ""DVD"" tag here is misleading; both Underground 1 and 2 come on two (2) CDs and Most Wanted comes on a DVD. Dumb. Especially considering the packaging; one CD gets put in the DVD box and the other is put in a sleeve behind the instruction manual. Wat. For random further reference, these are the UK editions of the games.I'm inclined to gripe that it doesn't include Carbon, because for all intents and purposes it fits right into this vein of racing game history - heck, it even used the same engine. I bought that separately though.Bottom line? I recommend buying justMost Wanted. It was awesome, and runs fairly well (although I would wish the framerates would stay at 60+ consistently these days, there is a very slight sinewave of framerates that ends up going on on modern cards, see for yourself -- not a big deal but kinda wonky). For the other 2, find 'em for the Xbox or PS2. They play better over there. 2 stars, under the assumption that this was released in 2010. Tsk tsk."
269882,B000P7M26I,It's Scented!,The product I received is vanilla-orange scented! This is not indicated anywhere. I don't have the time for a return so I guess I'm stuck smelling like a creamcicle! Sucks!
3752345,B001DKM3SI,not sturdy,The problem with this wash mop is that the head falls off the handle quite easily. If you try to shake it off to get some rinse water out the whole head pops right off. Obviously this is very annoying. And this problem occurred from day 1 it is not that the thing was abused over time.
3759691,B006R0XYGY,great buy,"Arrived quickly and as described. These work pretty well, and are pretty bright. I tried a 6-led version before this which were alright, but these are brighter. They fit well, but it would be nice if they had the polarity indicated.  Had for several months now and they work great.  They are a little on the blue side, but not as much as some of the other LEDs I've tried."
531977,B00HGY9TGO,Excellent immune system booster!,"I have been researching the benefits of Turmeric for quite a while and for a few years I really tried to get more of this spice into our daily diet, but it is really tough to eat enough of it to reap all of the health benefits that Turmeric has to offer, detoxification, improved skin, reduced inflammation, strengthened immune system... and so much more!  This supplement is a daily part of our routine and we love it."

3749894,B000OQMHEC,Terrible,All it does is scrape and pit your battery terminals - I really don't see the point of getting this tool. Scotch-Brite sponge would work better to clean the battery terminals.

3755134,B002MQCY7C,Works great on all my helmets.,"I have this clip on all of my family's helmets.  Two for my Harley, one for my 4 wheeler, and one for my 7 year old.  It fits well, holds well, and way more convenient then the loop strap."
3638444,B000OSIJ10,Not worth the money.,"Every time I buy one of these things for our cats, they always decide that our couch or our wall is better to utilize for scratching.  I will never buy a scratching post ever again.  Actually, we just adopted older cats that were already declawed.  THAT IS HOW I PLAN TO DO IT FROM NOW ON.  Adopt cats that are already declawed.  I noticed that any/all cats listed as declawed were adopted very, very quickly.  Others must also understand."
3691677,B003Q6AG9K,Low Quality,So loud it is probably getting returned.  The cats are more interested in the grinding plastic sound.Also the slowest speed is not slow enough.
266739,B000NP79YM,Soft enough to sleep in,I needed an item to be able to sleep with as my wife likes to sleep with noise.  This item worked perfectly and I even use them for other activities like riding my motorcycle.
3381764,B005NFJAWG,Exceedingly bad quality disks,"The disk quality is very bad. Most of the disks have flaws. Unfortunately, I did not play them immediately after receiving them; so, I missed the return window. I could not in good conscious donate them as someone else would end up paying for junk. I threw the set into the garbage."
3755298,B002OUMVWY,Wish I could say I love it but it IS A SEWER HOSE...,"Much better than the hose that came with the camper. More than I expected for the price! If you need one, this is a good one!!!"

1308400,B0000296O5,The Next Chapter In The Final Fantasy Saga Is Here!!!,"When people play a Final Fantasy game they expect several things to come out of the finished game!  For one thing a great story, great charicters, cool battle system, drama, comedy, and greatness, cool graphics, and overall a great game!  That said and done Final Fantasy VIII is the worst example of how to make a great RPG!  When a great RPG company like Squaresoft, who been making the best RPG's for years now, comes in and makes a game, people expect it to be great!!!  Esspecally if it's a Final Fantasy game!  Well let me tell you that Final Fantasy VIII is anyting BUT a great RPG!!!  In fact this game is so pooryly thought out I am at a loss of words!  I'm sure you've already herd complaints about the complicated battle system, cumcumber (And glitched) plot, and lack of charicter developement!  So I'll spare you the details for once!  Lets just say Final Fantasy VIII not only gives the Final Fantasy series a bad name, but it also gives RPG's as a whole a bad name!  Thank you.  Have a nice day!"
2734051,B0002W4SX6,Classic,"Heart warming, good, clean fun, with iconic actors as the regular cast and as visitors of single episodes. Cozy, timeless."
1425710,B001TOMQVC,Not Just Another Rail Shooter,"Dead Space: Extraction is an on-rails shooter that functions as a prequel story to the acclaimed PS3/360 shooterDead Space. When an outbreak spreads across Aegis VII that turns the population of the colony into bloodthirsty Necromorphs, you lead a band of survivors to safety on the starship Ishimura. Only, it turns out the Ishimura is experiencing an outbreak of its own.The Wii has played host to a rail-shooter revival, and gamers interested in that old school, arcade experience have several fine options to choose from, includingHouse of the Dead: OverkillandResident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles. Dead Space: Extraction is another strong addition to the list, offering up several key design changes that keep the formula from getting stale.The first notable difference is that the game places a heavy emphasis on narrative. You don't simply load up the levels and start shooting - you'll converse with the characters from a first-person perspective, figure out what needs to be done and move out towards your objectives. Enemies will attack in bursts (much like your typical survival horror game), and then you'll get a bit more narrative, sneak around more corridors and sewers, fight some more, and repeat. Developer Visceral Games has opted to create a slow-burning, immersive experience over the loud, relentless hammering of its genre counterparts. So you won't always be poised with your finger on the trigger, but you'll get to know your fellow survivors and feel like you're part of their world. The story tosses a few twists at you, including switching up perspectives (surprisingly, not everyone you play as makes it out alive). In all, the story elements expand each level's playtime significantly, so be prepared to drop upwards of half an hour on certain segments of the game.The action in Dead Space: Extraction builds gradually - Necromorphs will come at you in manageable waves early on, but by the end of the game you'll be swarmed by a variety of foes at different speeds, some lobbing projectiles, some flying overhead. Your ammo, with the exception of your default weapon, is limited to what you pick up, so you'll need to pick your shots carefully as you dismember your opponents limb by limb (popping a Necromorph's head only encourages them to swing at you recklessly). I like the challenge, but some sections almost border on unfair with the projectile-shooting enemies obscuring themselves at the far end of a level while a bloated Necromorph explodes to unleash little starfish which you have to shake off with your wiimote (possibly the most annoying enemy in the game). For such a story driven game, a few moments stretch credibility as your player stands and fights while a retreat would be more appropriate. To help you in disposing of enemies, you'll have access to a stasis beam which lets you freeze enemies, and collectable upgrades add to your overall firepower. Other touches Dead Space: Extraction adds are more interaction with the environment. You'll be opening doors, soldering connections together to override computers in a pointer-based mini game, grabbing and launching objects with a kinesis beam and riveting objects together (often to barricade yourself against approaching enemies).Where does the game fail? Even with it's lengthy levels, the overall experience is a tad short. There are only 10 missions, with the last one feeling slightly anti-climactic by the lack of a true boss monster. You'll open up challenge levels for score rankings, but otherwise you won't find extra story missions or the breadth of goodies the Resident Evil and House of the Dead games have offered (an unlockable motion comic is a nice bonus, but isn't terribly compelling to sit through). Worst of all, the game seems prone to bugs and crashes. In one section my character refused to move on after clearing a hallway of enemies, and in the last level the game crashed during the final cutscene (forcing me to start over).Unfortunate glitches aside, Dead Space: Extraction still remains a top-notch game for the console. With so many shooters opting for ""quick time events"" and placing players on linear paths to create a ""cinematic experience"", it seems the genre is sliding towards rail-shooters anyway. Dead Space: Extraction finds a great balance where a lack of free movement doesn't equate to a dumbed-down experience."

1703443,B00009LI4K,Peltor H10A earmuffs,I am well pleased with the ear muffs. They appear to be well made . I have used them often and like the way they block loud sounds but I am still able to hear if someone speaks to me.
3750675,B000WJ64O0,Does not fit 2012,"I see that no one has left a review in a while, so they no one may  have ordered for a 2012.I ordered this for my 2012 JK and it does not fit. The circumference for the steering wheel was right but I assume the ""thickness"" of the steerng wheel has changed as this does not cover the steering wheel correctly (front to back) and I had to remove and return..."
1734560,B000LNODSQ,Horrible!!!!!,"It was absolutely impossible to peel one or two cords long enough before it broke.  It was very difficult to work with, but I thought I'd try.  So I wound up piecing the broken cords together and put them around my window.  Within a week the window was damp, from condensation, (which is what I was trying to avoid by using the cord) and the ""caulking"" began to fall off, as it was no longer ""sticky"".I took it all off and threw it away.  Next Fall I'll be purchasing something else to go around my window."
1840177,B000002OF7,so/so,"despite the importance of this group think r.kelly.jodeci,mary j bliege,dru hill,etc.. this album is not on par with the first disc.teddy is a great producer but a bad vocalist.he nearly ruined long gone.Aaron hall  sounded strong.he hasn't had anything that has matched his guy days but his  influence has continued.the grooves slipped on this disc.but the slow jams  held up such as lets chill.hopefully the new one will get it right.however  this disc is still better than blackstreets last one by a 100%."

1529940,B00DE2W5XG,Two faulty units in a row.,"Currently awaiting my second replacement PS4 from amazon, with my original and first replacement being faulty. I have lost faith in Sony, as going through 3 PS4s in 2 weeks is shameful on their part. The quality of these systems and the quality control going into them seems like a far cry from systems of the past, and it's very disappointing and discouraging with what consumers like myself are going through.I'd advise anyone wanting a PS4 to wait it out for some months until Sony can iron out these problems. Even though I love video games, I don't think any product is worth this much trouble."

397177,B003LJAFY8,Addictive,"I found this on sale at a local health food store -- wow. It's delicious! I like that it's peanut-free and that the jar is upside down for easier stirring. Yes, it is expensive and so are organic nuts so I'm not too shocked now that I understand the ingredients.I'm very happy to have found this yummy product."
1647745,B00535HCI0,the ones I got were stale,"Usually I get these from Wallgreens where they come in smaller packages and are very well sealed and very fresh.  The product gets a four star vote because of that minus the one for the freshness.I recently purchased these again from the drug store and I have lowered my rating for this item accordingly.  The freshness is very important.  From the drug store they get a 5 star, so it is not the product but the seller that matters."

1792387,B004U4S7UC,Handy for the saw,I bought this with a power miter saw and didn't want to fight using the saw and try to utilize a table top. Stand works well with saw. I don't know why I thought it had extensions on the ends for long lumber. I may have just got different items mixed up when I was shopping around.
1588520,B001EQ55RW,"Sorry, I didn't agree with y'all","These fell short on flavor, sweetness, and satisfaction. As other reviewers have mentioned, they do have a bit of an after taste too.  Trader Joe's are way better and at a much better price.For those that absolutely want less calories and low sugar they would get you by, but for me, I'd rather have a little less of something really good."
1335393,B00006FWTX,This feeds some sort of inner need...,"Maybe it's my genetic disposition towards knick-knacks, or maybe it's my affection towards open-ended game structures, but whatever it is, Animal Crossing has hit me hard.This game provides a large amount of innovation, both in game design and game philosophy.The game is set around a Sims-like goal: do what you like. You live in a small town, with an ever evolving collection of surprisingly sassy villagers, and you decorate your house, go fishing, or fossil hunting, do some weeding, write letters, etc.The games two main focal points are things and relationships. And it's extremely addicting.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the game technically is it's 24 hours-a-day game cycle. The game itself runs on an actual calendar and clock. Need to sell some fish? Too bad, it's midnight, and the local store is closed. Is it 5 o'clock? Maybe you can go chat it up with the mailman. The seasons change, and holidays, both made up and actual, occurr, as well as random events that can pass you by, if you are not careful.Everything about this game is designed to pull you in for just 10 more minutes, ala Diablo, minus the killing part. Picture Diablo, but just the stuff part, and Deckard Cain as actually being worth talking to."

3756006,B00353PWAW,"Good, but not a replacement for real waxing.","I've been using Meguiar's Wash and Wax on my Corvette for years, and it's a good wash for cars. It produces a lot of suds without using a whole lot. In fact, I find that less is better than more. If you use too much, it can leave a slight film on your car from the wax which is especially noticeable on dark vehicles. If it happens though, it is easily removed by wiping with a good polishing cloth. Meguiar's Wash and Wax is also not really a good substitute for an occasional real waxing. It is good to extend the period of time in between waxings.""Meguiar's Wash and Wax"" cleans well, and its hybrid blend of waxes offers a little bit of extra protection. As long as you don't use too much, and don't substitute it for an occasional real wax job, I recommend it."
3748987,B000IE0YIQ,Terrible design,"I was looking for a small air compressor to fill basketballs, bike tires, car tires, etc.  This compressor works fine but it has to be one of the worst designed products I've purchased in recent memory.  The power cord is about 12"" long, as is the air tube.  Who thought that was a good idea?  Meanwhile, there's about 50' long cable for the 12V adapter.  This actually makes more sense but since I'm not using the 12V it just gets in the way.  Of course, you can store the 12V cable in a nice little storage space in the unit...except that's where they decided the put the power switch!  Are you kidding me?  The power switch is located deep inside some hole in the back of the unit?  Are the designers insane?  I'm stuck with this thing but you might want to look elsewhere."

2991962,B000VZADR4,ho hum biopic,"**1/2In 1963, Hector Perez was already a promising young singer in his native Puerto Rico when, at the age of seventeen, he moved to New York City to try and make a name for himself as a performer there.  In no time flat, he was playing in clubs, had signed a lucrative recording contract with the Latin-flavored Fania Records, and had changed his name to the far more exotic-sounding Hector Lavoe.  From the mid-1960s to his death from AIDS in 1993, Lavoe was an international sensation who helped to popularize the musical style known as ""Salsa.""  But, as with most artists, he lived a life of self-destructive self-indulgence, marked by serial philandering and hardcore drug abuse.  He also had a volatile relationship with ""Puchi,"" the Bronx girl who became his wife and who narrates ""El Cantante,"" the glossy movie about his life.Despite the novelty of the milieu and an undeniable sincerity on the part of everyone involved in its production, ""El Cantante"" remains doggedly conventional, lackluster and superficial in its treatment of the kind of material with which we are all too familiar from previous biopics that have chronicled the rise and fall of artists of all categories and stripes.  Marc Antony brings a certain ferocity and depth to his portrayal of the struggling celebrity, but real-life wife Jennifer Lopez is all fluttery overacting as the woman who stood by her man through good times and bad (mostly bad).  The music is enjoyable, but I'm afraid we've all been down this road so many times before that ""El Cantante"" fails to stir either our passions or our sympathy for the sadly benighted couple and all that they're going through.  You'd be better off buying the albums instead."

2888057,B000GCFO08,"Zzzzzz... *snort* what, what, is it over yet?","In horror movies, there are several different rating factors.  Sadly, the only one this rated highly in is the one you don't want to: the cheese factor.  Mediocre acting, boring and unrealistic special effects, some hard-to-hear (perhaps mercifully) dialogue and over-the-top 'mood music' are enough to render this movie nearly unwatchable.  Plus the overall darkness of most of the scenes (a trend in horror movies these days, I suspect to cut back on special effects budgets) means that even if you watch the movie in the dark you're still squinting at the screen.I found it sadly lacking in plot (okay, it had one, but not a good one - it was trite and recycled) and with almost no suspense to speak of.  I didn't care what happened to the characters.  At one point I was willing to off the main character myself if it'd just stop her shouting.  Of course, this could be because the sound swung wildly from barely audible to bursting your eardrums.  It had a few moments that might have made you jump, were I not overwhelmed with apathy (for instance, the scene with the nurse corpses would have been jumpy, except I spent the time thinking how much it would have improved the movie if they'd busted out into the Thriller song and dance).  It had no lasting, nightmare-giving spook effect (though I admit to being a hard-core horror movie veteran, it would take a lot).I was even willing to give it credit in that it lacked the gratuitous gore that movie-makers now think is a good substitute for real horror, but then the end of the movie was showers of blood and unnecessary gore, which added nothing and took away any brownie points it may have earned in that arena.The only redeeming factor in the entire movie was the very end.  I'll give it a little credit there for not taking the easy route and leaving you with a little lingering air of mystery.  But that wasn't enough to even come close to tipping the scales against the mountain of badness that had accumulated.  Bottom line, on a scale of one to five popcorn bags this movie rates a fossilized chunk of popcorn you find under your couch."
3751091,B0012WHBSO,Good Product,More than enough to fill out truck and car tires.  I don't think the gauge is very accurate; I always use a second gauge to get an accurate reading.
3759741,B006R34PB4,The trunk is no longer a dark and scary place.,"Trunk and cargo area lights seem to be an afterthought, almost as if car-makers are saying ""Throw a low-wattage fixture back there and we'll have one more 'standard feature' to pad the list in the brochure.""  That all changes when you plug in these li'l chunks of the Sun. Because of their extra length, they're particularly suited to horizontal installation as in dome, trunk and cargo lights.  If you can plug them in and they fit the enclosure, they're perfect for many cars made within the past 10 years and beyond like the trunk light in our 2004 Honda Civic sedan and the cargo light in our 2013 Subaru Impreza hatchback.  The pure white light complements the LED dome and map light bulbs we installed, spreading that white-hot LED bling into the dark forgotten regions."
1830238,B0000025YM,ANOTHER SELL OUT,"There's no shame in PRIEST releasing this album. If their only option was to sell out, use puffy hair and thing like that, they even managed to release a stisfactory pop-metal album. I must remember you that this was not a &quot;phenomenom&quot; that occured only with the mighty Priest, during the middle eighties: it also happened with SAXON, SCORPIONS, MICHAEL SCHENKER, RAVEN, ACCEPT, and other greta European bands, who tried hard to &quot;make America&quot;. In Judas case, they had already &quot;made America&quot; with their previous albuns, but probably greedy executive men made up their minds about selling out and making even more money. So, in DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH we have the first clear signs of what we should have to endure with the release of the &quot;great&quot; TURBO.."

1380919,B000JHO4L0,One of the best,"I purchased this unit when it first came out. I wasn't disappointed with it. The HD DVDs look fantastic. It has crystal clear sound with a beautiful picture. The added HD DVD King Kong is a nice plus along with the remote. This unit installed in seconds. I am not to sure about the whole up-converting regular DVDs. The regular DVDs look the same (yes I have the VGA wire). This is a nice add on for anyone who owns a HD TV and an Xbox 360. I love the fact that a lot of HD DVD come with DVD format. So if you buy an HD DVD and your friend doesn't have an HD player, you can use the regular DVD player to watch the movie. This is a great value. If you have any questions about this unit you can leave a comment and I'll reply as soon as I can."

It tugs and sticks. Also, the included wipes are useless. They are like wax paper with oil on them. I tried to use one, and it was even more of a mess than the wax was. I will go back to using the Sally Hansen brand."
1297600,B000960KNW,Horrible Design - Friction backs out mounting screws,"Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us."

1840585,B000002OQ6,Pretty good,"This is a good album from Elton and friends. Most of the songs are not Elton/Bernie compositions though, but that doesn't really matter. While most of the songs and performances are good, there are a couple of weak parts. On &quot;Teardrops&quot; k.d.lang sounds more like a background singer than a duet partner. And I could do without the RuPaul track, but otherwise its an ok album. Most fans of Elton's, I'm sure, would want this album in their collection."
3659033,B001CQTOMG,"Sturdy, pup likes it","For some reason, my pup immediately loved this. On the first day I brought her home, she found it on the other side of the living room and jumped right on it. She also runs back to it during games of fetch. I'm not sure if it truly &#34;cools&#34; or &#34;warms&#34; her depending on the side, but it has a nice degree of &#34;stuffing&#34; to it which gives it about 2 inches of height. We've done some &#34;mat&#34; training with it. She also likes to rearrange her pen with it so it's light enough for a dog to &#34;make her bed&#34; and move it around. Pup started trying to rip into the light colored side of it at one point - she gave up after getting some small tufts off of it but the product looks the same and was apparently boring enough in this respect (in a good way) that pup wasn't tempted to try to rip it to shreds more than that one time."

1300889,B0027V760M,Noisy POS,"Ok, I'm surprised that this unit is now over $15.00.  I only spent $8.59 for this and I'm mad at myself.  It was cheap enough that I rolled the dice to see if I could get away with a decent product for CHEAP.  It feels solid, looks like a real direct box...but sounds like ass.  I couldn't believe that Pyle would put that much effort into a great ""fit and finish"" product, yet not put decent components inside.  This is the noisiest piece of crap I've ever used - I ended up buying another direct box (spent over $60.00).  Pyle has once again lived up to it's name, but they should finish the name properly and re-brand as ""Pyle of S***.""Sorry folks, but I'd skip this one.  The 5-star ratings must be from employees.  The only reason I didnt' give it one star was because it was so cheap (Remember, I only spent $8.59), and I'm the one that pulled the trigger on the purchase.Live and learn.  Why would I think plugging a $2000.00 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea?  My fault."

I didn't think I really needed the adapter since I tend to use Dropbox a lot and Skydrive, however I use this more than I thought and it is so easy to access files. When I received the package, the Samsung box was smashed a little because it was in a padded envelope, which did not hurt the adapter, but maybe the seller should rethink packaging. Great purchase, I recommend this adapter."

1334793,B00006C2HA,"A lot like the original Half-Life, only better gfx and slow:","Having a DSL connection of 1.5/1.0M, I wasw shocked to see how slowly online play was (avoid games with more than 4 players on even this high connection.) - especially when compared with Unreal Tournament 2004 (which can EASILY handle 8 players.)But the main solo play game is a lot like Half-Life; even some of the sound effects are the same!  It's the same old follow-the-path structure and apart from a few unsuspected scares (don't have a weak heart when playing this one), has no replay value except for multiplayer - which I'd recommend, MINIMUM, a 1.5/1.0 DSL connection.  Doom3 hogs internet bandwidth even more than UT2k4, et al.Id could take a lesson from Atari about how to better use bandwidth.  UT2k4 is exceptional by comparison and is surprisingly playable on 256k down/up speeds.Overall, it's a good game, but don't pay more than $18 for the original and $15 for the Ressurection add-on pak (so wait a few months).  Anything more is exploitation of an uncreative product that should be faster with online play.  (All the players and texture/bump maps are on each PC, what exactly are they sending over the internet that's dragging things down?!)Looks very nice and is playable even on my lowly hardware (see below), but it adds nothing to the genre (it even goes backwards; the flashlight has an infinite power source, good grief).My system:Abit NF7 mobo (nforce2 chipset, dual DDL).Athlon XP 2100+ @ 2700+ C{U1GB RAM (2x512 modules)Nvidia geforce 5900fx video (128MB RAM) from BFGSB AudigyAgain, for solo play it'll run great at 1024x768, ultra quality.

It took him a minute, but he, too, enjoyed it. The rest of the herd came flying into the kitchen, even the deafie!!

Over the years, I've tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel, the Martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus."

It was a catchy and damn fun to listen to. Now 13 years later, a no-talent named Katy Perry releases a damn song with the same song, just less catchy and a scheme to get attention.

1879727,B002DSM8UC,The Imperfect Angel With An Imperfect Album,"Now to me there are no ironies lost on this album title. To me it's not only surprising because I wasn't expecting to be in the possition to give this album a rare (for me) two star review. Considering the high quality and more ambitious creativity-building that Mariah Carey had done on the albumsCharmbraceletup throughE=MC2this album is not at all in the same league. Mariah actually had a pretty ambitious lyrical concept working for her here too dealing with the in's and out's of love as one matures. The problems with this album come from the music. Leaving the musical diversity behind Mariah comes off here as just playing up the whole enchilida of modern R&B; diva clishes. It's all here from the liner notes presented like her own personel page in a magazine to the wet tee shirt photography. It's another example of Mariah making something of a fool of herself in order to reach the charts as she leaves what the music world considers ""her youth"" behind. The most glaring problem of this album however is definately the music. From the faster to the slower the songs on this album all come from the same basic idea. The rhythmic pattern never changes and production handled by Tricky Stewart and ""The Dream"" only substitutes a lot of gloss for any sense of rhythmic variation. Even by todays standards the instrumentation is extremely fake sounding too. It doesn't help that the lyrics or juevenile and repetitive to the n'th degree too considering the great concept as intended. Actually there are only two songs here that show much promise at all. One of them is the pretty well arranged ""The Impossible"" and the other is a pretty well done (if close to the original) cover of Foreigners hit ""I Want To Know What Love Is"". Unlike a lot of reviewers I actually enjoy Mariah singing in a funkier style with her lower voice here. If only the execution of this album lived up in any way to it's concept."
1863316,B00008OM62,uh . . . no,"There was something a bit corny and cheesy about caia that just didn't appeal to me.  There's a warm, all engulfing fuzzy feel to this disc but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  It seemed a bit too over produced and the music came across as murky and muddled.  I tried selling my copy at three different used music stores and no one wanted to buy it. If you like your downtempo a bit cheesy and forgetable, the magic dragon is for you. Not a single track reached out and grabbed me and the disc kind flowed in such a manner that eventually every track started to sound a like. I was finally able to unload my copy.  Not a bad disc but there is SO much better out there."
1525408,B00CMC6HCY,Not quite immortal,"I was excited to play this game the moment it was revealed that the Ultimate Warrior would be a playable character (pre-order bonus only for now) and all the commercials hyped up the game to be the best game in the WWE Universe and lo and behold...........its an EPIC FAIL.The developers need to realize that once a player buys the game, they should enjoy it and not become frustrated, after all, this is not an arcade game rigged to drain our quarters, it is a console that people pay FULL PRICE to enjoy. I have no problem progressing through the Wrestlemania era to unlock new characters and items but everybody who had mentioned about the AI being super difficult even when the settings are adjusted are correct.A good example is Wrestlemania XII Iron man match with Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart, you can beat up the Hitman and dominate the match and the game automatically triggers "" Wrestlemania moments"" to mimic the actual match, fine but once the cut scene completes, there you are on the mat with no health and the AI can totally hit all their moves, rack up tons of signatures and finishers and deny you the chance to even finish the match, I tried this with the default settings and adjusted settings (I tried to make it easy)and still it is frustrating.I think another thing to make this game better would to allow players to pick and choose which match or era they wanted to instead of being forced to drudge along the entire campaign, come on, this is WWE not a well thought out game like Mass Effect or something.The roster is fine, you will have multiple versions of some superstars (Cena, Triple H, Big Show for a few) but no Trish Stratus, not even as a DLC character, she was the only thing to make this good. So sorry Divas fans, you get another lack luster roster with no Diva legends.Otherwise, this game is okay, if you are patient enough, the Wrestlemania mode brings back a lot of memories, the Undertaker's streak mode is also interesting yet frustrating if you are going for the trophy, all in all, it is a good entry into the WWE series but it has lots of room for improvement.My advice, wait for it to go down in price, that way, you will be able to enjoy the game and once you start getting frustrated, you will not feel so bad like the rest of us who paid the full price."

It was okay but just didn't rock our boat.I pulled it out again and have re-listened to it and must admit it is far better than I remembered. To me it recalls the Machine Head/Fireball era, but updated a bit. I think this was the last album with the classic lineup, not sure about that, but apparently there was enough peace between Blackmore and Gillan to pull of the recording.Not their best, but not bad at all.

3758459,B004QQLR4M,"Good blade, but expensive.  Beware of different connectors -OE vs. -UB","I am rating the product one star to draw attention to my review.  The blade itself is good.  The materials, construction, and water removal are all good.  I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24"" factory one on the driver side.  The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly.  If I were to rate the product, I'd rate it 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model.  I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle.  I ordered C-20-OE and C-26-OE from Amazon Vine (which did not have the benefit of the Amazon fit guide) for the 2009 Toyota Highlander, and they do not fit.  I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment.  My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the ""cane handle"" type of a windshield wiper arm.  Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector.  Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an ""OE-style spoiler"", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to.  Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a ""cane handle"" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive.  I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two.  These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate).  I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24"" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does.  On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour).  I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me.  I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better."

They're pretty picky chewers, but once they get to work - they do...A week into it, and these are just one of many toys they chew on, small parts started falling off from the both ends of the bone and I started finding small bits of white plastic or whatever this is made of on the floor. After a couple of times my dog swallowed it a piece and started coughing, I decided to throw away...I got 2 of the giant bones, and one was for a 30lbs 8mos old puppy and still wasn't in a much better shape than the one taken on by my golden. My golden shredded his much faster. I did heed the warning and give these under supervision only - but they'd really need to be far sturdier to pass as suitable for moderate to strong chewers...."

And the so-called double the D's, the producers failed math class too.  For anyone who has $20 to throw away, throw it away somewhere else.  This was a bad B rated movie.  Wish I didn't waste my money ... or time."
1465514,B003RSFQII,"A must buy, but with some disappointments","As a Wii-only owner, it's frustrating to see how the system is so frequently short-changed by developers. Despite being the least powerful system in its generation, the Wii still has potential that goes largely untapped by most developers other than Nintendo. In the case of Rock Band 3, I'm happy to report that, for the most part, it takes full advantage of what the Wii is capable of. Finally, users can download up to 32GB of DLC via the SD slot, take advantage of song exporting (though only RB2 and Green Day Rock Band are permitted now), track packs in the music store, and have all the same modes and functions as the 360/PS3 iterations, including the new Pro mode.Of course, RB3 also introduces a brand new instrument with the keyboard. I won't be speaking too much about it, as I'm reviewing the game rather than the bundle, but it is worth picking up if you're interested in learning the keys, because it's a Pro-mode instrument out of the box. (Guitar, bass, and drums will require add-ons or all new instrument purchases in order to take advantage of their Pro modes.) The game includes some decent tutorials that attempt to teach you how to play the real thing, and playing Pro mode on each instrument is just like playing the songs in real life...because you're basically doing just that. It adds a new level of difficulty, but I wouldn't recommend putting down that kind of cash unless you're actually interested in learning the instrument or skilled enough to play at that level. If you're buying the game mostly for the social aspect, your old plastic instruments will work just fine. Also, I'd say buying the keyboard is contingent upon your interest in learning the keyboard and/or your desire to add a new instrument for another player. If you don't have a second guitar for bass, it can also play those parts (guitar parts as well), so it's worth picking up for that. But I haven't found myself too enthralled by the keyboard parts on most of the songs. (Some Ben Folds would change my opinion on this--a huge missed opportunity!) So is the keyboard worth it? It's really up to you...I bought it, because I'd love to work myself up to Pro mode, but I still find myself going back to guitar and drums most often.All of RB2's features such as the character creator are still here, and largely improved. A notable difference between RB3 and its predecessor is that all of the on-disc songs are unlocked from the beginning, which is welcome if you just want to buy the game to play at parties. The career mode is also obviously present, but I personally prefer the way it was in RB2...RB3 just seems like a list of challenges rather than progressing through cities and venues as in RB2, which to me, gave more of a feeling of being in a real band. Another slight disappointment in comparison to RB2 is the graphics...somehow, RB2 looked prettier, which doesn't make sense because they've had two years to improve, and games like Super Mario Galaxy 2 have come along since that really display how beautiful Wii games can look. Also, while I like the drop-in/drop-out style of navigation, the text size of many menus is too small and I frequently have to stand closer to the TV to read it.In terms of DLC, the catalog is bigger than ever, and while I'm happy to see Rock Band Network tracks finally being released to Wii, both Wii and PS3 owners still don't have access to the full RBN store, which remains exclusive to 360. Harmonix's excuse for not including this on Wii upon launching was that it would require a patch to RB2, which is a no-go on Wii, but now there's no excuse for not having this up and running for RB3. Instead, Wii/PS3 owners get ""featured selections"" from the RBN store, which is better than nothing, but still leaves room for improvement. It's also disappointing that as of this writing, only RB2 and Green Day RB are available to export into the Wii version of the game. Everything leading up to launch indicated that RB1, Lego RB, and the track pack discs would be available to export across all platforms, not merely on PS3 and 360. Given that up to 32GB of space is now available on Wii, there's no excuse to not allow these discs to export.It's worth noting that Rock Band on Wii was a lazy PS2 port until Vicarious Visions, the team responsible for the Guitar Hero series on Wii, proved just how much is possible with GH:WT and GH5. Though I consider those games inferior on most levels, they paved the way for DLC, online modes, track packs, song exporting, and more that Harmonix once claimed wasn't possible due to ""the limitations of the Wii."" Giving credit where it's due, I really believe this game wouldn't be nearly what it is on Wii without Vicarious Visions showing Harmonix how to make it work on the system. With Viacom's looming sale of Harmonix, I'm in the minority who is hoping that Activision will swoop them up so Vicarious Visions can take over on the Wii side of things and do for Rock Band what they've done for Guitar Hero on the platform.Furthermore, I still prefer Red Octane's Wii guitars and maybe even drums, primarily because they use the Wii Remote to go wireless rather than requiring a separate USB dongle and another set of batteries. The good thing is, they are compatible with every RB game since RB2, as well as every GH game. If you don't already have a set of instruments and you're not planning to go Pro, I'd recommend those available from Red Octane...you may even be able to find a GH/Band Hero bundle on sale to net you these instruments. I find them to be more sturdy and easier to play with, too.Aside from a few disappointments, RB3 really delivers on Wii and I'd recommend it over any other rhythm game on the console, particularly for the huge DLC catalog and superior presentation. Overall, RB3 is a big step forward, but I think they could go even further, particularly on Wii. There's also a long way to go when it comes to the music store--I'd personally love to see it rival iTunes as a digital retailer, allowing DLC to transfer to your hard drive as MP3s. So while there are plenty of improvements in this entry to the series, it's not yet perfect. Still, RB3 is the current king of music games and I must label it a must buy.UPDATE 11/24: Something was made aware to me this week when I took the game out to play as a full band with some friends. ""All Instruments Mode"" must be activated to play keys with more than one other guitar. This forces you to have a vocalist in your band...which isn't a huge deal, as vocals aren't scored in this mode, but it seems sloppy from a game design perspective. There's no way to play the four instruments without having a vocalist...it's forced upon you, and you can't de-activate the mode without backing out of a set. Also, the background animation during this mode is limited to music visualization...no band, no venue, etc., and the visualization is often distracting, sometimes making the notes more difficult to see. It's very disappointing that you can't even see your band when playing as a full band! At the very least, they should have had pre-rendered video of your band for this mode.If there's an upside to All Instruments Mode, it's that someone can jump in and sing whenever they feel the urge, and not have to worry about failing out. But overall, it's disappointing that they couldn't have incorporated the keys more seamlessly. You shouldn't need to go into this mode at all unless you're playing with 5 or more players.I'm also disappointed that the game still doesn't allow more than one player on guitar in band mode, as Guitar Hero does, rather than forcing one of the guitar controllers to play bass. Bass can be just as fun, but you often have both people on guitar wanting to play the guitar part, and I don't know why they wouldn't make that possible. This is especially frustrating when it comes to the keys, which *can* play bass/guitar parts...unless you already have a bassist and a guitarist, in which case, you have to limit yourself to the songs with keys support if you want to include your keyboardist. Why can't I have three guitarists if I want to?While these things don't change my score, I've gotta say it makes RB3 seem less polished than RB2, despite the new features."

1443810,B002I0J6DC,Too Much and Too Little,"This game would be good on its own right except that it's part of the Castlevania series.  This game in no way feels like a Castlevania game to me.  It's too quick paced and seems to incorporate a couple other games instead... God of War and Demon Stone.  I'm a big fan of Castlevania games... that is until this one.  I suppose I would like it better if I didn't have to remember all the different button combinations it takes to do the simplest of tasks.  Sure, it's full of heart pumping action and such, but that's not the kind of games I play.  Castlevania Lament of Innocence is the last game I consider a TRUE Castlevania game.  If you're not an avid fan of the Castlevania series like I am this game is alright, but if you are, they need to make something that follows the series much more originally.  I paid $50 too much for this game being that it was $50 when I bought it.  I'm putting mine up for sale..."
1614533,B0033HPPIY,Not So Good..,I really wanted to like this flavor of K-Cups but it's just not that good.

I own a dog service business and none of my clients dogs ate it either.  Really disappointed since I thought it would be good to support a company that made this in the US.

1306734,B00000K4AX,My new favorite game,"I bought this game about a year ago, played it for one day, and for some reason stopped playing it. I guess it just didn't appeal to me that day. I finished Half-Life a few days ago and was looking for something else to entertain me, but I didn't think anything was going to satisfy me as much as Half-Life did. I reinstalled System Shock 2 and decided to give it another try...best thing I ever did. And as a matter of fact this has become one of my all time favorite games I have ever played, and some might call me crazy but I find this game to be FAR better than Half-Life.The graphics are excellent and the sounds are top notch. You really feel as if you are part of this doomed spacecraft. Things jump out at you and pieces of debris come flying at and down on top of you which has caused me to jump out of my seat a few times.The interface is very easy to work with and you'll have it mastered in no time.There are different approaches you can take throughout the game. Some of my favorite things are modifying weapons and hacking into security computers and vending machines.I could go on and on about this game but theres no need to, just read the other reviews and you know that this game is great! I highly recommend it to anyone!Many people may not know this, but Bioshock was stated by the games creator to be a ""spiritual successor"" to System Shock 2."
2324685,6304872542,Everything you've heard is true...,"...it really isn't very good.  Believe it or not, I'm actually a huge fan of season 22. But ""Timelash"" sticks out like nothing else. It's mostly the plot which is at fault - to be blunt, it's very weak, filled with dull action being extended beyond any sense of proper pacing. There might just be enough story to fill one 45 minute episode, but with two it's simply a sleep-inducer. Things are not helped by the faceless characters and the bad acting on the part of everyone save Colin Baker and perhaps Nicola Bryant and Paul Darrow. And let's not forget the substandard (and for DW no less!) production values either - I suppose from some standpoints they are amusing enough to keep the viewer awake. On the plus side, it's not very hard to understand. But I would definitely recommend any of the other season 22 stories on tape or DVD first, especially ""Vengenace on Varos"" or ""Revelation of the Daleks."""

1882258,B004UBU9DI,Ledisi The Three Time Winner,"It's really difficult to find much to criticize about Ledisi. The city of Oakland has always been an excellent breeding ground for R&B;,funk and soul. Tower Of Power and The Pointer Sisters both hail from there. And considering Sly's presense in Frisco we have one big West Coast twin city party that's been boogying on for over forty years. Ledisi makes it clear she will continue innovating in that grand tradition,adding both the contemporary spice of neo/retro soul in with.....just her plain old great way at handling a song. She's a singer/songwriter with a great lyrical flair and a jazzy inspired,rangey singing voice to match it. The fact alone that she is intent on putting a contemporary spin on her own musical ideas,as opposed to SURRENDERING ENTIRELY to modern sounds speaks volumes for her creative vision. And she makes sure she's getting as many people interested to take the ride with her.The first track really spells it out. A midtempo,dramatic soul number with a great gospel style harmonics she lets us know ""she's a woman"" for sure but no threat either-just self assured enough to be genuinely happy. ""So Into You"" and ""Stay Together"",featuring Jaheim fins Ledesi in a shuffling sophistifunk kind of mode-musically and lyrically modern enough to make it but also with a great ""old school"" sense of natural confidence. ""Bravo"" is far more modern lyrically and musically,not the strongest tune here but flows well in it's own way. ""Coffee"" is amazing,very dramatically cinascope style funk comparing the man in her life to ""her favorite cup of coffee"" and the high she gets from the emotion. Very very much in the blues/jazz tradition as well. On the Aretha-like ballad ""Hate Me"" she's well aware of the relationship problem but takes a ""that's life"" approch to it basically. Songs such as ""Shine,""BGTY"" and ""Raise Up"" all showcase the more retro aspect of her talent as the beautifully orchestrated and chorded ballad ""I Gotta Get To You"" ends the album on an extremely strong note.Being able to match a strong songcraft ethic with soulful atmospherics and funky grooves is not as simple as one might think. Especially if one comes at it from something of a jazz point of view. It not only requires a sense of history but one of futurism as well. With those sounds as genres the idea of ""the one coming up tomorrow"" will generally be somewhere in mind. On this album Ledisi doesn't choose to rely on a lot (if any at all) popular hip-hop figures to give her music a leg up. And if this album is any indication,with it's strong mix of consistancy and variety she is poised to enter into the world of neo/retro soul song stylists that was already looking impressive before she debuted. And that includes honored elders such as Mary J Blige,Faith Evans and newer successors such as Alicia Keys,Jill Scott,Georgia Anne Muldrow and the wonderful Chrissette Michelle. All of these people got over by keeping up with their ""original flava"" to coin the phrase. And if this is any indication Ledisi has PLENTY of that going on. Something many generations can sing and boogie to. That says it all."
1798473,B005JRJE6A,Silly tool,"This is a combination angle grinder and small circular saw of sorts, but I think most consumers are unaware of the inherent limitations or AC motors that make combining the two tools infeasible.Grinding requires high RPMs and low torque. Cutting generally requires lower RPMs with higher torque. AC Motor torque and speed are hard to variate. They are fixed to AC mains power frequency, and the winding of the motor itself. This tool doesn't even attempt it, because a motor designed to operate at 17000 RPMs (high even for grinders, owing to the undersized blade) would have too little torque at cutting speeds around half that. Most tools that are variable speed use a variable resistor that crudely starves the motor of power, consequently, it generates heat and torque goes down dramatically (non-linear). In theory these tools could use three-phase motors and variable frequency drives, but that would be far more expensive than simply using two tools, not to mention you'd have trouble fitting it into the enclosure of a hand tool. Sometimes the inefficiency doesn't matter. A drill, for instance, is optimized for full speed but the low speed torque that is converted to heat is not needed to start a hole. The applications of a drill also allows for a person to react to feedback and apply more power when necessary. This is not the case when cutting, as the feedback loop is too volatile and human response times are too slow.All this to say... The SawMax amounts to an angle grinder missing its angle and handle, with a plastic circular saw like outfitting attached to a clumsy plastic enclosure, that burns wood when you cut it, melts metal when you grind it, and eats through wheels as if it were designed to ; )Buy the right tools for the job.P.S.* There are many small circular saws that operate at RPMs appropriate for cutting.* Angle grinders are AWESOME.* A 5"" angle grinder usually operates around 10k RPM.As you can see, this has performance characteristics of a grinder in the extrapolated inches-per-minute.5""*pi*10k = ~157k IPM  (common angle grinder)3""*pi*17k = ~160k IPM  (saw max)* The iconic Dremel rotary tool is called a ""Die Grinder"". You can just buy a real one."

Done off screen, how old fashion (a notch below hearing the gunshot, clutching one's chest, and falling over, no blood).  It seemed a cowardly route to go, killing without the fuss or muss.  But killing just the same, so what's the point in hiding it?  Then there's a squad of KGB that manages to infiltrate the US......on a communist visa no doubt.  Better dead than red!

134040,B009WO3H3M,Nice Concept.. Fits iPhone 5- But Highly Unsafe....,"This is an interesting iPhone 5 case which I happen not to be to fond of. It's a smartphone case with an app essential, available in a variety of colors. It is a 1 piece design case, and allows access to all buttons and ports. The case is scratch resistant and is soft to the touch. Its made of a polycarbonate shell. Now how does it work? The case (case app) can connect your social networking profiles, recover your phone if lost, share your contact information and more. Basically you scan the QR code of your case... so you can have a friend scan your QR code on your case and it will pull all the information that you have stored in it- contacts, social networks, etc.So how can this be unsafe? In my opinion if I lost my phone... and the person saw this case with QR code; I'm sure they would remove the case. Chances are I wouldn't find my phone. We actually did have an iPhone stolen from us once with the iPhone locator on it. However the person reset the phone and all apps were erased. In the end... if its gonna be stolen, no app or case can prevent if the person knows what they are doing. Second.. I don't like the idea I could be out getting coffee and put my phone down to have someone ""scan"" my case and get info.. wheres the security? Sure, that may not happen but if you did put your phone down all it takes is a fast scan- especially if you store alot of info in it. And finally, I prefer a case that will protect my phone as well. We have kids, a toddler and a teen - but he is special needs so at times things fall get knocked down - I want a case that can withstand that - and my Otter Box has over the years ever since iphone came out. I 100% am behind an Otterbox for protection.Perhaps this case may work well for you and you like the QR feature- but please be careful as again their is no security behind it."

This isn't the place to give negative reviews about the G.O.A.T. (greatest musician of all time).

Although time had to be conserved while making the double cd, I didnt care for 45 single edited verions of Don't Stop Till You Get Enough (you DONT CUT OUT THE INTRO, you edit it like it was on the video) and Wanna Be Startin Somethin'.  The later was the first time it was included on any cd and was edited terribily.  Ditto for Thriller.  Other than 45 versions and absense of I'll Be There, Lovely One and Say Say Say, CD 1 displayed MJ's best.  As for CD 2 (stuff from Bad, Dangerous, and one each from History and Invincible) I could care less, but I do agree with previous reviews about adding Scream (with Janet - #2 R&B and #5 pop) instead of Dangerous (which was NOT even a hit in the U.S.).  If the record company was to include MJ's lp tracks, they should put in Lady In My Life or Workin' Day & Night.  Although I do not actually own a copy (I listen to most of the edited songs), They did pick most of the good songs to be included, but Thriller, Dont Stop, Off The Wall (too) and Wanna Be Startin Somethin' are hit songs that should NOT be included edited! - Nuff Said"
1302828,B005CX4GLE,Cheaper alternative,"This is a cheaper alternative to the &#34;String Swing&#34; wall mount-- considerably less expensive.  It works fine.  It's easy to mount, easy to adjust and holds the instrument well.  The only downside is that the wall anchors aren't the heavy-duty plastic screw-in types but the smaller drill-a-hole-and-hammer-in-place types, which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others.  Of course you can always purchase a couple of screw-in heavy-duty mounts and you'll still save considerably.This of course doesn't have the beautiful hardwood finish of the String Swing.  For the lower price you get black plastic.  But it's sturdy enough, it looks fine and it does the job.  If it had sturdier wall mounts I'd give it 5 stars.  As it is, the cheaper and less-trustworthy mounts bring it 4 stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative.

590085,B004SV7744,About as good as free commercial driven radio can get.,"Having tried many differant &#34;free&#34; internet radio pages, I have since whittled the list down to 2 that I use consistantly: Slacker and Pandora. They both perform very well, Slacker focusing more detail in creating custom stations while Pandora's much more open in the music they select for their custom stations, giving you a wider selection. I tend to prefer the way Slacker fine tunes its offerings, using Pandora more during the holidays. They both have a limited number of daily skips on the free version and Slacker seems to have a bit more paid advertisements, though not enough to get annoying. They also both offer a subscription service that eliminates commercials and skip counts (unlimited skips), and Slacker offers ability to choose actual music being played, downloadable music, and a host of other neat features. Not as sure about Pandora's. I DO know that both are terrific sites, with the free version being enough for casual listeners like myself, and the relatively small subscription fee being well worth it if you are an avidinternet music user."

4171,B000WHK3V2,Worthless.,"HOLY MOLY what a piece of garbage!  This has got to be the cheapest/dumbest iPhone case ever made!  Let me begin:I have an iPhone 4S 64 gig phone thing.  I wanted a cheap black case for it.  I wasn't too concered with protection or whatever - just something to cover it.  This one looks good.  Look at the pics - looks nice, right?  Wrong!It's a cheap piece of bended metal/plastic.  My phone fits in it - kinda - but it sure doesn't feel secure!  It's like a rounded piece of plastic - whereas your phone, if you'll observe it - has SQUARED edges!  The part that really bugged me is that it doesn't fit snug AT ALL: See the main photo here?  The one where you can see the back of the phone?  See how that apple symbol on the back of the phone lines up nice and flush with the back?  that is a LIE!  It's not flush at all!  There's like a huge GAP between the back of the phone and the back of this case - it feels TERRIBLE.Most of the ports are accessible when this thing is on - but good luck using the volume switches on the side of your iphone!  You CAN'T.  This case has this rounded-edge thing going on, which prevents your fingertips from getting to those side switches. What a dumb design!-Seriously - I know you're looking for a cheap case - this ain't it!  Believe me when I tell you to spend a few bucks more and get something you'll actually USE and ENJOY.  This is utter garbage!"

1840206,B000002OG8,One Of The Best Of The 70's,"I am an unabashed fan of Wishbone Ash.This album is the one that first made me a fan.I first heard about ""Argus"" from a good friend who was a talented young guitarist at the time.He was very impressed by the harmony-based,twin guitar leads.If anything,he understated the mastery present on this album.Yeah,I know I'm gushing,but,""Argus"" deserves it.When I bought the original LP,I was blown away by not just the guitar,but also the songs and the whole band's chops;they are simply all very talented musicians.The whole'sword and sorcery'bit has been done to death in the years since,but,in the early 70's it was new and very different from the other music around at the time.All the songs are strong and,with an exception or two,follow a progression of a story.My favorite was,and is,""Warrior"".From the first time I heard the lyrics,""I've got to be warrior,a slave I couldn't be.A soldier and a conqueror,fighting to be free"",I was hooked.This CD brings the album into the modern era.Its sonics are far superior to the original CD and yet don't overpower your memories of the original LP.Anyone who has ever picked up an electric guitar and tried to play should have this CD.Anyone who ever wondered why guitarists play until their fingers bleed out of sheer love of the sounds they can make should buy this CD.Anyone who has ever loved the sound of Rock guitar played way beyond most people's abilities should grab this CD.YOU should buy this CD and play it loud.If you don't shout for joy at the sound of ""Argus"",you don't deserve to call yourself a Rock fan."

1527818,B00D4WTO1M,Lag compensation punishes good connections,"I really shouldn't have bought this, knowing Call of Duty's recent (or perhaps not-so-recent) history with a flawed lag compensation system that punishes players with good internet connections. But there weren't many shooters available for the PS4 at the time, so I decided to buy this along with the console.It was a mistake, because the lag compensation still seemingly gives players with fast internet connections like me a disadvantage. Sometimes, I'm clearly playing against Japanese, Mexican, or Brazilian players, and they would just run around corners and kill me instantly before I barely have any chance to react. The game is simply frustrating and un-fun for this reason alone.If that weren't bad enough, the game is just poorly designed overall, in so many respects. The maps are way too large and cluttered, and promote campers. And the weapons are extremely overpowered and kill almost instantly, again rewarding campers. The overpowered weapons also rewards noobs that can't aim, and simply resort to a ""spray-and-pray"" tactic of killing people, which works with surprising efficacy. Overall, this game is terrible online, and once I do a quick run-through of the 4-6 hour story mode, I'll be gladly selling it off. Good riddance."

3305757,B004LXBKEC,2.25 Stars: Megan is Missing...but who cares?,"After glancing over some of the other reviews of this film, I have to ask myself this question: Was I watching the same film as a lot of these other people? Several reviews mention words and phrases like ""graphic"", ""realistic"", and ""very disturbing"". Perhaps me being a horror fanatic and that I have seen so many horror films, that I've become a bit desensitized. Perhaps its because I have no children of my own that I don't see the true horror for maybe someone that may be a parent and then viewing this film. But whatever the case, those phrases don't really to come to my mind at all after watching this film. First off, the attempt to do a movie using ""web cam"" and camcorder footage for a more realistic movie viewing experience, is getting a bit tired. Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, Quarantine are some that come right to mind. Not saying those are all bad movies, in fact I like all those films for the most part, but at some point it just gets a bit old. Perhaps the right concept is there. A cautionary tale for today's youth about using the internet for talking to and meeting strangers, etc. But it wasn't done quite effectively. First off, the acting was sub par. Their line delivery is like watching people reading off lines of dialogue (Except for Amy's character in the last 20 minutes, which was quite good). Besides that however, the Megan character is for the most part unappealing in the fact that she is pretty much a dope head wannabe slut that treats most people badly or just uses them (with the exception of Amy). For me, its hard to feel much empathy for a character that's portrayed in that way. Other problems I had were the ""cell phone cameras"" or whatever they were. How were we actually seeing the characters on their cell phones when they were talking to each other? They used the same ""web cam"" effect on the cell phones too? That made no sense to me. Another thing was the ""breaking news reports"" that were shown. They were laughable. Its like the movie was making fun of itself. At that point I couldn't take the movie seriously. The only redeeming quality this film has was the last 20 minutes or so, when you are taken into a dungeon of sorts while the killer is using Amy's camcorder to document his acts. Yeah, the implied rape scene was a bit bothersome I suppose. As well as the revealed fate of Megan. But still yet, the makers of this film managed to mess this up too, with an extra boring and unnecessary extended digging scene that seems to go on forever! The movie itself is just under 90 minutes, so maybe they were just trying to fill up some screen time. But that scene just ruined what little momentum the film had in the last 20 minutes. Overall, the film isn't the worst I've seen, and again, perhaps the concept is there, but it was done fairly poorly. Again, all these reviews calling this movie so graphic and disturbing are, in my opinion, overreacting. I've seen far far more graphic films than this. People have said this is a film that girls or teens should watch to show what could happen. And I suppose if a 13-16 year old that hasn't seen many scary movies were to watch this, it might shake them up a bit. But as for me, I would be more upset at my parents for making me waste almost 90 minutes of my life while I could have been doing something else..perhaps chatting to a new ""friend"" I met online.;)"
67554,B006AB0JMC,"Review on product overall, not seller or this specific device","This review is for the Motorola Atrix 2 in general, not necessarily this specific phone that may or may be unlocked (from the looks of the other reviews). I do not recommend the Atrix 2. If you are looking for a quality upgrade to the original Atrix, which was a groundbreaking phone way ahead of its time, this is NOT it. The Atrix 2 has terrible battery life, lags, and is overall the opposite of all the great things the Atrix was. I have had this phone for over a year now and I couldn't be more ancy to get a new one. If you are looking for a quality motorola product, go with the original Atrix (which I have had and loved every minute of it) or the Atrix HD (I have not owned this phone but have heard great things from friends). Moral of the story: SKIP IT"

I've used it for 8 months with no issues at all. It sounds great, it works perfectly and it was $40. As for quality control, I have several Joyo pedals, and I can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome. I've never used a Phase 90, so the ""clone"" factor was a moot point when I purchased the Joyo Vintage Phaser. It works, it's simple to use and I had money left over to buy more gear. I've been playing for 29 years and I highly recommend Joyo pedals. If you don't like it, get a refund. It's not rocket surgery."

So, juice is not a daily thing for our kids; rather it's seen as a special treat.  I gave the V8 Fusion fruit punch to 4 girls after they were done jumping on the trampoline and I asked them what they all thought.  They all said ""good.""  I was ready to write my review and then saw quite a few negative reviews so I decided to give it a try.  I shook it up (even though it doesn't say too), put in the straw, and tried it.  It's not bad it's not great. I can tell it's not 100% (it's 60%) but I don't think too many kids would go for real juiced sweet potatoes, carrots, grapes, cherries, and pomegranates regardless if it's in a glass or box.  I think it's a great alternative for regular juice boxes or Capri suns; however the cost might be a big deterrent for most people."

It just don't get no funkier.Paris sure got it goin' on; this is yet another killing live show from the town that makes everyone play at the outer limits of their abilities.I took the funkiest tracks from this and the Dallas '68 JB cd and put them together on my mp3 player for running, and I can blow out mile after mile without even noticing; take out the ballads and those shows are like a lightning bolt.The Maceo JB band was super tight, and this band was super rubbery. Both were extreme Funk, inventing the genre as they went. No one has come close to this day; this is the fonk from the Source itself.JB was the original black power superstar, and in 1971 he was a true revolutionary. That power fairly crackles throughout this recording, and when it busts loose on Ain't It Funky, New Day, Sex Machine and Give It Up, there is an almost mystical energy created, like the sound a sperm might make when it beats the pack of a hundred million and slides in to the egg first.Bootsy is 19 here (!!!), and he and his brother Phelps bring a loping intensity that has never been equalled; this may be the funkiest bass playing ever captured on tape. I've loved JB since hearing Brand New Bag in grade school, and always knew there must be a live recording that captured the essence of him at this funkiest.Here it is.James' voice wavers at points (ten shows in six days in Paris, just another stand in yet another town...hardest workin' man in show biz indeed), but his energy and conviction drive his band to the height of heights, funktually speaking.Just program Ain't It Funky on your cd player to wake you up. You WILL get up and dance in the shower.Good God!"

I had to place an order with another website a day ago, and it's already enroute by Fed Ex. I'll get it before I get the Amazon order.Moral of the story is that Amazon has gotten too big for its britches.

1298482,B000FIZISQ,I don't like it.,"This one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. The fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it's just like most of the other made in China guitar. From the reviews I was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but I'm not at all impressed. One thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.I recently bought a Johnson JG-610-N, a Johnson JG-620-N, a Bristol BD-16, a Jasmine S35, and this Yamaha. If I'd only played the Yamaha I'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side I can definitely say it's not at all amazing. The Bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. The Johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. The Jasmine is nice but I haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.The Yamaha FG700GS is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch. Now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. The Bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. Also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the Yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.Can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit ""hive mind"" where everybody buys into a hype. Maybe I got a dud guitar, but I doubt it, they're all made in the same factory."

428080,B004P3P2U6,Nothing better to quit smoking!,I'm a smoker who has tried patches and gums. In my opinion there is nothing better to help you quit smoking than these lozenges. e-smokes just perpetuate the habit. Just take them whenever needed. You will need them less and less as the days and perhaps weeks go by. No need to force it. Just take them whenever needed. You will gradually wean yourself off them. All you need is a minimal commitment to quit which is all smokers can initially give. Definitely worth it.

This album also proves that the band is willing to play cover songs written by other artists which is a major accomplishment in itself.As an aside it was with great dismay that I learned that Caroline Corr, the band's drummer is now happily married. No doubt male hearts all over the world were broken upon hearing this news!!!I wish Caroline, Andrea, Sharon and Jim every success which they so richly deserve."
2690540,B0001GH7A4,Nightmare Castle,"Between the overacting and underacting, the LOUD music and the barely comprehensible English dubbing that you can't understand all unless you turn the volume up, I was very disiappointed.  I am used to Steele being a better actress.  In the blonde wig, she looks like the local hooker!  Sorry, but true.  Should have left hair black or whiter or red, or SOMEthing.  Mercy!  Also, besides the low and high volumes, music is good, but tooo LOUD most of the time.  Also, film has white horizontal, rolling lines in it that ruins viewing.  Will probably have to send back.  Do not waste your money unless you are willing to put up with the stated flaws.  Not acceptable in my opinion!Cecy"
1868366,B0002TL6QQ,Mediocre at Best,"Its fitting that Cam's album is made from recycled plastic becasue a good portion of the album is recycled rhymes. For an album that dropped in December 2004, I heard about a third of this album between summer 2003 and summer 2004. This cat is really funny, he bootleg's his own album on Dipset mixtapes and releases the same songs and lyrics on his own in store releases. He has the nerve to have an intro where somebody announces that the album was written in 2001? How ridiculous is that. Get in the studio Cam, you can leave those chickens alone long enough to write some new music. I have about twenty Dip Set Mixtapes and I guarantee some of those verses on the mixtapes I bought last summer (2004) will be on his next album, whenever this lazy cat decides to get off his rear end and loop the old verses together and release another ""new"" album. There are some nice tracks on here, but not many. I'd say I like about a third of the album. Oh, and ""Lord You Know"" is not even on the album. What a joke. I'd say if you are somebody who does not feel like you got robbed when you buy an album that stinks or is even just mediocre, then go ahead and take your chances but you have been warned! But if you demand bang for your buck, don't waste your money. This is the type of album that I'll listen to for a week or two and it will  be a dust collector. If I had it to do over, I woud probably buy it used for 5 bucks, thats about what its worth. A third of the price for a third of an album. I think he just really ran out of things to say and after all the albums and mix-tapes, he pushes no effect on me anymore. I heard everything he has to say....."
1649396,B005CT9OEW,"Green Tea, Blackberry and Pomegranate, Really Good!!!!!","Believe it or not, I'd never had green tea before.  I had heard it was super healthy, so I think I subconsciously thought it would taste really bad if it was really that healthy.  But this green tea tastes really, really good.  I love the blackberry and pomegranate flavor; it is really good.I put a water bottle in the freezer for a quick chill, then I put in a couple of tea bags; sometimes I just do it room temperature.  I'm not a hot-tea drinker, so I won't try it hot.  I only do it cold or room temperature.I can't tell you how great this taste is.  To be healthy, it sure tastes good!Highly recommended if you are a tea drinker.  I am a heavy tea drinker.  I don't usually put sugar in my tea.  98% of the time I drink my tea unsweet.  I know, that sounds odd for a Southerner.  I just don't really care for sweet tea.  I was stationed in the deep South, and they put a LOT of sugar in their tea.  I'd never heard of tea with that much sugar.  I am from the middle South, and we drink our tea with either no sugar or just a little bit of sugar.I suggest you try this tea, as it is really good."
2492016,B00005JLSE,Unwatchable,"I have to admit - I couldn't sit through the whole thing. We skipped through the middle and most of the musical numbers (most of which were terrible).Since there were no &quot;good guys&quot; in this movie, I just hoped that justice would prevail. It didn't. Just a bunch of rotten folks ruining their lives and taking others and singing up a storm about it. The only one in this movie who can really sing is Queen Latifah, and her talent was wasted in this film.And the acting - AWFUL! So amateurish and over-the-top. It was like watching a macabre human cartoon.I am both amazed and utterly disappointed that a film like this could win an Oscar."
9000,B001XXUOQI,Just Right,"This item is just as described, and works right out of the box.

It also indicates that is truly OEM."
2054008,1400322715,"Obama is owned by corporations, just like Romney","The main guy behind this film has questionable moral, intellectual and ethical problems, but that doesn't by itself make the film a joke. Any person educated to the level of a Harvard law professor such as Obama is going to be exposed to the facts about U.S. imperialism, colonialism, militarism, and hegemony worldwide. Why do you think we have the world's largest military, with us butting in to occupy, invade and otherwise anger citizens in more than 100 countries worldwide? But Obama is in no way a leftist, progressive or radical. If he was the anti-colonialist, socialist radical that this movie paints him to be,when he came into office he would have done almost everything differently. He is just a neoconservative Dem, in the mold of Clinton. The policies of the Democrats and GOP are pretty much the same on almost all issues other than the fact that the GOP wants women to be forced to carry the babies of rapists. This is a good propaganda film. I would like to see Michael Moore make on on Dinesh, Romney and the corporate rulers such as the Koch Brothers. It would be less propaganda, and more on the side of regular Americans, than this well-crafted hit piece."

1519959,B00BCEK2LK,Good no-frills high DPI gaming mouse,"Logitech serves up an outstanding, simple, no-frills high performance gaming mouse with the G100s.  This is a light weight ergonomic mouse with an extremely high dpi optical sensor.  It's simple and especially great for RTS and FPS games.  If you don't want a mouse that looks like a transformer and 15-zillion buttons to macro everything but your microwave oven, then this is a nice choice.  There are no frills here: the cord is just a good old cord (not one of those braided ropes); theres no little compartment for sliding in extra weights and you get a standard scroll wheel.  On the flip side, you aren't paying for all the extra fluff if you don't happen to want/need it.  That being said, I am definitely a fan of the mouse, however, I do think the price is a just a tad high.  This is a value gaming mouse, to be sure.  But, for the performance its a very good buy."

1303055,B005MR6IHK,Great alternative to a Snark,"I have owned two Snark headstock tuners (the blue ones). They are great products but I find one thing about them absolutely infuriating: the design of the ""ball joint"" that connects the tuner to the clip. Both of my Snarks have broken off at this joint. I am a home player - I do not put the tuners under any type of stress.This Fender tuner is a great alternative. The way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a Snark. However, as others have mentioned, this Fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a Snark. So, for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented. However, for the home player, this tuner will work just fine.The tuner itself is much smaller than I thought it would be. It is smaller than a Snark (but not by much). The clip works well with a PRS headstock, which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a Strat style headstock.The only real negative I see is to change the battery (and to put the first battery in) requires the use of a very, very small phillips head screwdriver. I build computers so I had one handy, but I would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand."

In Vancouver we have lotsa rain, so I look forward to seeing how it handles wet & at times cold weather.UPDATE Sept 11, 2012After 3 months this unit still worked great...between June 11 & now, the unit was subjected to a month or so of hot weather(30-32C), heavy rain, sun, etc etc. I have since ordered another unit.Quality of light has not changed, batteries seem to be holding up well.....next test would be after the cold winter months...in Vancouver we do get down to -5 celcius temps in Dec/Jan, I'll report back as to how well the units fare in the spring (2013)UPDATE April 15, 2013My unit did not survive winter, stopped working in DEC 2012...reducing rating to just 2 stars as my rating."

It's nothing but dissonance, and I can't really say I enjoy listening to screeching noises, something akin to the sound Jim Carrey made in the car next to the Hitchhiker in Dumb 'n' Dumber.  My god, Lady Gaga......this album totally blows.  I was so excited for it because Born this Way was amazing.  and then every other song is just GOD AWFUL.

My nails chip, my skin gets dry, and my hair gets brittle. It's accomplishing the exact opposite of what biotin is used for! I am not a fan. Half-way through this bottle I bought a new bottle of my old brand. After just a week my nails were healthy again, my hair was growing and soft, and my skin felt more moisturized. Maybe I got a bad batch, but this stuff is junk.Pros- Cheap- Pretty bottleCons- Weak or Bad formula. Made my hair, nails, and skin incredibly dry."

1454388,B0036FBERE,GTA IV: EPISODES FROM THE ...BlueScreenOfDeath,"I have thousands of PC games and, over the years, I have had both good and bad experiences - and everything in between. I can now say that GTA4-EfLC has secured its place amongst the worst gaming experiences I ever had.GTA III was excellent, the best of the series. GTA IV was not a bad game but, similar to the original BIOSHOCK, it was not worth its idiotic DRM scheme troubles. Hoping that ROCKSTAR had cleaned up its act I made the mistake in giving in to compulsion and buying this from STEAM, where it was on sale. Unfortunately, no matter how cheap one buys a worthless product, it is already too expensive.I have a year old gaming system at home (i7 920 on a MSI Eclipse with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and a GTX260 nVidia, running WinXP SP3) on which I hardly had any problems running games, old and new alike. It took some hours to complete the download and installation of the about 16GB(!) required for this installment of GTA IV. Since I already had a WindowsLIVE and a Rockstar Social Club Accounts, I just logged in and waited for the game to start. But that was not in the cards. The draconian and convoluted DRM scheme made sure of that. The game kept crashing - over and over!Writing to STEAM only got me a ""we do not offer support to third-party products"" reply. Cute. They just sell the stuff, why should they make sure it works as promised, right? And by writing to ROCKSTAR I received a cut&paste; ""hit the help fora and see what crawls out"" response. No much, it turns out, when it comes to effective advice.I tried cleaning my registry and temp folders as suggested by some fellow gamers to no avail: the game still crashed just past the initial character-slides/loading screens.I tried updating all of my drivers, DirectX and Windows Frameworks and this piece of shiit still kept crashing.I even tried uninstalling numerous programs that might conflict with the DRM, such as PowerISO (as SecuROM is known to be...nervous in its company) - and was rewarded by a BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH! That sure brought back memories, I hadn't had one of those for years!After deleting the local content I thought about having my credit card company cancel the transaction on the basis that the product I bought never worked. Instead, I decide to pay my bill - to help me remember.Remember NEVER TO BUY ANOTHER ROCKSTAR PRODUCT AGAIN."

We already have a terrible sodium intake problem in this country. Every single one of us gets way more sodium than we need by the time we have had lunch. NOW Foods is not helping. The only reason for them dumping so much salt into this product is for taste, because it is not natural.This is one of the many reasons I normally pass on NOW products. There always seems to be hidden junk in their ""healthy"" products. There are better options and products."

1297984,B000B6FBA2,Will Not Clamp Tightly Enough,"I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;Lite&#34;). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;Lite&#34;."
1302813,B005CX4GLE,CHINA GARBAGE,"It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china.

If you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up.  If you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. I have decided to build my own"

Is this Nokia's exclusive partner ? definitely it is apple's exlusive partner.there was a link for all cell phones under big apple iphones pictures. I clicked the link, it brought to all phones screen with nokia lumia listed at middle, the list was huge, very hard to find. it was not the color I wanted, so I have scrolled down a not others phone in order to find what I wanted.The experience with ATT was so bad. Guess what att would ship it out within 5 to 10 biz days. it listed as out of stock. obviously att not only stocked very few lumia 900 phones  but also stopped ordering from nokia for 2nd week due to the data connectivty issue which was pure software glitch and has already been fixed yesterday.nokia should defintely choose verizon/sprint/tmobile as exclusive partner in the future.SO I went to amazon website, the experience was excellent, just a few clicks after verification of upgrade eligibility, I am done with upgrading. and it is also $50 cheaper than order from att.com.once received the phone, I'll update ratings and my comments."

It made my heels worst and left a dark crust instead.  The stick itself is very oily and melts as you use it. I was able to return it for a full refund with my receipt at hand.  Don't be fooled by these infomercials that promise you the moon.... This product DOES NOT WORK and in fact makes your dry heels worst.  Save your money."

1601606,B00269UWFG,Funny Taste,I bought a few jars of another brand on Amazon and decided to try these as they were cheaper and rated good.  They taste stale and nasty.  They were crunchy but had no taste like a cashew should taste. I cannot find anything on the jar to indicate an expiration date.  I tried giving one to my dog and he wouldn't even eat it.  Now the other brand I loved is cheaper I will be switching back.
1651827,B005K4Q1T0,On subscription for my son,"My son is a Hot Cocoa fanatic.  As I use a Keurig for my coffee each morning, he wanted to try some k-cup hot cocoa.  We settled on the Grove Square due to price.  The challenge with this and any k-cup cocoa is that it is made with water. We traditionally make hot cocoa with milk, so this is not as rich as we are used to drinking.  However, it is pretty good for hot cocoa made with water.  My son uses the smaller cup setting and adds some milk or creamer and it suits him just fine in the morning.  So much so, that he asked for it to be a subscription."

For those who saw this movie and liked it let me say it again if you didnt hear it the first time and from my title of the review, PURE [JUNK]! IT [STUNK]! The plot of this movie was horrendous. There were a few struggles but when it came down to the end it was just...angering, no good story plot. They try to make it up with a bunch of graphics but the audience isnt stupid. When it was done I had the same thought I had for Star Wars The Phantom Menace: THATS IT! I think you get the point...If you value your time on this planet dont watch this movie..."

3756465,B003DKKN7Y,Expendable,"I would not buy this scraper/brush to replace my gas station cheapie.  The scraper is not so sturdy, and while the brush head can be rotated, it's actually shorter than my cheapie.Also, it does not extend.  Wrong item?  I thought perhaps there was another on my newsletter, and I accidentally ordered it instead of the extendable brush.  But there was no other OXO snowbrush, and the item I'm to review is an extendable brush.  But mine isn't.  How I struggled trying to extend the grip from the handle, until I realized the way the handle is made it couldn't possibly extend!  And sure enough, that white button toward the end of the handle that you can see in the product picture is missing from my snowbrush.A mistake can be forgiven, and I've given favorable reviews when I've bought one item and received another - so long as form, fit, and function comply with the product description.  This does not.It's a good thing it has that nice, comfy OXO grip.  I need it for the extra time it takes to brush the snow off my car, and it earned this item two stars, rather than one."

Its pretty fast i get signal everywhere. the only thing is if you use straight talk you cant recieve pics. their apn doesnt unlock pics.. but on the plus side i didn't realize when i bought it you can take screen shots when holding down the volume button & the power button at the same time.everything works great . im glad i got this phone its a good deal for the price"

1302719,B0051WAJ5S,Flimsy!,This stand is ok for light home use. I would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel. Very cheaply made but does the job. Guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot. You must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on  the rack. Avoid if you can spend more.

1858462,B00005QW3E,No USA Release Until 2002?  Are You Kidding Me???,"It's a damn shame, because I have listened to this album several times, and it absolutely blows away her debut!  Natalie showed flashes of what her potential was in Left Of The Middle, but this is a major leap!Sometimes driving, sometimes dreamy, always gorgeous.  There's something sort of an eerie mood about the whole album, and it works wonderfully.  It's immediately addictive, with memorable melodies that carry you throughout.  I'm trying to describe a feeling here ;)Yes, the first single, That Day, is a little strange, and Natalie pulls a bit of Alanis here, squeezing in about 12 syllables where there's room for only about 8, but even this quirky track digs its claws into you and grabs on.  Don't expect the single to be representative of the rest of the album -- it isn't at all.  The only common thread is its addictiveness.Whole-heartily recommended.  It's just a shame people in the USA have to either wait until 2002 or spend through the nose for the import."

121143,B009A5204K,Pause does not work with iPhone 4S,"I purchased this in white as a replacement for an LG Tone that failed after about a year of daily service. I loved my Tone and figured this would be basically the same, but newer. It has some key changes which caused me to return the first one and now the second (in black).The pros:- The sound quality seems to be pretty good (I'm no audiophile, but it sounded good to me).- The form factor is the same.- It puts a neat battery indicator on the iPhoneThe cons:- The volume buttons are reversed which has me constantly moving the volume in the wrong direction.- Now it talks to me. This might be neat the first time, but the indicator beeps from the earlier one were just fine. These take a little longer to listen through. It's minor, but annoying to me.- The pause button does not work consistently with my iPhone 4S. The stop function works and serves largely the same purpose, but I don't want to have to hold the button down for a full second just because I want to hear someone who is trying to talk to me.This last is the biggest irritation for me and the reason I'm switching back to the previous version. The instructions clearly state that a brief push should pause playback and it simply does not do so - no reaction unless you hold it for a second until you get a beep."

1594367,B001LG945O,"Metallic, Sweet, Bad Aftertaste","In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didn't care for to see their reaction.Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame."

To keep this review short, I just don't like it very much.  There are advantages to a fully 3D Roller Coaster game (like being able to ride the rides, and better view of the area and track when building rides) but it just doesn't work for me.Take a look at the original games RCT1 and RCT2 on the website Great Old Games if you really want a roller-coaster and amusement park management game."

1833621,B000002GQI,Their Greatest Album,"This is as cosmic an album that the Moody Blues have ever created.  It contains probably the most etherial, 5 songs in a row than any of their other albums (&#34;Out and In&#34;, &#34;Gypsy&#34;, &#34;Eternity Road&#34;, &#34;The Candle of Life&#34;, and &#34;Sun is Still Shining&#34;). This album clearly shows their awe of the universe and how mankind, despite how important it is; pales when compared to the vastness of space.From the instant that the listener sits down; he's sent off in space via rocketship.  Into the void of space, the listner looks into &#34;The Eyes of A Child (probably a reference to the &#34;Star Child&#34; from the movie &#34;2001; which was released before this album was penned).This concept album is perfect for reflection.  The orchestration, harmonies, hard guitar riffs, Eastern musical tones, and interesting percussion pieces help created one of the more unique albums of the British Invasion.In my opinion, it's when the Moody Blues brought about a perfect balance of introspection, hard rock, creativity and writing.Justin Hayward was flatly wrong in assuming that &#34;Watching and Waiting&#34; would be a hit song.  Although it's dramatically pensive, and well-written, the pace of this song just had no place in mainstream listening; especially when the radio back then was pumping out hard rocking tunes such as &#34;Somebody To Love&#34; by the Jefferson Airplane, or &#34;Locomotive Breath&#34; by Jethro Tull.  Still though, it's a great song.This is probably the finest album that the Moody Blues created.  It's the standard for any Moody Blues fan, and would be an incredible way to increase the depth of knowledge for any fan that loved &#34;Tuesday Afternoon&#34; or &#34;Nights In White Satin'.Not only do I think this is a &#34;must have&#34; for Moody Blues fans, I really, and truly think it's a necessity in any collection of classic rock."
1848839,B00000DQSF,King of debut albums,"It's not hard to see why even giants like Eric Clapton and George Harrison freaked when they first heard the Big Pink acetate. (Jimi and Ringo were there, too, apparently.) Was the subsequent and exponential improvement in their own songwriting mere coincidence? Unlikely. Clapton has said it changed his attitude to music altogether, prompting him to kill off the supergroup thing and put out the magnificent Layla anonymously. And the bootlegs I've heard of George running through All Things Must Pass and Not Guilty at Abbey Road or Twickenham have 'The Band' stamped all over them.Someone once said that Levon Helm was the only drummer who could make you cry, and you can hear just what he meant on the opening track, the Manuel/Dylan tune Tears of Rage, as moving a song as you'll ever hear. Richard could sing a bit.Dylan's contribution also pays big dividends on This Wheel's On Fire, co-written with Danko. Both these tracks can be found on the Basement Tapes, with Dylan singing, and as good as those versions are, they are easily surpassed here.Manuel's We Can Talk is a personal favourite - the wonky harmony vocals, Danko's weird bouncy bass line and Garth Hudson's inimitable keyboards are all typical and marvelous - but Robbie Robertson writes himself into rock history with the almost epic The Weight.Big Pink was nothing like anything else that was being made in the late '60s - there's barely a guitar solo in sight - and though the follow-up eponymous album was probably even better, this remains the definitive debut album. (Not that I've heard every debut album there ever was, but what the hell.)Essential."
3677795,B002J9HQ9S,Made no difference,"I bought this from my vet to help calm my hypervigilant, over active 7-lb Pom x Shih Poo.  I so wish it had worked.  I found it very messy at first, and the Lavender scent was overpowering.  It did seem to slightly relax my other dog, but had virtually no impact on the one who was actually wearing it.  I tried it for the full 30 days to no avail. Might work for some, but didn't for me."

492184,B009HEZ03W,No burp Fish Oil!,"I've been taking fish oil for several years and it's always hit-or-miss whether a particular brand will be easy to digest or leave you with fishy aftertaste.  These are really good quality and don't cause any burp-back after you take them.  I'm impressed that they are triple-distilled which helps to purify it.  It's 800 mg of Omega 3 so if you're going for a therapeutic dose you should take three a day, but I just take one a day and it seems to help with my dry skin and achy joints.After trying out probably a dozen different brands, it's nice to find one that I can stick with!"
1999169,0790743442,Invigorating,"The American Film Institute put out its' list of the top 100 American movies several years ago.  Guess what movie sneaked in at the 100 spot?  You got it; &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;.  Personally, I would have ranked it higher but I was glad to see it on the list because I was afraid it might have gradually become forgotten.  That would be a shame because this is a well-made movie that's a lot of fun.  It's a real rah rah, rally-round-the-flag movie and it came out at just the right time; 1942.  It tells the story of Gearge M. Cohan who was a real rah rah, rally-round-the-flag kind of a guy.  It fits into the classification of a musical although it is much deeper than that.The greatness of this movie is measured by its' cast with the primary focus going to James Cagney.  Cagney is better known for his tough-guy ganster movies but he was an all around entertainer in this movie.  His singing is adequate for the job and his dancing is very very good.  He's a bit stiff legged at times but the choreography seems to play to that aspect.  It's his acting that raises this movie above the level of the standard musical of that era.  Cagney is a fast-talking, wheeler-dealer who thrives on the spotlight.  He seems to be a better Cohan than George M. himself.  This was Cagney's Oscar-winning performance and a well-deserved award it was.If the movie has a short-coming, it's in the portrayal of his marriage.  Joan Leslie plays his wife in the movie and does a good job in that role.  However, the screenwriters left out any scenes that embellish their relationship beyond that of stage partners.  The absence of children and their formal manner of communication left some wondering why they tied the knot.  However, the pace of this movie leaves little time to ponder such things.  Watch this movie and you'll feel like marching in a parade.  It's a real feel-good movie made back in the days when Hollywood knew how to make them."
1300925,B002C741B8,works excellent,"I agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup. It has a very natural sound, is reliable and amazingly strong. The suction cup issue is easy to solve, it just needs to be a bit humid and it will stay well. I also bought (for comparison) the Cherub WCP-60G, which is not bad but has much more of an unnatural metallic sound, plus it seems more feedback-prone than the AXL. I can only recommend, if you have a nice classical guitar and want to amplify it with true sound, the AXL is an excellent and inexpensive solution. I doubt that the $200 stuff is much better."
1826763,B000001FC0,Roland Lets it all out,"Not as raw and emotional as their debut &quot;The Hurting&quot;, &quot;Songs From the Big Chair&quot; is the album that catapulted Curt and Roland into the international consciousness and captured them a place in music history.Big Chair gave TFF two #1 hits, one for the primal &quot;Shout&quot; and the second for the pop perfection of &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;.  My personal favorite on the album is the dark and thrashing combo of &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;Head Over Heels/Broken (Live)&quot;, which is every bit as good as the chart topping singles.  Other standout tracks include &quot;The Working Hour&quot;, &quot;Mother's Talk&quot; (which also placed on the charts) and &quot;I Believe&quot;.  All of the eight original songs are of exceptional quality, and highlight the songwriting and vocal talents of these two young artists.  The remastered version also offers an additional seven bonus tracks, which aren't strictly necessary, but add a great glimpse into their creative process.  Even if they're not up to the level of the original cuts, the bonuses are definitely enjoyable to listen to, and I'm not one to complain about getting extra TFF music.Overall Big Chair is a phenomenal release from a pair of artists whose angst and raw energy permeates their work.  It's unfortunate that this is the only Tears for Fears album that receives significant attention, as their entire catalogue is of exceptional quality.  This is one of those rare albums that is able to transcend its origins ('80's pop), and it belongs on any list of all time classic albums."
1659260,B006Q820S0,"All these bad reviews aren't kidding, folks - quality control on these is terrible","I love a good strong cup of coffee - my favorite K-Cup is the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Extra Bold, but I'll try any of the extra bold varieties and enjoy most of them.  So the ""Fuhgeddabboudit"" flavor intrigued me and I pre-ordered a box of 36 cups.  Took about a month to arrive, and I just tried it this morning.First off, the people talking about these things making messes on the counter aren't kidding.  The very first cup leaked all over the place, and gave me a cup full of grounds.  I was almost reluctant to try another one - something like that can't be very good for your Keurig machine - but gave it a shot.It wasn't bad, but it didn't measure up to the Double Black Diamond, and since it's essentially the same price, why shouldn't I get the stuff I really like instead?  I found the flavor a little thin, lacking the richness of a DBD cup.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.The real trouble is, I'm reluctant to play K-Cup Roulette with these, given that lots of people are apparently having this same issue.  I believe I'm going to contact Amazon about returning these - I'm not willing to risk screwing up my $150 Keurig with poorly-made defective K-Cups.The people at Brooklyn Bean Roastery need to pay a little more attention to quality control.  There's really no excuse for this sort of rampant shoddiness in their products.UPDATE: Amazon refunded my money without even wanting me to return the K-Cups.  Once again Amazon's superb customer service takes care of a problem and makes a customer happy.  If only all businesses were so easy to deal with and focused on doing whatever it takes to satisfy their customers."
2360249,6305715831,A movie with required reading,"The novel, Breakfast of champions, was one of my favorite novels by kurt  v. and i was excitied to watch the movie for the first time. One thought,  however, that kept going though my mind while watching the movie was: I  wonder what people think of this movie if they didn't read the book? This  movie is almost the missing illustrations that should have gone with the  book. YOU MUST READ THE BOOK FIRST in order to understand anything about  this movie. The charecters were done perfectly - and the quick brilliant  one liners are too easily missed if your not ready for them.The book is  brilliant, and can change your outlook on life - one of the rare books that  can keep you entertained with stunning humor and brilliant philosophy. The  movie left me satified and in a great reflective mood, but worried about  all the hapless viewers who didn't do their homework.Any bad reviews you  may read are by people who didn't read the book."

1343706,B00009VE6D,Better than the Last Game,"Return of the King was better than the two towers (not constantly getting knocked down) with more characters to play and new levels from the movie to play and co op mode.

3753771,B001TK0DSY,"Incredible value, mediocre foaming by brush","Let's start with the good stuff. 128 oz, at 1 oz per 5 gal, means that you're going to be using this for a long time. It smells nice. It leaves a decent gloss. I find Meg's NXT wash increases the hydrophobicity of the surface, while CW&G; restores it to pre-dirty condition. That's fine, since I depend on my sealant layer for water beading, and don't particularly care for whatever temporary water beading the wash provides.After hearing everything about the incredible foaming properties of this soap, I was a little disappointed to find it didn't foam especially well by brush. Should it? Maybe not. It still washes just fine. Don't spill any of the soap either, or you'll be washing it out for a long time. The soap does separate rather quickly, but it's no big deal.I'd buy it again, but I won't be doing that for a long time."

3650409,B0014CMQEQ,Worked for a couple weeks...then the cats switched to peeing on the floor,"We have 4 cats. We followed all the instructions exactly, purchasing multiple Breeze systems and transitioning the cats exactly as outlined in the included instructions.  Tidy Cat's behavioral psychologists recommend 1 box for each cats, plus one additional one.All of the cats seemed to be fully transitioned over to the Breeze system at first, then after a couple of weeks, two of them started peeing on the floor. At first we thought the Breeze system just wasn't fighting the odor very well, so we tried rinsing the pellets clean and even changing them more often.  After a couple weeks of putting up with the entire house stinking, we witnessed the cats peeing on the floor. The vet said nothing was wrong with the cats' health.For the short time the cats were using the Breeze system, we had pellets all over the place. The cats had also decided to use one box exclusively for pee, so that box was always practically overflowing, even though we changed the pad every day (sometimes multiple times a day).  Whoever thought a cutout ""entrance"" side was a good idea is an idiot.  At least one of the cats would always stand on the very edge of the box, and upon jumping off of the box, would end up flipping it over.Ultimately, we had to switch two cats back to normal litter, and when we did that, the others also went back to using normal litter. We ended up giving away the Breeze litterboxes and unused pellets and pads to a church garage sale. I doubt they brought in more than $5, if they sold at all.It's probably for the better, though, because Breeze refills would have cost us more than twice what normal clumping litter costs. On top of that, all the pads and pellets required by this system are not very environmentally-friendly, so I'm glad we got rid of it."

1836492,B000002KEN,The Best Of The Original Band,"""Babies"" is in my opinion the high water mark of the original Alice Cooper band.  This album contains everything that made the band great.  Clever lyrics, outstanding music, theater, big hits, and songs guaranteed to make people squirm.  This is the album that would label Alice and the band as superstars, but also label Alice as a demented necrophilliac.  If you only own one album from the original band this is the one to have. The album contains some of Alice's biggest hits and unlike a lot of top 40 radio fodder; every hit on this album is a great song.  ""Hello Hooray"" is the perfect concert opener (not a lot of people know that this is a cover song) and a great song.  ""Elected"" is another great one, Alice's raucous campaign statement.  ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" has become one of Alice's signature songs and another classic.  The title track ""Billion Dollar Babies"" is another killer track with Donovan providing the 2nd lead vocal and lending a creepy ambience that fits perfectly to the song.  The album cuts here are all good too.  ""Raped And Freezing"" and ""Mary Ann"" are probably the weakest ones, but still good.  ""Unfinished Sweet"" is the only song I have ever heard of about going to the Dentist and getting a tooth pulled........and of course this is a demented Dentist.  The song is hilarious.  ""Generation Landslide"" is one of the best songs Cooper ever wrote with great music and thought provoking lyrics that still resonate today.  ""Sick Things"" is the band's tribute to its fans.  Then we come to the album closer and one of the band's most controversial tracks ""I Love The Dead"".  This is the song that basically shocked the world and turned Alice into the rock n roll villain of the 70's.  Of course the kids ate it up.  The song is basically about necrophilia although listening to it today it is done in such a tongue and cheek style that it is hard to believe anyone took this seriously back in the day.  Alice still performs this song in his live shows, usually after he has been executed.  No matter how one feels about the song it certainly stirred up plenty of controversy when it was released and in the consequence made Alice more famous than ever.  The remastered version of this album contains a second disc of mostly live material that is also very good.  This was the Alice Cooper band at their peak."
1831570,B0000029AP,No Obvious Weaknesses,"What some consider to be Aerosmith's best album, Toys in the Attic certainly delivers a rock n' roll wallop!  There just isn't a weak track to be found, here.  If you're new to Aerosmith, this might be a good place to start.  Filler that is anything-but comes between more well known Aerosmith tracks, like ""Toys in the Attic,"" ""Walk This Way,"" and ""Sweet Emotion,"" but great albums aren't simply a collection of hits, and Toys delivers from top to bottom.  If you like rock n' roll, I can't imagine how you might not like this album."

The next two weeks, my cat getting worst and worsted. I took him to a different vet and they found out it was this product that I used that caused the issues.

1868299,B0002S94RK,Beautifully Human - 4.5 stars,"I was reading through some of the reviews and laughed out loud at the one who stated that he/she was hoping to ""get their nod on"" while listening to Jill's album.  I bought her new album with no expectations or comparisons to the first so maybe that's why I was grateful for the new music.My favorite song no doubt is ""My Petition"" and getting to see her perform it live on Tavis Smiley's show was a definite treat.  I truly enjoyed the entire album and am happy that Jill Scott is another artist who continues to ""do her"" and is not dictated to by what's hot at the moment.  Fans of her music, I believe are fans of true music - I think I'll be listening to Jill's music 5-10 years from now just like I listen to Minnie Ripperton, Phyllis Hyman, Stephanie Mills and Anita Baker.  These women and others that I didn't mention make music to listen to, not music to gyrate in a video to...The reason for the 4.5 rating is because the only song that I relate to but do not like is ""Rasool"" - no doubt we all have a Rasool or two in our lives but the song was a little heavy-handed for me and even after 5+ listens, I still want to skip ove this particular song."
3057959,B001BEK86K,I watched the whole film and now I wonder why I did,"(by John's wife, Julie)I kept waiting to care about the characters in this film but, after wasting the nearly 2 hours it took to get to the end of the story, I found that NONE of the characters had a single redeeming or likable quality and I couldn't have cared less about how any of them ended up.I'll admit that I've never much liked Helen Hunt as an actor but, since I do (usually) like the other leading actors, I didn't but should have followed my better instincts to just shut the film off.What this film shows are 4 different examples of totally messed up adults that never managed to mature.  The ONLY ""grown up"" decision was made by one of the characters at the age of 15.  Beyond that, nothing but emotional cripples.  Sound like your cup of tea?  It sure doesn't come close to mine!I'd recommend you pass on this one.(2 STARS instead of 1 simply because I like watching a couple of the actors.  Probably should have given it only 1 STAR.)"

Ok, I will blame myself for not reading up on this stupid movie before I rented it because I absolutely hate zombie movies of any kind!  But..I didn't anticipate the two main actors involved lowering themselves to a zombie movie either.  Let me say this, I rented the 128 minute version.  It took me 3 days to get thru 46 minutes of the 128 minutes!!  I just kept saying, &#34;OMG! This is so horrible!&#34;, and then turned it off!  Even the parts I forced myself to watch had such poor lighting that it seems like they filmed this in the dark our something.  Maybe they couldn't afford lights, I don't know.  But Brad Pitts last name has taken on a new meaning now.  It falls under movie ratings now...&#34;The Pitts&#34;. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan anyway but give me a break!  Even if I were I would hate this movie.  Like I said I didn't watch it all the way thru because it was literally that bad. I just want to pretend that the main characters were devoured by the zombies and therefore, I will live happily ever after!!!  Please don't tell me otherwise.  It's my fantasy.  Don't bother renting this unless you are a die hard zombie fan because that is all this is about.  I have to stop typing now.  I'm having WWZ flashbacks."

1842309,B000002VHQ,Yet More Tiresome Egocentric Songs From An Ex Percodan Addict!,"The Theme of this album seems to be about ""Growing Old"" which no doubt Ms. Simon can relate to well.In the track ""Have You Seen Me Lately?"" she uses the same old line about ""Falling back on dreams"" which is heard on one of her earlier albums. Don't ask me which one. After awhile they all start to sound the same to me. Perhaps Ms. Simon is running out of original lyrics to write. However as usual, ad infinitum and ad naueaum Ms. Simon sings about How Great She Thinks She Is In Bed with the track ""Better Not Tell Her"". Then of course there is the ironic song ""Waiting At The Gate"" which is about a celebrity getting out of Rehab. No doubt Ms. Simon can relate to this well too. I give this album 5 stars because the cover shows what great work the hair, makeup and camera guys can do to a woman over 50."

2802742,B0009Y25ZU,Funny as in Peculiar,"""Funny Ha Ha"" was not a film which made me laugh.  It made me nervous.  The characters seemed uncomfortable with themselves.  They twitched and reached out toward their desires and then as quickly pulled their hands away.  My favorite character was Jennifer L. Schaper's Rachel who seemed to be a hippie, comfortable with herself and her relationship with Dave.  While she wasn't movie-star gorgeous by any means, she seemed to be the girl next door that you hoped would live nearby.  The low production values of the film make you want to root for it.  But a funny -- not funny as in humorous, but more funny like peculiar -- thing happens about halfway through the movie.  You wonder if anything is ever going to actually happen.  We see Kate Dollenmayer's Marnie plodding through various employment situations and trying on relationships like gloves that don't fit too well.  I was tired; so I fast-forwarded through the rest of the film to see if something happened.  It didn't seem like it, but I decided to return the next day and actually finish watching the movie, just so I could say I'd done it.  I did it.  Why, I don't know.  Filmmaker Andrew Bujalski has a nervous Woody Allen-like style that would be more appealing if he also had a sense of humor.  Christian Rudder as Alex looked like he could be a romantic interest, but then he maybe got married to a girl without having a ceremony.  Myles Paige's Dave drunkenly puts the moves on Marnie in an automobile and then leaves without cashing in.  Kate Dollenmayer won the Best Actress Runner Up Award of the National Society of Film Critics for this in 2005.  I'm not sure what she ran up to, or why they wanted to recognize this.  I didn't find a great artistic statement in this movie.  If you're looking to cheer about this, it's boy gets 16 mm camera, boy shoots movie, boy gets it on DVD and makes a second film.  Nothing in the movie itself grabbed me.  In the end, I wished I rented a different movie.  ""Boring Snore Snore"" would have been a better title.  Taxi."

1813758,B00ATZZWQS,Not a miracle tool,"What to say?  I bought it because a friend has one and he loves it,  leaves it attached to water spigot and stored in a medium sized flower pot.  I'd seen the commercial and online ads, but figured it was all smoke and mirrors.Pros:*  Even though a good portion of reviews indicate weaknesses in the hose, I went ahead and bought one becuase I'd seen it in action.*  It really is light weight.*  It really expands to 50 feet and shrinks back to just several feet.*  Even fully expanded it is smaller than the standard 5/8"" garden water hose, but its flow rate is comparable.*  The female fitting at the spigot doesn't leak and is easier to attach than a standard hose fitting.*  The male fitting for nozzles, etc, doesn't leak.Cons:*  Instructions require the hose be disconnected from the water spigot between uses*  Instructions require the hose be completely emptied of water between uses.*  This is extra work that, if not adhered to, might void the guarantee.For now it's OK - it does what it claims.  How soon will it develop holes?  Maybe never, but based on many reviews, I expect it to eventually happen.  The problem is the lack of repair fittings in the garden/outdoor section of the stores that sell this hose.  So, when it breaks, the whole thing will probably end up in the trash.Because of anticipated problems, I'll try to remember to update this review when the holes start or next spring after a year's use.UPDATE 7/1/14 - It broke today at the faucet end fitting.  The inner material split about two inches and the outer coat also ripped.  I see no way to splice this back into the female fitting, so the money spent on this is a complete waste.  I had hopes I'd be one of the thirty percent that got a good one, but this one broke just three days after the warranty expired.  Go figure."
3683730,B00335U4GO,Good Diaper Cover-Up,"These diaper cover-ups are very good with good design, fit, and security. None of my Yorkies can take them off. However, they are only cover-ups, not diapers, and do not hold much liquid, so make sure you use some sort of liner. And they are NOT waterproof, which is the reason I only gave them 4 stars. They are sized a little small and there is not a huge difference between XS and S so, when in doubt, get the next size up. I will buy again."

The one I got was defective out of the box, and so when I checked, I saw the circuitry did not support pass through.  Maybe it is because I received a defective one, but I still wouldn't try this brand name. I am now stuck saving up for a Full Tone or something."
1659411,B006VXWBTS,"GREAT product, but needs to be a little more SPREADABLE","It is not easy to take out of the jar, much less spread on a piece of bread. I don't think any kid, ar adult with cravings, is going to be patient enough to spread this piece by piece on a slice of bread-- there will be alot of ripped bread slices and short tempers all over the kitchen. PB Crave Peanut Butter, Razzle Dazzle Premium has to be heated in order to partially melt it. This is not what I expect from Peanut Butter, unless I am making a Sundae Topping -- Peanut Butter is a food often used satisfy an immediate craving, and ""Immediate"" has no patience with waiting for the product to heat until it is malleable enough to spread on bread.  Also, the jar I received had a huge 1 inch air gap that went from the top to the bottom -- either from the contents settling while in transit (which I doubt, since the weather from the Vine warehouse to my East Coast home has been pretty cold) or because the factory is also having problems with the spreadability (and viscosity) of their product.HOWEVER, this IS a nice peanut butter. The taste is unusually good -- the combination of a burst  of red raspberry, wild honey, white chocolate and dark chocolate comes off quite well - this peanut butter bursts with flavor bites as you eat it. I dug into the jar (just once per spoon &lt;:-) and ate it with a spoon but since this product is so thiiiick, I didn't enjoy the usual joys of ""rolling the peanut butter on the tongue and in the mouth as a huge smile spreads across your face"" thing.I tried it on hot english muffins -- and it is STELLAR! It MEELTS very nicely and the various flavors really shine here. And melted, it is a great topping for ice cream. I would also suspect this PBCrave would make a DYNAMITE Peanut butter cookie!! I've eaten 3/4 of the jar so I would need to buy a new jar in order to test this hypothesis.Their website, pbcrave dot com has a nice picture of a PB and Banana parfait on its (new, not yet finished) recipes page. It also states that you can spread PB Crave on crackers. Maybe in the summer, and definitely if you heat it first. But not right out of the jar.PB Crave also donates a portion of its proceeds to Project Peanut Butter, whose ""goal is to help save the lives of 2 million children. A minimum of 2% of the profits from every jar of PB Crave peanut butter goes directly to Project Peanut Butter, a non-profit organization focused on treating malnourished children.""PB Crave also has a committment to high standards of manufacturing and quality. Their press release (on their web site) assures the consumer that they are NOT in any way related to the Salmonella problem that plagued some PB manufacturers.SO, PB Crave is a winner, in some ways -- but the PBCrave folks need to add a little more viscosity to their product, and perhaps take out some of those multitudinous (tasty but I think too plentiful) white chocolate chips and substitute some chopped peanuts in their place."
3746368,B000BUQOAE,I use it even if I don't intend to back-flush,"I've come to rely upon this which allows me to see if my tanks have finished draining.  As far as it being a &#34;dual flush&#34; rinser?  It works well.  I don't use it to flush the drain hose however.  I typically drain my grey tanks after the black tank to rinse my drain hose.  In the event I'm at a full hook-up RV site, my grey tanks are open during my stay.  Therefore there is nothing to rinse my drain hose left in the grey tanks.  What I typically do is, shut my grey tank valves, then open my black tank and empty it.  Then I hook up a water hose to this Camco device, shut the gate valve, and fill up my black tank (back flushing).  Then upon releasing the gate valve again, I essentially get a rinse of my drain hose.This works EXACTLY as designed/described.  I've used wands to place into the toilet and rinse out the tank, but who wants to drag a hose into your RV?  Besides, that's messy, smelly and not as effective.P.S.  I have a built in black tank rinsing system on my 5'er.  I use this rinsing system mostly, but about every third use, I employ this with great results and a clean tank!"

3686522,B003AY7GIC,These are the best pads I have found.  Getting ready to buy more.,"I started buying these several years ago.  I did not like the white background with ugly silly prints on them and when you wash those they often never lie flat again.I found the EZwhelp.  I have a little Yorkie and the within the first few weeks of bringing her home I broke my leg and house breaking became an impossible challenge.  She is tiny and I never leave her anywhere unsupervised.  I have these in almost every size.  They look like throw rugs.  I have seen the reviews that say they do not hold up to washing.  I am extremely conscientious about my house cleaing.  These things are washed several times a week  (I put paper ones on each to catch the in between washing piddles).  I wash them twice on long cycles and put them in the dryer.  They are all like new, I can't tell the difference between the newer one and the older ones.They go in crates, pens, in front of doors where she likes to &#34;go&#34; .  I take them with me when I travel with my little Yorkie.  They can be slippery but I am careful and have never one had a problem.  And of course if you use them over a carpet, no problem  I put them at the foot of my bed when I am not well and might not wake up in time to put her down (she is tiny and doesn't jump up or down and is quiet and just waits - doesn't bark)  She had to be on prednisone and had some accidents - and just like another reviewer mentioned, you can put them over your sheets and they protect your bedding and are smooth, so you barely notice they are there.I love these pads!  Try them yourself.  I cannot believe any of the negative comments that have been made about these pads.  They are effective.  Wash well,  Durable.  Not unattractive.  What more can you want?  If you have an indoor dog, are house training a puppy or have an elderly dog, or cat for that matter (I am learning as my 23 year old cat has some stiff days and has trouble getting in and out of litter box, he just uses one of these pads, so now I always have one near his litter box) I don't think you will be disappointed.."
1333348,B000067O0Q,Not That Great of a Game.,"I have owned this game for a few years and thought i would pop it in and try it recently.I remember why i shelved it now.It is a waste of time. The graphics are ok for the age of the game and the general idea behind the game is decent. But the game fails to deliver.Some things i see wrong with it and it is really a combination of  these that makes the single player boring:1)aircraft are difficult to control and more effort than they are worth without a joystick.2)Maps are unbalanced. Playing strictly as one side, they are either to easy or to hard. Some maps are hard to beat even on the easiest setting. And some  you dont even need to play to win even on the hardest setting.3) Ticket point bleeding ( you can reduce your opponents tickets by holding so many control points without ever killing them) is stupid. What really does it for me is the stupid AI. IF you had a decent AI, it wouldnt be as bad.4A) AI is terrible and unbalanced. Your side is stupid. Sometimes they stand around, they use bazookas on infantry, they can barely take a control point without your help and it takes them forever to it. Their accuracy is terrible. And one enemy will keep 1/2 dozen or more busy for over a minute. They are basically cannon fodder that steals all your vehicles and gets them blown up.Increasing cpu time to AI solves the problem to a degree but it also makes the enemy AI a lot more difficult so  it is still unbalanced.4B) The enemy AIs are expert snipers.... with any weapon. I have been perched on a large hill sniping and got hit  from sniping distances with just about every enemy weapon but grenades. Even the enemy planes can pick me off on the first pass with guns. The enemy AI is amazingly accurate even at distance. They are also crafty.  They always know where you are and can always get behind you or sneak pass you and come up from behind and shoot you. They are much better organized and work together to take all the control points. IE: all of your own AI will run to the same control point where they will spend anywhere from a minute to several trying to take it. The enemy AI will  head to different control points in small groups and capture several in quick succession. They will also grenade  your armor in a group and take it out quickly. Whereas your own AI will not do this or manages to get killed before they even get close.5)Scenerios play out to fast. Because of the constant ticket loss( bleeding) from one side or the other that almost always occurs games are short. You may only spend 25-50% of your time fighting. The rest of the time is spent getting to where the fight is and waiting on respawns. It doesnt really let you have a big effect on the outcome of the game. The biggest effect on the game is holding the right amount of control points to cause bleeding( or stop your own). You will spend alot of time running around trying to do this. And as soon as you leave the control point  It will be taken over by the enemy again. Which makes this a completely pointless task.  It would be much better without ticket bleeding. Then it would be based solely on kills to win( winning by attrition)6) A combo of the above really kills the game. And really lowers the replay value. You will probably find single player to be more annoying than fun.7) Bonus: EA even fails at cheats. The godmode cheat for this game reduces your tickets to about 1/4 of  your normal starting tickets.  Since your almost guaranteed to bleed tickets within the first 2-3 minutes it makes for a very short game. It is sad when they even make god mode boring. I always use cheats after i get bored with the normal game  to add some extra spice. EA really failed with this games cheat codes.NOTE: Later Battlefield titles such as Vietnam had improved game mechanics. And some of the problems here dont exist in the later titles. I suggest skipping this title and moving to a later title if you really want to try the battlefield series."
2845420,B000CNER1S,Disappointing,"When I picked up this flick, I expected more and was disappointed that I got more. In essence, the movie is simply too long. It isn't that entertaining to hold attention for the 113 minutes that could easily have been cut down to 90.The start of the film was quite interesting, and the band of marines led by the Rock into a serious level 5 contamination event at a distant lab was good, and the special effects were acceptable.My disappointment drew from the number of scenes that were too dark for the viewer to distinguish anything. In addition, there were periods of fairly exciting action punctuated by lengthy periods of tedium so we could learn more about the interpersonal issues between individuals. Those plot points were poorly presented, and could have been handled more lucidly and without consumption of such large chunks of time squandered.More to my dismay was the manner in which marines conducted their business. For professional warriors, they lacked discipline and tactical coordination. I can only surmise they studied under the George Armstrong Custer philosophy of war. They split their forces into pairs (making them fairly easy to pick off one by one) seemed to be hampered by equipment malfunctions, and were poorly coordinated in what they knew to be a dangerous environment. These marines were not nearly so believable as the marines seen in Aliens, where they behaved much more realistically than these guys!If they had a military adviser on this film, it would surprise me greatly, because their conduct of a combat operation simply was not believable. They didn't even seem to have any idea of phased retreat!The film is an extension of the popular game DOOM, which inspired the shooting spree at Columbine high school in Colorado, according to testimony on record.Before the film was over, I became bored and started looking around for something else to do with my time. That rarely happens in my experience with movies. When I think of watching the film again, it seems more like a chore than an amusement.Such a film that can produce that sort of result is rare indeed."
1784365,B003VCL4XQ,A decent flash light,"I guess most people got this flash light from Costco...3 for $14 (with coupon month).I'll throw in my 2 cents also.It appears that TechLite has modified this flash light.On the previous version, there is a red LED that indicates low battery on the power button.  Well, that has been removed, which is a good thing because I wasn't going to buy this if it has a battery indicator (of course it's going to drain the battery) :)Pro:1.. Solid build.  Not shock resistance, but would stand up to the everyday use.  Throwing against a brick wall would not be a good idea.2.. Water resistant. It could probably survive a monsoon, but I wouldn't go diving with it.3.. It's bright. 100-150 Lumens.4.. No battery status indicator.Con:1.. While I do like the AAA batteries because I can find them almost anywhere, I'm not sure if AAA is the right type of battery for this flash light.On high power, the flash light will last about an hour.On low power, it will last around 4 hours.2.. The power button can be a bit sensitive.3.. The cycle of 3 different settings with a single button can be a bit annoying.  (why is strobe setting there? fast blinking gives me a headache).4.. The craftsmanship is not like the $100 flash lights, but with $5 each, it's decent.Conclusion:It is the best buy for the buck.Overall, it is $5 for each flash light.  If compare with other flash lights at the same price level, this one will certainly out ranks them (I have quite a few from Homedepot).It is a decent flash light that can take the everyday abuse and not afraid of losing it (eg. in the car with the heat which can lead to battery leak or someone stealing it), then this is the flash light.Oh, and avoid the previous version of Techlite, in my opinion."

2376864,B000003KHS,A 5 Star Masterpiece with a 1 star Blu-ray conversion.,"This (and Part II) is my number one favorite movie of all times, it is a Five Star Masterpiece and I watch it at least once or twice a year, enjoying it every time. It is a shame that this great movie got such a poor Blu-ray conversion so this rating goes to the Blu-ray conversion only.I had the VHS set way back then, I still have the Godfather trilogy DVD set which called ""Godfather DVD Collection"" and it is excellent and very enjoyable. So I purchased the Blu-ray version of the Godfather and Godfather Part II and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED(Godfather Part III is an afterthought anyway and does not measure up to the first two).I agree with every negative remarks on this conversion, although the bad film grain only noticeable on a few short cuts and it does not bother me too much but I do not like the excessive contrast throughout the film where all the sunlit outside takes are just plain terrible. All the highlights are completely washed out so this disk for me is a piece of junk. Unfortunately I took the seal and wrapping off from Part II and I cannot send it back to Amazon, so they just will sit on the shelf and collecting dust.If you have the DVD version and purchased the Blu-ray like I did, do yourself a favor and put the DVD in a good upscaling DVD player and the Blu-ray version in the other one, play them at the same time the go back and forth and compare the two like I did. You will not believe how much the DVD version is better. They improved the sound output on the Blu-ray version so not only the front 3 speakers are on most of the time but all five+1, however you have to crank up the volume substantially to hear the voice parts while the other part become way too loud, so I do not like the ""enhanced"" sound output either.If you have the DVD set and are thinking about to buy the Blu-ray versions just hang onto the DVD set which is just as sharp on my Onkyo upscaling DVD player as the Blu-ray with a lot better image quality, contrast and colors.All in all I am VERY DISAPPOINTED and would not recommend wasting your money on the Godfather Blu-ray conversions."
1768815,B002FU6K8E,Old-School Junk,"5 yrs ago this would have been a great light, but LED technology has advanced so quickly this is now just an embarrassment. I compared it to my Planet Bike 1W bike light, which is easily twice as bright, and that is rated at 70 lumens iirc.The beam width focus kinda, sorta works, but is pretty lame. It consists of a clear plastic lens about the size of a pencil eraser that looks like a pregnant thumbtack. Worse, to move it up and down 3 slots had to be cut out of the reflector right next to the LED emitter. Can you say ""leaks light like a sieve""?This brings us to the real problem, the LED is 3 generations out of date. My recently purchased Fenix E05 R2 isn't quite as bright, but has a much more natural color, has a much more even pool of light, and is infinitely more enjoyable to work under than this thing. The Fenix is rated at 27 lumens, BUT, those are ANSI-certified lumens, not mfgs delusional values.Since this light is made in the USA, I don't understand why DuraCell sells this embarrassment. They can just pick up the phone to CREE in North Carolina, and get tons of technical expertise to create a true state-of-the-art flashlight. Doesn't anyone at DuraCell know how to use Google?This is a ""big"" (by LED standards), ugly, clunky, off-color light that shows how far LED technology has come in the last 5 yrs. I would encourage everyone to stop burning batteries, even NiMh batteries, in old flashlights, as the new one's make so much better use of batteries, but this is not a good choice."
1404022,B0012GWGIU,REAL ESTATE FOR  DUMMIES,"MAMBO JUMBO has developed a number of great games (ZUMA springs to mind!). Unfortunately, this one is not one of them...You get to choose the lot, decide on what type of house to built, take or reject the incoming offers. Repeat. For as long as you can take it. Well, I could not take it for long as it got pretty old. Fast.This is an example of what has come to be known as Casual Gaming: small, resource-flexible games that are fun for the whole family. It would not be a bad idea to download the 60-min trial version from a casual games site, such as REFLEXIVE (you can Google it), and decide for yourself whether this is indeed your cup of tea.There are not many Casual RTS games, so I was more than willing to cut BUILD-A-LOT some slack.

Alright, to this point we have covered the only good things about this album.  Unfortunately there is more wrong with it than right.The thing that will grab you immediately is how every song sounds exactly the same.  I'm not joking.  They all start with a bit of jangly guitar and move into this really annoying up tempo beat.  Think Brittney Spears trying to do an unplugged cd.  Each song bleeds into the next and I found myself getting bored very quickly with this cd.  Some songs started cool and then just fell apart under the same annoying beat.  Hannah Montanna would be proud.  But for the rest of us who like real music this isn't just going to cut it.  Do yourself a favor, avoid this one.  And be sad, because here sits tons of potential...squandered."
1318393,B00004Y7SZ,EVERYONE ELSE IS WRONG!!!,"Caveat EmptorLet the buyer beware!Pool of Radiance has been shredded by the masses.  People who don't believe in the death penalty want to kill the people at UBI Soft.  Why?  Well, that is a good question.First off, let me say, this game has some serious issues right out of the box, which, in my belief are the fuel for the fires of irritation which seem to consume most all of the reviewers.  Apparantly, Ubi was in such a hurry to get out this game which has laid dormant for so long, they forgot to do adequate beta testing.  To worsen things, there seems to be some squabble between the producers (Ubi soft) and the developers as to whose fault it is.  Without being privy to that knowledge, the most logical culprit is Ubi soft, since most of the game code was written litteraly years ago.  Besides, one of the quirks was no uninstall program, which is definitely UBI's fault.Anyway the major problems are:  no uninstall, strange problems with corrupted data on the game saves, not enough 3D hardware support, and a crash near the end of the game.  These problems will be addressed by patches, which today 10-23-01, there are two which fix the (1) unistall and the (2) game save corruption.  The third &quot;mega&quot; patch, should fix all the other technical problems folks are whining about, like 3D support mainly, and other errors and bugs.Perhaps, since there are so many bad problems with this first release, they will rerelease the game with all the fixes in there.I hope so.The above bugs are why the game received four stars, and not five.Folks say that PoR has slow battles.  Yes, they are slow.  They are turned based, sort of like playing an RPG with dice, except, they are not THAT slow, and they are not at all boring.  The graphics are fantastic, and the weird stagger of zombies and ghouls and ghasts gives you the creeps--which couldn't happen if they all ran to meet you, or if they just appeared.  The folks that say game play is slow, don't bother to offer any solution as to how a turned based game could have quicker combat.  And, personally, I love combat!  The more time I spend in combat, the more fun I have!  It is tactical turned based combat, like X-Com, which was one of the best games of all time.So, if you think this game is real time, read the box.  It is just turned based.  So, if you hate turned based games, don't buy this game.They say the interface sucks.  Well, I for one, didn't have to read the manual to figure out how to play the game.  That to me says the interface is intuitive, at least for weirdos like me.  If pull down menus annoy you, don't buy this game.  Otherwise, it is pretty much just like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.  The only difference is they have more stupid icons.  Now, is that really that difficult to use?BTW, I am a Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale fanatic!The third edition rules are much better to me than the second edition, because they are more logical.  They are more difficult to understand in a lot of ways (unless your name is Spock), but they add much more dimension to the game.There are some discrepencies between this game and the actual third edition rules, but that is because the rules weren't solidified when they were making the game.  However, the rules they have are fair, balanced, and very interesting.The dungeons are huge!  There are interesting puzzles, interesting bits of D&amp;D lore, traps galore, undead crawling from the cracks, and even undead orcs and lizardfolk!  I mean, there are some very creative situations you will run into down there that add to the feel of a real dungeon crawl.  The fact that they have a dungeon master really really really adds to the aura of those old days of dice and graph paper for those real RPG'rs out there.I mean, sure all this stuff is trite when you come down to it--that's why they call it lore!  But it is the unexpected creativity you see, the interesting stories, and the fun new character system that I really enjoy.  Sort of being immersed in a whole new world of ahhhhh......If you have better than a Voodoo 2 card in your system and the most up to date driver, you shouldn't experience many problems theoretically.  I can only speak for myself--I have run it on my home 1.7gHz Dell with a GeFore 2 Ultra and the new WHQL driver from NVIDIA--the game really runs well on that setup.  Make sure you have the latest WHQL driver on your system, since there is no tweaking program for video.  And if you don't understand the above paragraph, I wouldn't buy the game at all.  At least not until they have more 3d support.So in conclusionDon't buy this game if:-your impatient-you don't have a connection to the internet-you have an old computer with poor specs-you like second edition D&amp;D rules only-you like real time games-you hate pull down menus-you are easily annoyed by crashes and bugsBuy this game-you love the new 3rd edition rules-you love huge dungeons-you love great graphics-you have a nice fairly new graphics card with a new driver-you have decent specs on your home system-you want an immersive world with a rich story line-you know how to download a patch and install it-you are patient-you don't care what others think"

I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO) ...I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ...Bottom line, no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ..."
1720996,B000BQOX88,Perfect replacement for 37 year old timer.,"Our timer quit after 37years.  Amazing that it lasted that long.  As suggested in some of the other reviews, I removed the timer from the new case.  Came out easily as it is held in place by clips.  The new timer had a variety of mounting holes.  One set of holes matched my old timer housing which is held in place by two screws.  The benefit of using the old cabinet/housing is I didn't need to remove the electrical conduits and couplings or disturb the wiring.  I took a photo of the original wiring hook up so I wouldn't forget how I took it apart.  The new timer used different terminals compared to the old one.  But I followed the wiring diagram that came with the new timer and it worked perfectly.. Took me one half an hour.  Also as someone also said it is cheaper to buy the complete new timer and housing from Amazon than just buying the timer without the case.  Hope this helps.."

3613205,B0006L0V6G,"This is a very poor whistle and is in no way ""silent""","The description of this item says that it's a ""silent whistle."" It fails at both.(EDIT: The description of the item changed a few weeks after I bought it. It used to call itself a silent whistle, but not any more.)First of all, in order to make any whistling sound at all, you have to blow very lightly, and the screw has to be more than halfway in. Otherwise the sound is what you get by blowing into a straw. It takes practice to even make a whistling sound from this thing.Secondly, it is not silent. When a whistling sound is achieved, depending on where the screw is and how you blow, it's about 6-8 kHz, which is well within the limits of normal human hearing (up to 15-20 kHz). There is nothing silent about this.You're better off buying a high-pitched human whistle. At least it will work.PS, I used a frequency analyzer and not my ears to determine that this ""whistle"" sucks."
287325,B000ZMGJM6,"Does NOT mix well, very thick","I just started using this casein protein powder, and it mixes incredibly poorly compared to other main protein powders I have had in the past. Compared to the whey proteins I use nowSix Star Pro Nutrition Whey Protein Powderand theEAS 100% Whey Protein Powder, they both mix easily and cleanly with milk, water or rice milk in my shaker and leave virtually no residue. The ""Optimum Nutrition, Gold Standard, Casein Protein Powder"" mixes clunky and leaves a chalk residue, with thick clumps in my shaker bottle that are almost impossible to clean out! I can't believe anyone would say otherwise, this powder ""does not mix easily or cleanly"". I shake 2-3x longer and still its a mess. I am not a fan of the taste either.Update: I switched to mixing 1/2 as much powder and shaking 2x as much compared to the whey protein I use, and that seems to be about right. Perhaps it is just a ""casein"" protein property that it mixes much thicker than whey, so use plenty of liquid. I have gotten used to the taste a bit, but still not great. Upgraded to 2 stars."

1881746,B004K4AUZW,Surprising Results From Gaga,"Of course taking media saturation aside,this is the first time I've actually sat down and listened to a Lady Gaga album. Never honestly paid her much attention. Didn't have to. Personally I feel her one awkward point is similar to that Madonna dealt with at the height of her career. Her whole presentation,creatively and image wise is about non conformity but at the same time the celebrity machine is working overtime in her case. Realizing that this same type of contradiction of approach worked wonders for David Bowie,Michael Jackson,Prince and of course ""Madge"" I'd thought I'd give this one a try. A lot of smart people I know with genuine musical tastes actually spoke quite highly of Lady Gaga. You'd really be amazed how,even in the age of internet just how important the right kind of word of mouth can be. Lady Gaga is,in fact a very self contained artist. A singer/songwriter/producer with a flair for the dramatic and for pure shock value,this quality which could easily deduct points for her creatively actually works very much in her favor. And it will also have an appealing to those,such as myself,looking to explore her music past mere surface value.As pop compositions,all of these songs are actually very strong. Sometimes on songs such as ""Marry The Night"",""Judas"",""Heavy Metal Lover"" and the title song there's all too heavy a late 90'sRay of Lightperiod Madonna influence,in addition to the obvious rave/gay club thud Lady Gaga has made something of a trademark. I guess it's being called electropop. Some of that sameness in production is why I deduct one star in the review. However it all plays wonderfully on the club scene however. On ""Government Hooker"" there's more of a colder Eurodisco flavor to the production. ""Americano"" is one strong number here,incorporating a mixture of tango and Habanero dance rhythms in with the disco dance type music. ""Bloody Mary"" is my favorite on the album,a jam on the funkier side of new wave dealing with that delightfully decedent party scene.  ""Scheibe"" brings the German connection into it,again as with all these songs telling tales of social outsiders who are proudly ""born that way"". On ""Hair"" there's this retro wall of sound via E (as in electronic too lol) Street Band sound,appropriately featuring Clerence Clemons on sax. He's also featured on the more poppy ""The Edge Of Glory"".""Bad Kids"",""Heavy Metal Lover"" and especially ""Electric Chapel"" with it's rock guitar intro have a somewhat cyberpunk edge to them. ""You And I"" is also a fascinating song-kind of a electronic country pop number. It all helps me realize the key to what Lady Gaga is doing with her music here. The filter she looks through is electro rave/dance music. But she brings a lot of the different musical influences that that she embraces into that as well. Musically eclectic artists exists. But they tend to separate their influences out from song to song. Lady Gaga looks into all of her music through that electronic dance filter. Sometimes it's even just outright that. So if your just not too into electronic production,this might not be for you. But for those who chose to hear beyond it to an artists intent,there's really a lot to admire and love about this. During the remainder of the year after this release Lady Gaga has been collaborating on duets with Tony Bennett that show her potential to be expanding her musical filter into another place as well. Listen to these inventive,often cabaret and tin pan alley influenced  compositions even outside the production context it's clear to see that Lady Gaga has more than enough potential to expand and improve on her music as time moves ahead."
1423060,B001NXDBI6,A feature rich keyboard that frustrates more than it satisfies,"So for the most part this is your standard 101 keyboard.NiceThe volume scroller and mute buttonThe button to enable/disable the keyboard lightsEDIT: Figured out what the game mode switch does, and it disabling the windows key is pretty awesome.Not so niceYou have this gigantic keyboard, and the main keys are crammed together. The keys are cramped, much more room on a mac wired keyboard.The keys are loud, very loud.Mine does not lay flat, it wobbles the few different surfaces I've used it on, which causes the right side to be apt to slide during use.The G series keys on the left side are not used at all in WoW, I mean come on isn't that game the reason we bought this.I have no idea what the M buttons on the top left are used for.If you're using this device on a computer that does not have their software installed a very bright logitech logo is displayed the whole time, and using the light on/off button also kills the keys backlighting. Defaulting to a blank screen would be much more helpful guys.The apps are not very helpful.Ventrilo will display the status of the currently connected room, i.e. who's currently talking, but the font is tiny and can't be changed.The wow app is ok, it displays some stats, the scoreboard of the current BG, then a chat window that really does nothing. Where they really missed the boat, there are no notifications that your LFR/LFG for randoms has fired. That's the one thing almost everyone would like to be notified of and it doesn't exist. I know this is probably Blizzard's mistake not Logitech, but there's enough wrong with the very expensive keyboard it warrants the 2 stars without the apps' faults.So it works and its a keyboard, while not a particularly good one.

I'm sorry, but I usually don't leave bad reviews but when I feel I have to I do. Let's get this straight right away, I am a big fan of Incubus and will always be but this album wasn't very good. When I listened to it I only actually enjoyed about half of the cd. Some of it was just boring. Other than that the songs I actually enjoy are Megalomaniac, Agoraphobia, Talk Show on Mute, Here in my Room, A Crow left of the murder, Zee Deveel, and Suite Lines. The rest of the cd just sounds the same and can be annoying at times. If half of the cd has tracks you wanna skip through then thats not good. I'm not saying it was utterly horrible because obviously there are some people out there who really liked it, im just saying I didn't like it. This new album for Incubus just cant compare to my favorite album S.C.I.E.N.C.E. as well as Make Yourself. Both Cd's I thought were amazing. Loved almost every song on them. Morning View is great too. Thats how a Album should be. Sorry Incubus, maybe next time."

175982,B00EV8Y684,Very disappointing by Spigen's standards,"Just received both the Ultra Hybrid and this Neo Hybrid (Gold) today, and I had a rude shock. The Ultra Hybrid has a slight dint in the bottom left corner of the case, which looked like something a made-in-china TPU case would have.As for the Neo Hybrid, the case looked so promising on Amazon's website, but yet was utterly disappointing in real life. Firstly, the polycarbonate rim had multiple slight scratches right out of the box, which looked like it had either been used, or very poor QC was done. Secondly, the buttons are misaligned and so loose they actually popped out when i took off the case to try out the Ultra Hybrid. I have the original LG bumper case for my Nexus 4 and boy, the buttons are miles ahead in terms of rigidity and feel. Thirdly, which is the most shocking part, the process of removing the Neo Hybrid actually opened up the back plate of my Nexus 5! Thankfully, I managed to push the back plate back into the phone.At $19.99, not only does this case comes without a screen protector, unlike the $9.99 Ultra Hybrid, it also feels worse than the cheaper case. Spigen always had a good reputation for churning out quality products, but sadly, they are shooting themselves in the foot by releasing this kind of shoddy work. Search &#34;nexus 5 slim armor&#34; on amazon and you'll know what I mean.Avoid if you can, at least until Spigen rectifies all the problems."

1826338,B000001F4X,The Original But Not their Best,Bon Jovi's self titled debut album contains nine tracks which are all right but with the exception of Runaway do not reach the musical heights of their later albums.  You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80's rather than for the actual songs on here.  This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces.  Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album.  Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start.

1479773,B004PAGJOC,Pretty good 1st try,"I loved this game! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I felt as if I was playing a spin off from the Deadrising series. Combo weapons...really? And they were terrible to assemble. Too many choices. I love the idea of combo weapons from Deadrising, but at least DR makes the combo weapons easy to find and make. I didn't even bother creating any in the Dead Island game. Good plot, good characters and missions, and the graphics were enjoyable. I'm hoping for a sequel with improvements!"
147330,B00B59NKRK,"Works very well, but it adds the weight of a whole other phone to your phone...","I got the Otterbox Armor off of Groupon for $25. Being that it's originally $100 I figured it was a good deal and something I could use whenever I go camping, to the beach, etc. The case itself is extremely easy to install and I had no problems testing it's waterproof ability. The best part about the case is that, unlike other waterproof cases, this one does not muffle sound in the least and does not hinder signal. It works perfectly.My main gripe is that it's just so goddamn heavy. I am not kidding when saying that the case itself weighs about the same as the phone does, put them together and it's like you have a brick in your pocket. For this reason, I don't think this is a good EDC (every day case), but if you can get it cheap it's definitely worth picking up for trips where you are worried about destroying your phone (camping, boating, swimming, construction, etc.)."

I think they were still too big even though they are supposed to be for &#34;women&#34; which I thought meant they would be smaller.

3082014,B001GCUO16,They should have stopped after the first fifteen minutes,"I did not have high hopes for this movie. I knew that for a character with such a murky and tangled backstory that things would have to be simplified for the audience. But I was in no way prepared for it to be caveman stupid. Before I go on I would like to clarify I am writing this, not as a comic fan, but as a film fan.This movie starts very strong with a well done introduction to wolverine, and sabertooth. We are then treated to an incredibly entertaining segment showing wolverine and sabertooth throughout their very long lives in  extremely awesome battles.After that we are introduced to Stryker and his team of bad-asses. They put several generations of ninjas to shame, and then the movie ends. After that the movie shifts to Wolverine: the studio version. Wolverine gets his ass handed to him for the majority of the movie whether it be his first beating from sabertooth, or from the horrible soul searingly ineffective final villan weapon 11(sobs) Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?! Outside of the opening, the action in the movie doesn't hold up well enough to excuse the awful story.I'm sorry, I lost myself for a minute. Why? Well, the studios were able to get Ryan Reynolds to play deadpool, and he nailed the 5 lines that he was given. After that the next time you see him his mouth has been sewn shut. Not only is that poor writing, but we also lose out on hearing what could have been very clever final battle banter.If you like action than you should watch Star trek. If you want an actual story Watchmen should fit quite nicely. If you want a movie that seems to forget what little plot it had half way through the movie, and either kills off or maims the majority of it's most interesting characters than X-Men Origins: Wolverine is the film for you!"

1764105,B001S2RAWA,Bits Break Easily,"I purchased this set for my first router.  Using one of the straight bits I was going through a few feet of hard maple at the proper RPM without forcing the bit.  After a few feet the shank broke in half.  I returned for a full refund and replaced with the  more expensive Freud 13 piece set.  But they work great and don't break. I should have known that router bits are like drill bits ""you get what you pay for"".  I do not recommend the MLCS 8377 15 Piece Router Bit set.Update 8-4-13:  I've done a lot of routing in the last couple of years and my opinion has not changed.  Spend the money for Freud bits - you save in the long run.  Better cuts and durability.  Don't try and get by with cheap bits - you will be disappointed."

When you have a bottle in a leather case with important documents, the last thing you want is water everywhere. The OXO Good Grips Bottle takes away the chance of leaks and spills with its push-in cap (no twisting or arm-strength required). As long as it is pushed in, there will be no leaking whatsoever. The 24 oz. container is adequate for a full work day or long car trip. The cap and bottle are attractive and easily gripped. Stainless steel means it will last longer than reusable plastic bottles. Thankfully, there is no plastic chemical odor like in some reusable bottles. This product is perfectly functional. 5/5 stars."
1841699,B000002TWN,More soul than a sock with a hole,"By 1995, the new jack swing era was history and mainstream R&B; was dominated by glossy productions, calculated harmonies, and hip hop electronica. Chart-toppers even exhibited strong influence from the thriving rap scene, and the seemingly unlikely man to change the tides was a 21-year-old from Richmond, D'Angelo, with his absolutely brilliant debut ""Brown Sugar.""""Brown Sugar"" proved immeasurably influential as the first to explore a sound that would be labeled neo-soul and imitated by many in both the R&B; and hip hop worlds for years to come. Bearing many nods to 1970s-era soul music as well as jazz and blues, D'Angelo manages to execute a gorgeous, nostalgic sound while maintaining a foot in the modern hip hop era as well. Produced, written, and recorded entirely by D'Angelo with a few contributions by legends Raphael Saadiq and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, the album is a masterpiece on all fronts, with beautiful music, wonderful performance, and incredible artistry.To call ""Brown Sugar"" smooth is like calling Jordan a pretty good ballplayer. D'Angelo's ingenious sound relies on slick keyboards, organic percussion, laidback basslines, and often other instrumentation including strings, horns, and pipes. And if the creative music isn't enough, vocally he is fantastic. With a range stretching well into falsetto, his voice moves from a light, airy, angelic quality to a smooth, full-bodied soulful tone. He has a one-of-a-kind voice, but his delivery is equally essential to his sound. In addition to his melodic singing, his delivery is just as often conversational and flowing, lending to a periodic hip hop vibe in light of the rich soul music.At ten tracks, ""Brown Sugar"" is a perfect length and bears incredible consistency. While he effectively explores a wide range of emotions, it never deviates from smooth soul and remains a powerful mood-setter throughout. Beginning with the classic title track, a hit, D'Angelo enters with a hypnotic groove immediately evoking an earlier urban era. D'Angelo uses a clever double entendre to croon simultaneously to a woman and his beloved herb, using language reminiscent of 1970s ballads but a sly humor as well. The hook is gorgeous, his light delivery allows his voice to soar, and this is truly one of the finest singles of the 1990s.After the superb ""Alright,"" an inspiring midtempo jam, and the yearning of ""Jonz in My Bonz,"" ""Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine"" impresses as a melodic love song with great guitar instrumentation. The transition into its follower, ""S..., D..., Motherf....,"" is flawless, barely noticeable until D'Angelo begins to express his surprised rage at discovering infidelity in a relationship. Even with all the raw feeling in this song, the music remains extremely mellow and enjoyable.The intro to ""Smooth"" is fine live jazz on piano, building into an uptempo jazz track. He then covers Smokey Robinson's ""Cruisin'"" with a lush arrangement of strings and soaring vocals. Still my favorite song might be ""When We Get By,"" a catchy, jazzy blues number with a tight horn arrangement, winding bass, and one of D'Angelo's finest performances. This song has a really inspiring feel and great mood. Both closers are absolutely brilliant, the awesome ""Lady"" and the moving ""Higher.""It's amazing that this album is over fifteen years old now, because its currents are still so visible in modern soul and hip hop. Its nostalgia hasn't aged a bit and it still sounds brilliantly fresh and innovative. This is the type of feel-good music that never gets old and can be appreciated by any listener. Ever an artist, D'Angelo has only released one follow-up to date (1999'sVoodoo), and I highly recommend this essential listen to any music fan."
1705258,B0000CCXUA,Can't Do Without Them,"As has been noted by another reviewer, these table extensions for the DeWalt DW735 planer aren't really optional.  The only good reason not to buy them is that you intend to build a full table for the planer.  This isn't a bad idea, since it gives the woodworker the ability to set up some sled jigs for for planning bowed and twisted lumber.  But if you intend to make even a pretense of having a portable planer these are required.  Unless you like snipe.Snipe, if you don't know, is the extra deep cutting that can occur at the ends of the board intil it finds (and keeps its level.  Frankly, all portable (and many stationary) planers snipe.  Even with these tables you will get some, just not as much or as often as without them.  The added stability you get from the tables is often enough to get everything stable before the wood hits the blades instead of four inches later.These extensions are surprisingly stable.  They do fold up out of the way, but there isn't any mechanism to keep them up.  I use a Velcro strap, but heavy-duty industrial rubber bands will do just fine.  I wouldn't wait to discover that you need these in the middle of a battle with 8/4 hard maple.  Buy them when you buy the planer and you won't ever regret it."

Patch cables are crap and the power supply didn't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around.Besides this, I had trouble using it (even for practice) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals.I ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a Gator 'bone' and a seperate power supply.  Easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it's own."

1298975,B000OY4WDI,Bought it - returned it. Still has noise issue similar to prior model AC-2. Also overpriced vs competition.,"SummaryAcoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. I returned it. Price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.Pros- Boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9V power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)Cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- While I have several Boss pedals, I think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.Details:The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. It wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was also just noisy in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. However, I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At the time, the AC-2's were selling for about $85 new. Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3.I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did, a little. But not enough to keep it. I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. I think the AC-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead. They make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. The 400 has reverb on the pedal. I opted for the 300 and got it for $25. I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case. However, this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss....if it breaks...I'll just buy another.I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit. You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3. The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.I'm not saying its a bad pedal, I'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. If they would fix the noise issues, I might have even kept it. I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. This Boss pedal just didn't work that well for me."
1842832,B000002W7R,A classic,"I bought this album in 1972 when John Denver had played one TV guest shot  in the UK. I was 14 and thought it was magical. I still do, 30 years on.  There is not a bad track on the album, but some stand out - the title  track, &quot;My Sweet Lady&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Wooden  Indian&quot;, &quot;Junk&quot; - showing he liked post Beatles stuff too,  and of course &quot;Take Me home Country Roads&quot;. Not as country or  commerical as some of the later outings, this is one hell of an album  defining a great talent. The only drawback is that the digital transfer to  CD is not as good as some RCA have done. Don't let it spoil it for you  though, it's still a superb album."

1687571,B000022316,Buy a Separate Light Stand vs. This One,"Overall, this is an ""ok"" light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the ""up and over"" position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects, and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."

1846260,B0000062HS,An irrestibly groovy album,"Jam metal isn't a genre that one hears much, but if Clutch is any indication, it has some serious potential.  This album boasts an intense power groove that could easily lead to whiplash from excessive head bobbing.  The title track and &quot;Eight Times Over Miss October&quot; stand out especially.  Each song is led by Tim Sult's grinding, stuttering guitars and Neil Fallon's guttural vocal wail.  The rhythm section backs the songs well with booming bass lines and infectious, propulsive drumbeats.  Clutch excel at making heavy music that is also extremely catchy and groovy, with a jam element that is rare in metal.  For fans looking for a band that rocks like no other, Clutch is a good place to start."
1663303,B007OSBE1U,A little weak; pods occasionally 'leak' grounds,"Generally I liked this blend -- it is mild, not at all acidic, and makes a decent tasting cup of coffee, albeit weak coffee -- so if you like a robust morning blend, this is not it.  (It is described as a ""light"" brew, so this is consistent with that description, and I did not deduct stars for that).However, I have had an issue now and then with this pod leaking grounds into my coffee -- I didn't even notice at first that it wasn't an official Keurig pod, just that it says it is ""compatible"" with Keurig.  The first time I had a problem is when I checked the box, because I have NEVER had this happen with actual Keurig-approved (or whatever it's called) coffee pods.It usually is fine, but this occasional nasty last swallow of ground-filled coffee is enough to put me off of it.  It's enough grounds that is it just like it is French brewed coffee (if you're familiar with that).  I also have to clean the Keurig machine out after this happens, or the next cup I brew will also have grounds in it.I do not recommend this coffee for that reason - frankly, it isn't cheap enough to make up for this lack of quality control."

3451104,B008JFUQZ2,When EMPs happen to good movies,"America has not had much success with giant monster movies.  ""King Kong"" is probably our proudest achievement, but it's not really a monster movie in the same vein of the ""Godzilla"" and ""Gamera"" series. The biggest difference is that the genre involves two behemoths battling it out -- so while ""Cloverfield"" demonstrated that a giant monster could be terrifying, it wasn't a legitimate entry into the giant monster genre. Guillermo Del Toro decided to fix that with ""Pacific Rim.""Giant robot battles have been gracing the screen since the ""Transformers"" franchise launched, so it was just a matter of time before someone threw monsters in the mix.  And that's exactly what we get, several arena battles between Jaegers (a name for giant robots that first debuted in theHeavy Gear role-playing game) and Kaiju (the traditional Japanese name for giant monsters).  Awesome, right?Well, yes, if you just want to see impractically-designed and operated giant robots fight blurry monsters in the water.  The battles -- when it occasionally hits land -- is epic.  While it doesn't have quite the same heft of the destruction in ""Man of Steel,"" Kaiju fans will finally get what we've all been waiting for...CGI conflicts between titans that looks awesome on screen.But it's not as fantastic as it could be. The more interesting Jaeger designs are never used to their full potential; what you see in the trailer is pretty much all of it.  The Kaiju are almost impossible to distinguish because they're all gray in the rain, in the ocean, and underwater. Given that the Kaiju come from an interdimensional rift, they seem impractically designed to survive underwater. The Jaegers are no better.  It occurs to exactly nobody that maybe they should design a killer submarine to take on the monsters underwater...in fact, there's not even the slightest hint of any naval military capability whatsoever.SPOILER RIM: And who needs them anyway when you have giant robots? Earth's united forces decide, at what can only be described as a plot gimmick, to just give up on the Jaeger program.  Why?  I was expecting some kind of accidental murder of a bajllion civilians like what we witnessed in ""Man of Steel,"" but instead we get...politics and economics.  Or to put it another way, the same military industrial complex that builds the Jaegers and has success killing them has its funding yanked in favor of a wall that demonstrably doesn't work. Not a single country on our fractious planet dissents.But let's put aside all of that for the moment and focus on the plot. Jaegers are piloted by another staple of the genre, a mind-meld that requires two pilots working in sync known as ""the drift."" It's a pretty cool idea and fun to see on screen, as the two pilots experience each others' dreams and nightmares.  These teams are very close: brothers and sisters, fathers and sons, husbands and wives.  When Raleigh Becket's (Charlie Hunnam) brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) dies during combat, they're still connected and the experience scars Raleigh for life...until he is inevitably lured back into the program as part of a last ditch effort to stop the Kaiju army once and for all before the Jaeger program is cancelled and humanity gives up and dies.But who will be his copilot? Pretty Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is obviously the perfect match -- she's smart, athletic, and capable of keeping up with Raleigh.  And yet leader of the program Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) refuses to let her participate.  When Stacker finally does relent, I was looking forward to Mako kicking some ass and taking names.Instead, we get one of the most offensive female Japanese stereotypes in recent memory.  She pouts, she wells up in tears, and she is a huge liability to the team.  It's clear that women have no place in director Guillermo Del Toro's vision of a robot future that has more to do with brains than brawn -- the women's emotions will just get in the way.  There are several opportunities for Mako to rise above all this, but she never does.  Even though she's standing right beside Raleigh, the plot finds ways to make Mako helpless and ultimately, require rescue.  Sorry girls, you can be a master martial artist with an advanced degree and still not save the world.Putting aside the casual disregard for women, the nonsensical plot that could easily have been fixed, and the attempts at humor that even Ron Perlman can't save, the movie hits a new low when an EMP disables some of the Jaegers and Raleigh Jaeger, the Gipsy Danger, is unaffected.  Why?""They're digital.  The Gipsy Danger is analog.  Nuclear.""I'm sorry, what?  Yes, electronics made in the 1950s were made to withstand the EMP of a nuclear attack and are thus more resistant.  Jaegers didn't exist then.  Even though the Gipsy Danger is ""atomic-powered,"" it has electronics.  And the Kaiiju who fired the EMP apparently knows this, because it never bothers to try its pulse again.  It's a gaping plot hole in a sloppy script that could easily be rectified with a few tweaks.But the robot battles are fun."
2415626,B00003CXMY,Rubbish!,"This strains credibility, even for a lighthearted movie. How so many people enjoyed this frivolous romp through silliness astounds me. Maybe they were all high-that seems likely. Like other comedies from this part of the world that balance drama and comedy, this was just a comedy that over the top. It's just stupid, actually. For good entertainment, try Brassed Off, Intermission, On a Clear Day, Once Upon a Time in the Midlands, The Full Monty, Trainspotting, Or Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels. Hard to believe the two leading characters got involved with this mess."
1574350,B0013L96EQ,Healthy? WHAT? But still tasty,"These are advertised as ""Kids sport chews"", ""for active kids"" and with the slogan ""take a bit out of healthy nutrition!"".Honestly I have to wonder. Upon opening the package, the most obvious thing about these is that the are doused in sugar -- the ingredients list doesn't use that term, oh no, they call it  ""organic evaporated cane juice"". The second ingredient is ""organic tapioca syrup"". Replace that with ""sugar"" and ""corn syrup"" and you get an idea of just what's in these. I cannot believe these are really particularly all that much healthier than gummi bears.That said, however, they do taste good. They have a soft texture, with a mild grape juice flavor....but they are still candy. I give the product a four based on taste and texture alone. They are a bit expensive too. Buy these if you want a quick tasty snack that at least appears to be mostly natural. But if you're looking for something good for you or your kids? Avoid it."

2271985,630382336X,The boys are the thing...,"I know, I know the sound is poor (for the music) and the formatting cropped so that it looks like a picture my kid took - off balance and as if we're missing something just out of sight - but for me the boys are the thing - john, paul, ringo and george - so young, so energetic, so adorable and, so audible and intelligible in this version you have to admit.  If we lost something in the music and it's depth and resonance we gained a lot back in the clean-up of the dialogue.  Personally I can't get enough of these 4 clowns/geniuses/legends and will enjoy them in whatever format I can get them as long as I have breath in my body.  The ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence just slays me to this day no matter how often I watch it.  And George with his  ""I'd be prepared for that eventuality,"" or ""She's a Drag. A well known drag!"" just classic. Not to mention the precedent setting art direction and creative direction in this film.  For anyone that hasn't seen it and is interested in pursuing a career in film or music this movie should be required viewing! It's slick, clean and so hip!"

ID function is useless4. its difficult to remove icons/widgets due to screen in-sensitivity or sensitivity(this is the only reason I rated 4 stars- if this wasn't the case, it would've been 5 stars)I like this phone & would recommend it. These other reviews about touchscreen issues seems to be a bad phone. This is the best phone I ever had. Mine works perfectly. This is the best phone with a keyboard, Boost has. I'm not a fan of touchscreen feature period(old fashsion- like buttons). There's many things you can adjust on this phone. This phone is truly the next generation of the original transform- its actually 3+ times faster & better.

297538,B0013OVUNS,Too similar to Metformin,"I was diagnosed a few years back with pre-diabetes and was put on the drug, Metformin. I happened to be the 1 in 20 who could not handle it. My blood sugars would bottom out and I would be sick for days.  So I did the natural things, changed eating habits, lost weight, started taking vitamins, etc. to keep from becoming diabetic. So I was excited to try this Jarrow Glucose Optimizer. However, I immediately had a very similar reaction to this vitamin as when I was taking Metformin. My stomach cramped, blood sugars dipped, and I was nauseated. Unfortunately for me, this is not a good product."

Unfortunately, it didn't work well in my machine.  The packets are a combination of liquid and a hard packed powder, like those dishwasher packets.  The plastic it was wrapped in, that is supposed to dissolve, was stuck in the front rubber gasket/seal of the door of the washer.  Also, the majority of the powder appeared undissolved, and also stuck in the door seal.  I'm not sure why this happened, and I've never had a problem with powders dissolving in my front loader before.The instructions state to place directly in the drum of the machine for HE washers, which I did."

I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but I'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open.  The lip need to extend down longer, and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around.  If I had a permanent place to mount this, I'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I'll get an extra guitar stand instead.  Good idea, but it doesn't work."

I am no stranger to alternative bread products so did not expect them to taste like a traditional wrap and I use a lot of coconut products and normally love them. The problem with this wrap is not the flavor (strong coconut, somewhat sweet) but the texture. They are almost hard so are nearly impossible to roll up or even fold to &#34;wrap&#34; anything! Maybe my package is old? They are marked MFD10/24/13 and it is now March of 2014. I will try steaming one to see if that helps but if I wanted to do anything more than open a package I would have made my own wrap as I usually do. (there are several good options on Pinterest - search low carb wrap) If you do choose to try them for yourself expect a thin coconutty square wrap reminiscent of the wonton wrappers you get in the refrigerated section near the tofu. And hope yours are more pliable than mine were!"
1295755,B0002F77B8,my forth 12 string in 40 years,"To start with, I didn't buy this guitar because it was cheap, but because of the unbelievable reviews.  I don't know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past I have owned and sold my Gretch 12, my Yamaha 12, my ovation 12, but I won't be selling this one.  I've had it for 3 months now and haven't adjusted anything, only played this $169 12 string from American Musical Supply / amazon.  It is the best playing best sounding 12 string I have ever played period...  This guitar set off a couple of other Epiphone purchases (2, one for my son) AJ220SCE's and ES-339, Also great guitars.  Most of my life Epiphones were dull over coated junk, not anymore, and it seems that Epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them. I own Gibson Studio Les Paul, SG, '87 American Strat, Martin D35, Washburn Rogue, all nice guitars most for a LOT more money. This guitar is a NOBRAINER cannot believe the value.  American Musical Supply is also great, the first AJ220SCE came in with a bad neck and AMS emailed a return FedEx lable in an hour and after I dropped it off and it was logged in at a UPS outlet around the corner I got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way. When it arrived 3 days later it was a good one! :))  5+ star service."

They felt exactly the same in fact. The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch.Packaging error? I have no idea. The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead."

1515597,B009AGXH64,Breaking news : Grown a$$ man buys gaming system,"Alright let me be honest I haven't owned a gaming system since the N64 but I've played pretty much every console since then at some capacity (mostly at friends houses).While I simply bought this console just for Zelda but now a week in I'm absolutely amazed how awesome it is.Some reasons I can't put the game pad down:- Nintendo eShop : You can buy new releases, top notch vintage, and indie games for super cheap. There are specials where you can get games for even cheaper.- Miiverse : Incredible well thought out integrted network for the Wii u and 3ds (coming soon). I'm on twitter, facebook, instagram, google plus and a million others but this honestly matches and/or beats what facebook and google+ do or are trying to do. Seems to be growing fast excited to see where it will go. And with the upcoming 3DS support will add millions of new users and new rivals to compete against.- Game pad tablet thing : At first I was like whuuut daa..is this!? And I think allot of people are in the same boat. There are dozens of reasons I've embraced this tablet controller and actually prefer it now to the classic wii nunchuck. Multitasking support is a big one, it's smooth and intuitive. You can use the wii u game pad as a remote for your TV and other things all while not stopping the game your playing as well as a bunch of other tasks. Off TV game play is top-notch making it easy to not wake the whole house up with Zelda grunts at 3am with my head phones in. Over all it took a minute but I really like the tablet controller for these and many other reasons.-The games are incredible: I'm OCD with research and I entertained maybe getting the new PS or the XBOX. But one visit to metacritic I realized not only does this underdog have more games but better quality games. We can get into pixel density and video card blah blah but who cares how your games look when at there core they are a pile of doodoo on the game play and fun meter. My 5 year old doesn't care about processor speed and neither do I. Also the upcoming releases; super smash bros, Wii U Zelda, and donkey kong country. Also check out all the kickstarters for indie games fundraising to come to wii u they look really good.-You can play old Wii games, use old controllers, and transfer your content-More affordable-Expandable upto 3tb with an external harddrive-Zelda-Zelda-and 3d mario has to be the craziest thing I've played for any system it's mind blowingI think Nintendo just turned me into an adult fan boy. This underdog is a winner in my book."

Don't worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound. If you really want to be able to tweak everything, then get the MXR Analog chorus instead. It has about six knobs. I like the ease of use on this one, and I omly use chorus sparingly. Another cool feature of MXR pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it. It allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot."

I still hoped that I would really like this item.  I think the concept of having  a natural scent diffused via wooden sticks is very interesting.Pros:-This product looks stylish-It does not produce the ash that incense or a candle would-You can control how much scent is released by using fewer XELA sticks-The Vanilla Latte scent is much more subtle than the Mandarin GingerCons:-I want to echo what another reviewer wrote.  I really would like to know what the scent is made up of.  Is it derived purely from plants?  There really is no way to know and I don't like that at all.  If I approved of the source of the scent then my review might go right to 4 stars.-It takes about a full day before the scent begins to diffuse (not really a bad point but something to be aware of)-Heaven help you if the bottle falls over, this oil would be hard to get out of...well pretty much anything-You are supposed to ""flip the XELA sticks"" regularly but I don't know how you'd do that without getting covered in the oil and you WILL smell like a vanilla latte for hours if it gets on yours skin.."

1871108,B0009K7RBG,Webbie!!!!???  ARE YOU EFFIN KIDDING ME!!? ?,"PHEW! *ahem* Excuse me, I can finally catch my breath after laughing so much at this homo!  Now to the review!Ok first we had all those stupid, Lil Wayne, Lil b!tch, Lil sucka, blah blah then the rappers went on and milked the 'Young' name thing to DEATH (Young Jeezy, Young Sleazy, Young pimp mack daddy Young F@g, you get the idea)  but now THIS!!!??? Webbie!?  No way man!  HAHAHAHA!!! I cant friggin' believe the rap industry has sunk this low, and that's really saying something because the current rap scene is the most god-awful, sorry excuse for music in the history of mankind, I hate it even more than emo!Oh and get this, then this kid tries to be all hard with the title of the album being, ""Savage Life"".  I'm only a year older than this c*nt but I guarantee his life aint savage at all.Ok now I'll say something in response to a previous reviewer...Yes I am certainly a 'hater', no doubt about that.  But to assume I'm hatin' because 'I aint got no phat cd' out?  HA! Thats the biggest hunk 'o malarky I've heard all day sweetheart!  In fact I'm thinking about making a cool 'demo' comedy cd  in the near future and show it around to people since I would like to get into the comedy game, perhaps go into improv and such.  It'll feature me ranting and crap about sh*t like this in fact.  If you're into inappropriate, angry, un-pc humor (like South Park) you'll probably like it!Anyway, I'm hating on the mere fact that crap like this is heinous beyond words and needs to cease NOW!  Can anyone say, ""THE APOCALYPSE IS NEAR""??????  Peace out HOMIEEEEEZZZZ!!!"
1862081,B00007FGLS,"Album of the year, 2002?","This fantastic album is one of the best of 2002, and fans of Nas and his incredible music shall not be disappointed. I, myself, have only recently gotten into Nas. It started by hearing &quot;One Mic&quot; on the radio and just snow balled from there. His lyrics are just great and his beats are sure to get your head bobbing and your foot tappin'. Stand outs on the album are (of course) the fantastic &quot;Made You Look&quot; and &quot;Get Down&quot; which samples James Brown's funk classic &quot;The Boss&quot;, from the &quot;Black Caesar&quot; soundtrack. A start-to-finish triumph that should challenge The Roots &quot;Phrenology,&quot; N.E.R.D.'s &quot;In Search Of....&quot; and Audioslaves debut for the best album of 2002. Don't miss out on this masterpiece from hip-hop's best talent and NY's King Of Rap."
301085,B0014LNIPI,One of Nature's goodies!,"I highly recommend these seeds, high in Omega 3, fiber, and protein, they are an all around food.  I put them in soups and salads and, sometimes on sandwiches.  No muss no fuss, not crushing or grinding and they last a long time in storage or just sitting in a baggie on the counter.  Since the will absorb 9 times their weight in liquid, I sometimes add water to them and let them sit to form a jelly like substance to add to sauces.  This mixture will last about two weeks if you refridgerate it."
1563294,B000LKVB52,Great for on the go families,"This product has truly become a time saver for us. There are several reasons that I really like this product. The first is the taste - just a great tasting milk that goes well on its own or with cereal. I also love its long shelf life - for milk anyway. It doesn't have to be refrigerated until opened, but it taste best cold. It is very portable and having its own straw means little to no mess. That makes having a healthy snack for kids on the go something that can actually be accomplished. The price is fair, especially when purchasing through the subscribe and save program. We try to make sure to always have some available and it has saved me a couple of times when I ran out of a gallon of milk."
3292142,B004G6009K,No where near hand drawn titles of the past,"Boy I am a sucker. After hearing this was finally a Disney title that equals past efforts I was shocked to find I had to shut it off after 30mins. Four completely boring songs, generic CG animation and story, characters I just didnt care about. Princess and The Frog steam rolls this 20 times over. Apologists like to the pull nostalgia card but I can honestly say we have back stepped greatly since the days of traditional animation or how they dealt with story and songs."
1299297,B000SJJCX4,For the price?  Pfft.,"Look at this pedal.  Look at what it does, and what it costs.  $30 for a tuner in a pedal form factor, and that's if you don't even try to hunt down a lower price.  By contrast, Boss's TU-2 is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing, and it costs $100 retail.Yes, the housing is made of plastic.  I don't know about you, but I generally won't be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set.  If you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever, it should survive.  And if it doesn't, so what?  It's cheap to replace.The other person on here obviously got a faulty model, which happens.  Mine's developed a touchy input jack over time (it's actually the earlier TU-100 model), but I don't know that it's totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap.  One star off for these kinds of quality control problems, just to be fair.  I own three other Behringer pedals as well, and they're still going strong.A tuner is an essential part of any musician's rig, and this does the job just fine.  Use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playing.UPDATE: After having used a new tuning pedal for some time, I will admit that, yes, this is a subpar tuner.  However, I still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay, this isn't a bad investment.  For a guitarist just starting out, this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound."
1878260,B001CY2EL6,2 stars - So... what's the point?,"I'm a huge Raphael Saadiq fan and I consider him to be one of the few musical geniuses of our generation, but I just simply don't like this album. I don't know. Maybe I'd be more amused with it if it came out a few months... maybe even a month ago. But the whole rebirth of the Motown sound is growing so tired to me now. Solange made an excellent 60's and 70's inspired album, but it was great because it still sounded modern and it had innovative touches that made it interesting. This is just replicating the Motown sound. Period. And quite honestly, what is the point of that and why are people praising Saadiq for this album? I admire him for going to great lengths to make this sound like its release date was sandwiched between a new Supremes record and an early Stevie LP, but at the end of the day this is not pushing music forward, it's only keeping it at a stand-still, if not even pushing it back. If I want to hear a Temptations record or a Supremes cut, I'll go back into my collection and play them. Why do I need this? It's not creative. If a high school art student walked up to his teacher with a paint-by-the-numbers version of Van Gogh's Sunflowers, would he be commended by his instructor? Would it be immediately called a masterpiece? I don't think so. So why is The Way I See It, a basic play-by-the-numbers Motown record, getting glowing reviews from critics? Also, the music on this disc purposely sound flat to bring back nostalgia of the mono versions of Motown. But even the Motown classics have been remastered to stereo quality long ago. I did actually enjoy the introspective ""Sometimes,"" ""Love That Girl,"" and ""100 Yard Dash"" before it was awkwardly faded out at two minutes and eighteen seconds. (Haha... get it? That's what used to happen on the old 45's. The song used to fade out really quickly. Eh? D'ya remember? Well I do).  Anyways, I really wouldn't recommend this album, but it seems to have plenty of fans. All I know is that after only one listen, this is getting buried by all the other wonderful albums that have come out lately."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I did like this full-flavored coffee.  Mind you this can is only 6.8 fluid ounces, but it's like an espresso ... you don't need very much to satisfy a craving.  If you don't care for your coffee sans cream and sweetener, you either pass or add them to it.  In order to get the full flavor, I tried it as is.  I enjoy decaf espresso and this one with 152 mg of caffeine packs a wallop.  I think you do have to love espresso to appreciate the taste.  I drank a lot of espresso in France and illy issimo caff&eacute; has that taste I come to expect in a good espresso.INGREDIENTS:Arabica coffee, potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrateNUTRITION FACTS:Serving Size:  1 CanAmount Per Serving:Calories  5Total Fat  0gSodium  20mgTotal Carb  1 gFiber less than 1gSugarProtein 1 gCaffeine  152 mgOne other thing I like about this coffee is that ""The Ethisphere Institute named illycaff&eacute; on its World's Most Ethical (""WME"") Companies 2013 list, recognizing the company's achievement in maintaining the highest standards in corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and sustainability policy.""

1476380,B004HYK8Y8,"Vast game with flaws.  Skip PS3 on this one, though","I am admittedly late to the Skyrim party, having just tried it a month ago.  This review is primarily aimed towards those who primarily game on consoles (PS3/XBOX360).  First, my quick opinion on the game itself:Overall, this game is quite amazing.  The world they've constructed is impressively detailed, and sometimes I just can't believe the sheer size and scope of the content.  From that perspective, I think this game is a remarkable achievement.  I am almost 100 hours in, and I have done very little of the main story.  That is impressive, and makes the game a rare value.  Unfortunately, there are some big time flaws as well.  Show-stopping errors and glitches abound (detailed in other reviews).  Many have been fixed, but some things have not been addressed (especially with the consoles).  Also, the actual fighting leaves a lot to be desired.  In my opinion, it's decent, but other games provide deeper and more satisfying combat (see Dragon's Dogma, Dark Souls, etc.).  But, the world is huge and complex, and very easy to get lost in.  Really, I've never experienced Skyrim's equal in terms of a ""sandbox"" type game.Now, for the system considerations.  I started playing Skyrim on PS3 (about 30 hours), as I do with almost all games.  If you are also playing this on the PS3, you owe it to yourself to stop and get this on a PC.  Seriously.I do not have what would be considered a ""gaming"" machine.  It's a couple of years old, has a mid-tier graphics card, dual core processor, I think 4GBs of RAM.  Not a powerhouse by any means, but the experience is vastly superior to the PS3 with this game.  The load times were killing me on the PS3, and have pretty much been eliminated on the PC (medium graphic settings).  Another great benefit is the ability to employ unofficial patches, created by the gaming community, that fix some issues that Bethesda hasn't.  Plus, fan created content can be explored, which isn't possible on consoles.I am a console dude at heart, and wasn't willing to play this with a mouse and keyboard.  Fortunately, gamepads can be used with the Skyrim on the PC.  First, I tried my PS3 controller, plugged in the USB port, but there were some issues.  You must download a program called ""MotionJoy"" to get it to work, which is clunky and comes with Adware.  Finally, I just ordered an XBOX360 controller, which is a far simpler solution.  It's plug and play with PCs, and works great.--------TL;DR - Deep, vast game on a level I have never experienced.  But, there are flaws (errors, glitches, uninspired combat system).  Also, the PS3 version is SIGNIFICANTLY inferior to the PC version (this coming from a console gamer)."

310703,B0019ZGU1S,Another great Sonicare brush,"I had my old Sonicare Elite model for more than seven years, which is insane. The only reason I decided to upgrade was because the replacement brush heads for the Elite series cost so much more than the newer model brush heads, so I figured I'd actually save money this way. I also liked the new design and whitening feature of this Sonicare brush. So far I am very impressed by it. The new brush heads are great. Not only are they cheaper, but they also attach to the brush differently than the old ones, so you don't get that buildup of gunk under the brush head that's so hard to clean. Also, I think the whitening feature actually works, which is awesome.The product does not come with a separate travel charger as advertised. Instead, the main charger comes apart so you can use a more compact version when traveling. I don't have a problem with that, but it should be more clearly advertised. Along the same lines, another reviewer mentioned that it's easy to knock the brush off the charger. I agree with that statement. The base of this charger is different from the old one, and it doesn't hold the brush as securely in place. However, I prefer to charge my toothbrush once a week and keep the base/charger off the counter altogether, so this really isn't an issue for me either. This brush comes with two different size brush heads. The smaller one is supposed to be for cleaning your molars. However, I don't think I'll ever realistically use the smaller brush head because I won't want to keep changing the brushes back in forth. Some people might dig it, though.Overall, I am very happy with this product. It is the same high quality product I have come to expect from Sonicare."

1695894,B00004SUQ8,Not so great,"I was surprised to find that, unlike other buffers, the pad oscillates but is not really attached to the motor shaft, so any heavy polishing causes the pad to stop spinning.  The motor does not sound good when it runs, it has a cheap Chinese product sound.  It starts with a jolt spraying the compound everywhere.  Speed control at it's lowest setting is still much to fast.  Crummy pad supplied cannot be removed from the backing pad.OK for light polishing but the polishers with slow-start and slower speeds are a better choice."

3646366,B000YDQ90I,A good deal,"The Aqueon Medium filter cartridges sold on Amazon are much cheaper than buying within a big box pet store.  They last approximately 3 weeks to one month as stated on the packaging and keep my 20 gallon planted tropical aquarium crystal clear.  When replacing your filters on the Aqueon pumps, be sure not to clean the blue cartridge housing as this can take away from the bacteria that is essential to your tank's ecosystem."
362028,B002GU6AQK,Very tasty treat!,"These bars from Slimfast I was half expecting to taste like wood. I was rather surprised by the flavor. They're actually rather good. I like caramel and chocolate so this was a good combination. The peanuts were of good quality too. I've had some snack bars where the peanuts were old and nasty and it was not so with this bar. It's like a rice crispie treat. As far as weight loss plans go, it would be too soon to tell if staying on SlimFast's recommended diet plan would work. I'd have to stick with it for at least a month. However, just a warning since many of us are used to big portions. These bars are rather small and probably the snack portion we should be eating. In the US however, we're used to big sizes, so if you're expecting a large sized snack bar with few calories, do not kid yourself.These bars get a bit melty which is something to watch out for. Perhaps a bit of a warning of ""store in a cool dry place"" would help. Otherwise, you an expect half of your toppings to be stuck to the packaging."

2537136,B00005JPH2,A million times better than the first film,"I still remember all the hype surrounding the first Chronicles of Narnia films,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition), and for all that hype, for all that attention it received (due mainly to the success of The Lord of the Rings films) it ended up being nothing more then a kiddy version of Peter Jackson's epic masterpiece, Lord of the Rings, for kids as it were. I never understood the hype about the first Narnia movie; it really wasn't anything more than a 3 star film, hardly worth gushing over. Not Prince Caspian though, the second installment of films based on C.S. Lewis's classic booksThe Chronicles of Narnia.1,300 years have passed since the kings and queens of Narnia, Peter the High King, Lucy, Susan and Edmund left Narnia. In the time since, a race of men called the Telmarins have invaded the peaceful nation of Narnia and driven the magical inhabitants, the talking beasts, the dwarfs, centaurs, minotaur's, griffins, everything into hiding, fearing for their lives. Prince Caspian is the rightful heir to the thrown of Telmar but his scheming uncle Miraz has just had a son, a son he hopes will someday become king. In order to make this happen, however, he must first get rid of the rightful king, which sets off a chain of events eventually leading to an uprising of the Narnian people against the savage rule of the Telmarin rulers.Prince Caspian is a magical film which is, in every way, the previous films' better. Beautiful landscaping is so common in epic fantasies like this that it's almost a clich&eacute; but here it doesn't seem like a mere LOTR copy like so many others.  It's landscaping is neatly done, playing up the differences between Lewis's fantasy world and Tolkien's. The ruins of Cair Paravel, the beaches, Aslan's Howl, are all wonderfully realized. The story begins when our four kings and queens of old are summoned to Narnia, when Caspian blows Susan's horn. They are transported to their former dwelling, the castle Cair Paravel, only to find it in ruins and decay. Meeting up with a dwarf they rescue from death, they make their way across the wilderness of Narnia to meet Caspian.The power struggle between Caspian and ""High King"" Peter gives this movie great tension early on. Caspian is somewhat unsure of himself, having never led men into battle, and allows his will to be overturned by strong opponents. While Peter, by contrast, seems is too sure of himself because of his former status as ""High King"" and often times refuses to take the advice of others, namely Lucy, whom as testified to in the previous film should always be believed. Peter also refuses to heed Caspian, who's command Peter tries to usurp out of pure spite and pride. It destroys the moral of their soldiers to see their leaders do nothing but bicker and for a while this is all that these two ""wannabe"" kings accomplish.But the show stealer for this film is not the kings, the centaurs, the giant castles or even Aslan the lion but Reepicheep, a buccaneer like mouse who refuses to let his tiny little size get in the way of glory, honor and pride. Running through the ranks of Telmar soldiers he cuts them off at the knees, asks them for their final words and when they mention the obvious, ""Your a mouse"" he frustratingly replies, ""oh, you humans have no imagination."" There are few characters in any movie that are as fun to watch as Reepicheep, his antics and overly prideful sense of himself, despite his size is, as Lucy says, ""so cute,"" but don't say that in front of him. I cannot wait to see him back in the next film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Combine all this with some amazing choreographed fight scenes and this is one amazing film.The only fault I can find in Caspian, if you can call it a fault, is that it comes AFTER The Lord of the Rings. So many plot elements have already been used in LOTR, unfortunately. So although I don't want to penalize this film for that, it does come up repeatedly. Peter and Caspian reaching for power like Boromir reaching for the ring, Susan pulling off her best Legolas impression, the water figure washing away the Telmar horses as they try to cross the river. Yes, it's true to the book for the most part, but it did seem very ringish in many parts.Prince Caspian is not going to be the best film of the year when all is said and done, but it does stand a high chance of standing up there with the best films of 2008. Although it does hold a lot of LOTR elements, I can't really fault it for that since LOTR pretty much did everything, and did everything well. I can only hold my breath for when the much awaited film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader comes out. I will  be waiting for this, The Silver Chair, and possibly The Last Battle.Replay value; High."

2928403,B000M341Q4,A parody too close to reality?!,"To add my thoughts to the other reviews.I enjoyed parts of this film, but think that prior works of this group are better.IMO, the greatest weakness of this film is that it is a parody which resembles reality too closely.Is reality funny or silly / stupid?My  greatest pleasure was seeing these many actors and actresses who I know from other prior films from this group.I enjoyed the directors comments.  I have the impression that the directors and producers enjoyed it perhaps more than I.I am a little surprised that the technical quality is not better, OK, but for a modernly made film by a group of this caliber, expected better.I have thought about the question of why this film did not appeal more to me.Perhaps the directors could not decide if they were making a light drama, a satire, or a farce.Can a film be all 3?IMO, too much a drama.  IMO, interesting to watch (with DVD controller in hand)."
1526396,B00CMQTVUA,Inferior to 360 thus far and lots of small issues.,"I wish I hadn't bought this behemoth at this point.  The voice recoginition is a joke.  I use Fluency to dictate at work and microsoft's voice recognition is so inferior it is laughable.  One of the few games I have, Dead Rising 3, was constantly crashing when I played it.  After searching forums/blogs, I found out that it probably was because I played the game while it was still loading (which by the way took FOREVER).  So I had to delete the game, lost my save data, and then install the game, install the update for the game (also huge) and then I could play it without crashing.  Plus, my biggest annoyance is that I thought that the xbox one was supposed to be better about not having you watching downloading and installing bars cross the screen.  Now granted I don't play it a lot.  I'm a busy physician and there aren't good games.  But everytime I turn the thing on it makes me download some enormous update and then install it.  Or when you put a new game in you have to wait for it to load (obviously all the way based on my Dead rising experience).  When you only have an hour to play before bed after you get the kids down and you spend half of it doing these updates or loading a game, it's pretty disappointing.  Also, the thing is just glitchy.  I've had issues with the controller and the unit having communication issues with each other which never happened with my 360 and you can tell the controller has thinner, flimsier plastic than the 360 controllers which would be fine if it were cheaper. Plus I no longer run my DirecTV through the xbox one which was supposed to be some wonderful function because it has a much less user friendly menu when you do this, it made our DVR mess up where it would take 2 or 3 seconds before it would fast forward with the 30 second skip and when you hit that button 6 times during a commercial break it's pretty annoying to have 12 or 15 seconds of just wasted time, and worst of all it CLEARLY made our picture worse on our TV.  I took the HDMI cable and plugged it straight into the TV from the DVR and then through the Xbox One into the TV and there was clearly a less crisp, duller, washed out picture.  It wasn't even tough to see the difference.  My wife clearly noticed it and that isn't something she even claims to care about.  And now Microsoft slaps me in the face and the Kinect that I just had to have as an initial buyer because it was ""so integral to the Xbox One and it's future"" is not not necessary at all and in fact I got to pay $100 for the privelege of having something that was even slowing my GPU down by 10% potentially making the graphics worse according to an article I just read.  All I can say is next time Microsoft makes a console, I will absolutely NOT make the mistake of being an early adopter.  Lesson Learned.  Wow, I sound so angry.  Believe me, you don't spend $500 and not want to like something but MS just failed on a lot of levels to deliver here."
1874801,B000IFRQAY,Total garbage.,"All it took was one listen to realize what sheer waste this album is. Do yourselves a favor and hear how it's supposed to be done by checking out ""Arular"" by MIA, who this talentless tart is desperately trying to ape. Every song's vocals are digitally multi-tracked in order to disguise LS's lack of talent. The entire album is annoying. There's nothing good on it, in fact, I can hardly remember what the hell I just listened to - and that's a good thing. Thank god I didn't pay to listen to it, for if I had, the cd would now be laying in the trash compactor shattered into a thousand little, worthless pieces."
1840245,B000002OJ4,Almost The Worst,"Well this album is usually regarded, with the exception of &quot;Victim Of Love&quot;, as Elton's weakest effort. For the most part, I agree, but even though most of the material is faceless, I feel there still is some decent pop music here. &quot;Heartache All Over The World&quot; was the single, and while it failed to crack the top 40, it still was somewhat catchy, I'd love to see the video for it. Like many other reviwers have said, &quot;Paris&quot; and &quot;Hoop Of Fire&quot; are decent, &quot;Go It Alone&quot;, a song somewhat similiar to &quot;Act Of War&quot;(minus Millie Jackson) keeps things going in the right direction, while &quot;I Fall Apart&quot; sounds as though it could be a lost cut from &quot;Blue Moves&quot; or could be included on the future &quot;Big Picture&quot;. Okay, so there are about five decent songs, the rest is pretty much filler, but still makes for decent background noise, still, this album cannot be viewed any worse than the likes of &quot;Ice On Fire&quot;. The thing is, Elton could do so much better, and he eventually did with &quot;Sleeping With The Past&quot;."

2629422,B00008K2XP,Great DVD To Own!,"The reason I rated this 4 stars is because it wasn't as good as Season 3, but it was still pretty good. I loved the relationship between Xander and Anya as well as Buffy and Riley. It kept the story going. It's great that Spike returned back in this most of the season instead of just one episode during the middle of the season like in Season 3. I seemed to really connect with Alyson Hannigon (Willow) the most in this one because her break-up with Oz was really sad, but when she meets Tara from a group-witch type meeting. Things start to look up for Willow, she starts getting real feelings for her and I really liked the chemistry between them too. I like Oz don't get me wrong, but I like the relationship between Tara and Willow(they are both real witches what more could you want)more. The main story is that Buffy finds a new crush which was Parker, but he's just a guy that got in her pants and left her. Then Riley comes along and Buffy begins to start a relationship. Even though Buffy has know idea Riley is in The Inniative a army group with Professor Walsh that captures demons and performs experiments on them, supposedly implants chips in them so they can't harm humans. As Buffy soon finds out that Riley is in the Inniative she starts to wander that there is more stuff she needs to know like a dangerous experiment in Room 314. Adam, one of Professor Walsh's experiment winds up killing her(Professor Walsh). Buffy starts to have a really hard time trying to go through her relationship with Riley because his army gang are always giving her a hard time. Buffy must battle Adam and she does when Willow, Xander, and Giles come together to perform a spell on Buffy to destroy him. As that's done Riley soon removes the chip Professor Walsh implanted in Riley during the beginning of the Inniative so no more weird outburst from him. And Buffy soon goes through a weird dream after battling Adam with the cheese man and comes face to face with the first ever slayer!Sorry I spoiled most of the season, check it out though it's really good!"
75167,B0073F92OK,Excellent mobile juice pack,"This is a heavy duty version of the 5200mAh juice pack, which I have reviewed in detail on Amazon. Rather than repeat all of the features that I described that both units have in common, let me focus on what makes this product different.1. This is larger and measures 3 3/4"" x 2 3/8"" x 3/4"". However, this is not bulky and more than compact enough to bring when you travel.2. This has two output ports: .6A and 2A. The 2A is great for charging an iPad. I charged an iPad from 80% to 100% in the same time it takes when plugged into an AC outlet, and I barely made a dent in this unit's power supply.3. The 5200 has a large power button on the top that makes it easy to operate the flashlight. This unit has a much smaller power button located to the right of the micro USB, but it's still pretty easy to use.Bottom line: This is a good unit for regular charging of an iPad, and also where you need a longer power supply than what is provided by the 5200. Except for the differences I mentioned, both units work the same, come with the same cables and adaptors, and are effective.Disclosure: The manufacturer sent me this product to review."
1578902,B001BM395E,Normally love Earths Best,I usually feed Earth's Best baby food to my grandson. He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for breakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I don't know which one caused it but I don't want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know.

1814253,B00B3SG6QA,Good Basic Iron At A Good Price,"Weller soldering irons have been around forever, and I've been using one for almost as long.  It's getting a bit long in the tooth, so I'm happy to have gotten this one.  The SP25NKUS is a modern version of Weller's basic iron with the added feature of 3 LEDs in front for illuminating your work.  These LEDs are no substitute for adequate lighting, but do spotlight your work, making it a little easier.  The soft and comfortable grip has a triangular front end that prevents the iron from rolling about if you're not using the included (cheap, thin aluminum) stand. The power cord is about five feet long, with an effective strain relief. This tool is built to last, and carries a seven-year warranty to prove it.The SP25NKUS is Weller's Standard Duty 25 Watt iron, reaching a temperature of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit.  I tested it on a couple of small electronics projects using the large chisel tip. (Two other tips of two different types are also included, and, yes, older Weller tips will fit on this iron.)  This iron heats up quickly and gets more than hot enough to effectively solder wires to the backs of potentiometers, so it will do anything else I need it to do with ease.  Professionals will want to opt for an industrial-grade setup, but for occasional users such as myself, the Weller is quite satisfactory.  I do wish that it came with some sort of case, but that's no big deal. Prices vary on these, so be sure to keep that in mind if you're in the market for one.  Recommended!"
422041,B004H44GB4,Try a different unit,"My physician recommended that since I am now over 40, it might be a good idea for me to start monitoring my blood pressure levels.  I recieved the Omron BP791IT 10+ Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and it really did not fit what I had in mind.  The case itself is constructed of a rather flimsy plastic. The cuff was really rather cumbersome to use. It also was recommended by a close friend to get Microsoft's Health Vault as it would usually work well with Omron's units. Not so with this one. No matter what I did, I could not get the unit to talk to my computer and the software so it really was not of much use to me.  To say that I was dissatisfied is an understatement.  The BP791IT just did not work for me at all.  I have since gone with another Omron unit."

The box says it all:-No high fructose corn syrup-No hydrogenated oils-No preservatives-No artificial flavors-No trans fatsWe've bought these at Costco for a comparable price to Amazon! My daughter begs me to get her these for her school lunches. It is true that they all are primarily made from apple juice and puree, but that doesn't deter me. It's hard to find snacks that feel like a treat for my daughter. Many kids in her class have neon fruit snacks, Cheetos, Oreos and snacks like that. I always pack her organic snacks that don't seem as cool. So, for her to be excited about this makes me happy! The rope look of it is cool and makes it more fun to eat over a fruit leather. These are one of my favorite snacks also. When I have a candy craving I satisfy it with one of these 70 calorie snacks."

This was not a documentary, it was a propaganda piece.  If you eat 5000 calories of any food, you're bound to have negative effects.  Why pick on McDonald's?  There's enough junk fast food places that share the blame.  My biggest complaint is where they show him vomiting and becoming delirious.  First of all, you gulp down 40oz of a sugary drink on top of two Big Macs, vomiting is a foregone conclusion.  Second, you wouldn't become delirious due to food, unless the food was tainted and you developed sepsis or a fever, or you have diabetes and or hyperglycemia.  Otherwise, it was all acting on the part of the movie maker.  This movie is a bigger load then the one I lay in the toilet after eating 20 piece chicken nuggets.

2106131,6300216047,A Sci-Fi Classic and Jane's Defining Role! Needs a Special Edition DVD!,"""Barbarella"" next to ""Cat Ballou"" has to be Jane Fonda's signature film. What's amazing about both of those movies is that Fonda is playing the same role as the boot-wearing, gun-loaded, desperado heroine (even though they're in different genres) and they may be the two deepest roles that she's ever played. Looking through the still photos to this film Fonda's performance is almost like Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"": It was a lightingbolt of a role that cascades on not only the movies, but pop culture in the late-60's. I agree with Jeff from Portland: The picture on the DVD is great and I believe this film needs to be re-released and be loaded with special features. There are two things I take notice on this: How great it looks (for which I have gone over) and the costumes. Out of all the costumes that Fonda wears the one that I'm floored by is the one where she wears a white unitard with breastplated armor and a black cloak wrapped at the back, a red utility breif belt, and black boots with the red stripe down the middle (not only that but it came with red fold-down crowns on the top of the boots; creating a stirup look like you would see on a baseball uniform). Seriously, should that unitard be in leather and not in cotton/spandex? Given the fact that it would be torn up in the scene between Fonda and the birds. On a personal note, I'm getting sick of hearing most of these reviewers here still badmouthing Fonda for what she did against Vietman. Those people should get a life (not to mention a brain) and realize that Muhammad Ali did the same thing and he almost went to jail and couldn't fight for two years while Fonda was no where near there. Where's the outrage in that? Anyway, back to the movie. I think it deserves to be a sci-fi classic while it has to come out as a Special Edition DVD. I know because I think the trailer to this film made me breathless."

3104514,B001MYIXAC,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I saw all the rave reviews of this movie and so I didn't bother to rent it first...I went out and bought it.What a let down!  All the hype had me anticipating something fresh, new, and original.  NOT.This is a typical vampire story about a young girl who needs a human (kind of like the relationship between Dracula and Renfield).  Her adult human helper is so stupid and inadequate that one wonders if this was supposed to be a comedy.Alas, it is supposed to be a serious movie.When her adult human helper dies (no surprise here), the little girl befriends the boy next door (literally).Nothing new here.  Everything is predictible.  Sometimes the badness of the movie made me wince.Now on to the English dubbing.  It is badly read and very wooden.  So I changed to the original language using English subtitles.  Much better.Still, no subtitles can save this movie.If you are such a vampire buff that you want every single vampire movie ever made, buy Let the Right One In.Otherwise, steer clear.  This movie has been done before (again and again), and there is nothing special about it.  Rent it if you have to, then move on."

At different times, I would get a sort of flare on the screen that would block out half of the action and effectively render that particular game over or unplayable. As a result, I have only played this game a couple of times, which hurts given the expense. I have tried looking for patches but frankly I resent having to spend so much time trying to effectively repair something that should have worked out of the box. This game looks promising with all of the new equipment but if it's not going to work smoothly, then it might as well be junk. Unfortunately, I don't have a nephew to give it away to."

2573646,B00005V4XE,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Castle thrillers; my rating doesn't reflect the movie itself. The problem is that the DVD release is presented in full screen rather than widescreen and no--that's not the original aspect ratio. The package clearly states that the contents have been ""reformatted to fit 'my' TV."" The Tingler (DVD release: 1999) and Mr. Sardonicus (DVD release: 2002), which are also Columbia releases, are presented correctly in 1.85:1 (although I don't think they're anamorphic). Amazon's description lists the 1.33:1 ratio, but I didn't notice it, to be honest. However, this is going back unopened as I find pan-and-scan unacceptable. I can't imagine how Columbia managed to screw up on this one because the other two titles are as they should be.Incidentally, the movie is great fun and is my favorite of all the Castle titles. I don't know whether I'll ever get to own it on disk in its proper aspect ratio because, let's face it, this isn't a significant title in the overall scheme of things. Sad. I can only hope..."

Use a conditioner on this brush for the same reason you use one for your hair.Many people don't seem to understand the difference between a cream and a soap.

406320,B003WR3QSG,"Good brush, all in all","The bristles on this brush are pretty soft, but I have an older brush from Tweezerman that is, I think, a little bit softer and holds it shape just as well as this one. I found the varnish on this brush to be way too slick, and had trouble hanging onto it with soapy hands, and so I went through all the trouble to remove the finish right down to the wood, and then, while I was at it, I used a high-speed rotary tool and appropriate burrs to create a random pattern of shallow holes with sharp edges at the surface of the wood (so as to provide a good gripping surface when the handle was slippery with soap). This worked out well, and now there's no problem at all with grip. Also, I installed a powerful disc magnet in the bottom of the handle and now hang it tip-down from a little cubby that's set into the wall beside my bathroom sink. The's no problem after a month or so of use with loss of hairs from the brush&#8211;&#8211;a few came out over the days, but that has ceased.

2560271,B00005QAP6,The Ticker For This Movie Was Up Before It Was Even Released,"&#34;Ticker&#34; was Steven Seagal's second Direct-To-Video movie, after 1998's &#34;The Patriot&#34; (not to be confused at all with Roland Emmerich's much, much better 2000 film of the same name).  Yes, Seagal's &#34;Patriot&#34; was on the ridiculous side, but at least it tried to go in a different direction and be a little bit deeper than his usual stuff.  In the end, it actually wasn't half bad and probably only got a DTV release because Seagal's movie contract had ended and his box office returns were diminishing.&#34;Ticker,&#34; on the other hand, is an absolute atrocity in every way possible.  This movie had a total budget of only $7 million, a total shooting schedule of just two weeks, and a director who had made a boatload of crappy DTV movies in the past.  This film was doomed before it was even filmed.  I actually am very glad this did not get a theatrical release, as this movie had no right to be in any movie theater anywhere.  There is not a single redeeming aspect of this movie to be found anywhere.The acting completely sucks.  Tom Sizemore, Steven Seagal, Jamie Pressley, and Nas just phone in their performances with no life or enthusiasm whatsoever.  The one bright spot was Dennis Hopper as an IRA bomber, who sports an Irish accent that is either completely absent or incomprehensively exaggerated.  It had me just laughing so hard I couldn't breathe.  Seagal even recited Zen nonsense while Sizemore was trying to disarm a massive bomb that could wipe out an entire city!The plot is not even worth mentioning.  Dennis Hopper is a bomber who wants to blow up San Francisco, and his girlfriend is an accomplice.  Eventually, she kills him and reveals in some worthless twist that she was the true mastermind all along.The direction, courtesy of Albert Puyn, is extremely lazy and sloppy.  The movie was actually filmed in Los Angeles, but just inserts random stock footage of notorious San Francisco landmarks, like Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and trolley streetcars.  The interior and exterior shots of locations were filmed in entirely different locations from each other, and it's blatantly obvious.  The editing is a complete joke, as no logical progression or sense of cohesion is present at all.  It's just a bunch of random scenes that end up going nowhere.So, the direction, plot, and editing are worthless, but can the action make it at least a guilty pleasure?  Hell no!  The action scenes in Ticker are a complete and total abomination.  Steven Seagal was actually not present for the filming of these scenes, so they attempted to compensate by using body doubles and actually filming Seagal at a later time.  The fight scenes are stuffed to the brim with rapid-fire quick-cutting and endless shaky-cam, and filmed in murky darkness to try and fool the audience into thinking that Seagal is there when he really isn't.  I was actually swearing out loud at the TV because of how much of a waste of my time it all was.Ticker is actually an insult even to the DTV market.  Yes, you heard that.  There are DTV movies out there that are actually much, much better than Ticker.  This is hands down one of the most worthless movies I've ever seen in my life, and is definitely one of the worst movies Seagal has ever starred in.  It's right alongside &#34;The Foreigner,&#34; &#34;Out For A Kill,&#34; and &#34;Attack Force.&#34;  Just forget this movie even exists and everything will be alright."

We've learned the best brand is Flexi (Please add comment if you've experienced a better brand.)This time we bought size medium, at $18.57. The 'highway grade reflective sheeting' is a nice additional (for us) feature . Everything else is as expected from the Flexi brand. The handle is good size for larger hands (I don't believe handle is this size for the Small leash...again, add comment if I'm wrong.)The construction is what we have learned to expect from Flexi, and though NO cord is immune from weakening, eventual destruction of chewing, it is made strong to start with.I'll update this review as necessary."
1766871,B0028Y4Q2O,Stay Away !!!!,"As mentioned in other reviews, I wanted to like the saw, but it was simply impossible. I have always placed trust in Makita's quality and performance, but this experience has completely changed that view. I purchased the saw when it first hit the market. Because the saw was new to Makita's product line there were very few reviews on its performance. The first unit I received looked like the box had dropped out of a semi going down the highway. It was returned and a replacement sent. I was very happy with the saws performance for the first couple of months. Although I had no bearing issues, as other had mentioned, I started to notice that the handle started shaking when making any type of cut in any type of wood. It got to the point where the saw was no longer safe and on several occasions I experienced ""kick-back"". I called Makita and was told they had never heard of this before. As the saw was still under warranty, I was told that I needed to take it to the nearest Makita repair facility, which ended up being a 50 mile round trip. When I dropped off the saw all of the repair techs said this was the first time that they had ever heard of this problem associated with this saw. Ironically, one of Makita's resellers overheard the conversation and made the comment that a number of his customers have returned these units for the exact same reason - BLADE WOBBLE. The saw sat there for three months. During that period, I was contacted three times advising me the saw was ready to be picked up. However, every time I tested it at the repair facility the problem remained. Even the service techs told me it was still a problem. I can only assume that the saw was tested by simply starting it up, but never actually to the point where any cuts were made. It got to the point where the manager ended up sending the old unit back to Makita and replacing it with a new unit. Once again, everything was fine for the first couple of months, then the BLADE WOBBLE issue returned. I am not in the trades and use the saw exclusively for small projects. I do find it interesting that the number of hours usage prior to this problem was the same for both saws, roughly eight to ten. Because of this limited usage, I am now stuck with a saw that is worthless given the fact that I was advised that the replacement unit only carries a 90 day guarantee."

1828157,B0000024MZ,Another great album from Warren G.,"Warren G's sophomore album Take A Look Over Your Shoulder is one of G-Funk's great albums. This fun and interesting album has it all: bouncing party beats, the thoughtful lyrics, and that great G-Funk style and flavor. The songs are all touched with sun-soaked keyboards, and most notably the great guitar in many of the songs. The innovative styles and rapping on this album are breezy and laid-back, which is definitely Warren's style. In my mind, he is the true originator of G-Funk production, not Dr. Dre or Big Hutch, and Daz Dillinger would be G-Funk's greatest innovator. Warren also is a great rapper, his lyrics are comical and thoughtful at the same time. This was Warren's first album to be released on his new label, G-Funk Recordings, and this album has excellent guests as well. Nate Dogg, Ron Isley, Jayo Felony, Mr. Malik, The Five Footaz, The Twinz, Reel Tight, and Erick Sermon, plus many others. These guests fit well with Warren's beautiful beats.Highlights on this album include ""Annie Mae"", a great duet with Nate Dogg, which will remind many of Warren's hit ""Regulate"", because it once again has Warren and Nate trading lines. This time though, it's about a girl named Annie Mae, and Warren and Nate compliment each other well here. The second single ""Smoking Me Out"", features Ron Isley singing the hook for a bouncy party track. Warren puts in a very nice rap, as well as on the excellent ""Reality"", a laid-back track celebrating a sunset gangsta scene. On ""Young Fun"", Jayo Felony and Knee-Hi join Warren for a funky gangsta track about life as a kid. Even though the promotional version of ""What We Go Through"" features Kurupt and Daz Dillinger and was taken off of the album, the new one is an excellent track, featuring Bad A$$, Mr. Malik and Technique (who is listed on the album as Perfect) for a pretty piano-laced track. On this song, Warren disses LL Cool J, really tearing him up. Many have wondered why Warren did diss LL, and it was because LL dissed Warren on his 1995 Mr. Smith LP. ""We Brings Heat"" is a nice track that features The Five Footaz and The Twinz, and is very good though Warren's beat sounds kind of like West Coast Mobb Deep (if one can picture that), it's still a great beat. ""Transformers"" is another nice keyboard-laced track, extremely nice laid-back track with a vocoder chorus. My favorite is ""Relax Your Mind"", which features Reel Tight singing the chorus, and a relaxing beat that really does clear your thoughts. ""To All DJ's"" is sure to get the party up, an extremely funky track with Mr. Malik. The first single ""I Shot The Sheriff"", is another one of the album's best, while the remix is included and done by Erick Sermon of EPMD, and the beat is a sample of ""Strictly Business"", performed by EPMD. On the European version, there is the bonus ""What's Love Got To Do With It"", and the song's remix. I have heard it and it's a great song, with cool guitars and lyrics. All of the tracks are good, ""Back Up"" is probably the album's worst, but it still is excellent.To conclude my review, I would recommend this if you like G-Funk. If you do, it's a must."
1298070,B000CBE3G4,Vintage sound without vintage pedal pricing!,"These FAB pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre, but I bought this on a whim to use with a Fender tube amp and it works well. As other reviewers have stated, the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it's not abused. I use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects.I have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay. I don't know if I would gig with this pedal or any othe FAB pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments, but it serves it's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect. I have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future.I have alot of other pedals and I tried this pedal with a jazz bass, with some EQ tinkering, I found a good mix of echo. I originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a D-4 and thought it would be a good idea. Again, Danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay, but this is a good deal and was $100 dollars cheaper than my Electro Harmonix Memory Boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp."

1870112,B0007NFL18,"As Jigga would say, ""Had a spark when you started, but now you're just garbage""","50 Cent is simply a joke.  ""The Massacre"" is only his second album, and he's already got nothing to rap about.  But he's obviously still hungry for money, so what did he do?  He went pop.  This album contains some songs about guns, some garbage dance songs and the rest are all ""I-need-you-in-my-life-baby"" kind of songs.  It's funny how he's making exactly the type of music he dissed Ja Rule for making.  Oh, it also has that diss song ""Piggy Bank"" which, frankly, is weak as hell.  I can't believe 50 Cent thinks he's so good, he has the nerve to start feuds with rappers whom actually have alot to talk about, and whom have been around much longer than him.  He disses Jadakiss, Nas, Shyne, Fat Joe, Kelis, and drops even more names on that one song ""Piggy Bank.""  All of these artists have responded back to him, and they can actually record entire diss songs towards him, not drop one line like he does.He also kicked The Game out of G-Unit just because Game is friends with Jadakiss and Nas.  50 Cent acts like he's in elementary school.  If he knows what's good for him, he'll quit while he's behind with all these beefs.  Don't waste your money on this CD."

1354722,B0002UEDPG,Fun.... For A Bit,"I have to agree with most of the reviews in that this game is truly a masterpiece of real-time-strategy (RTS). I have played many of these types of games and I found that this game offers all of the features that I always thought would make the ultimate game in this genre. You start in the ancient age and work your way all the way up to modern times. That fact alone is amazing. It is very satisfying to watch your units upgrade through the ages, from cavalry to stealth bombers, from wooden war ships to aircraft carriers. Very cool!What gets me is the replay value of the game. I started off with the Conquer the World Campaign, which places you on a large risk type map and allows you to move armies around and invade countries with the ultimate goal of capturing the entire world. I picked the Germans and thus started with my capital in Berlin, Germany. The first few missions were fun. I captured some territory from the locals by forming raiding parties and sweeping through and destroying everything. No building and gathering resources in these missions. I was still having fun when I declared war on Greece and began to fight my first real battles. The default objective is that if you are invading a territory held by another country you have 90 minutes to capture the enemy capital. If you are being invaded you need to hold out for 90 minutes. Sounds fun. The only problem is every battle is set up the same way. How long to the expect me to keep fighting 90 minute battles that are complete replays of the last one. You start with one city and some troops and citizens, you build up your economy, and eventually you have the resources and army to defeat your enemy. That's it! Over and over! I did it about 10 times before I had enough.I must admit that I didn't try any of the other campaigns (I think there are 5 total such as Alexander The Great and The Cold War). I just couldn't force myself to put this game in, start gathering resources, and do the exact same thing I had done the time before. I'm sure I missed something by not playing these other campaigns, but I just couldn't force myself to play this over Call of Duty. And I am of the opinion that you should never have to force yourself to play a game to begin with.While there is some satisfaction in building up a large army and destroying your enemy it quickly gets overshadowed by the repetition of the game. If you are thinking of buying this game in the hopes of conquering the world and are not the type of person who enjoys completing the same monotonous task over and over then I would look elsewhere. While I can see why so many people enjoy this game, I wanted to present some reasons for why you may not."

207462,B00014ECYK,Taste Good and Good for You...,"The primary reason I bought this brand of brewer's yeast is from the information I learned from Shane Ellison M. Sc. The People's Chemist web site, he says,  ""The term folate (not folic acid) encompasses a slew of naturally occurring chemical cousins - chemists call them isomers - that have a wide range of positive roles in the body. Without full-spectrum natural folate, our body becomes a breeding ground for Alzheimer's disease, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, neural tube defects, poor cognitive performance, depression, hearing loss and many types of cancer.""  ""...folic acid (the toxic one) in fortification programs worldwide could have, ""the side effect of increasing the prevalence of some of the most significant, human life-threatening diseases"", scary stuff IMO.  Since I'm trying to rely less on multivitamins because of the toxic ingredients contained in them i.e. folic acid  among others, I decided to try the brand he recommends. This brewer's yeast as decent amounts of Folate Acid,(the correct one),Thiamin,Riboflavin,Niacin,B6,Phosphorus,Magnesium,Zinc,Selenium,Copper and Chromium plus Potassium .I use it sprinkled on salad and in soup and I think it taste good. Just knowing I'm getting real vitamins instead of the Franken ones make me feel better."
3761285,B00AZPI0NE,BRIGHT and well made.,"I bought a couple of these to put between the tubes on the rear bumper of my Jeep Wrangler for additional backup lighting.  I replaced the tail light bulbs earlier with LED bulbs, but that just did not do it for me out in the woods when it came to seeing where I was backing.  So I put two of these between the tubing of my rear bumper, wired them and then turned them on.  WOW!  I do believe these are as bright as headlights back there.  I could not believe how bright they are; and LED will not pull much juice.  I read other reviews about quality and the seal around the lens.  Not sure what they received, but the two I received are heavy cased and sealed well around the lens.  Just to make sure, I took a little clear silicon and spread it around the edge of the lens.  I was very lucky that the lights were just the right size to fit between the bumper tubing.  For the price, you can't go wrong with these lights.  I am planning to order two more to put under the sides of my Jeep for lighting up out to the side when I am out in the woods.  They really throw some light!"

After what seemed like half an hour I started fuming, ""Come on, I just want to play already!""  When I did start to play the AI struck me as overly dumb and then I got distracted by real life.  After a few days I realized I really had no desire to go back and pick this game up again.Maybe I should give it more time?

When you want to talk, the flap kind of gets in the way, so folding the cover all the way back is causing far more wear and tear around the center than I would have liked.It brings great protection, I have dropped my phone more than a few times and the phone is intact.  The screen is in perfect condition.

2849889,B000DZ95IU,Love the Company!,"I have to admit, Three's Company is one of my guilty pleasures!  I was not allowed to watch as a child, but LOVE reliving those days gone by as an adult.  This seller got the product to me sooner than expected.  Was back in 1980 in no time!  Great product!"
487599,B008YQM4A6,Impossible to withstand,"The taste is so horrible and the burning is so bad that I can't use this product long enough to see if it whitens teeth.  I've tried three nights to swish the mouthwash in my mouth, but it tastes so horrible I spit it out immediately.  I've even tried adding it to the water in my waterpik (very diluted), and I still can't stand the taste.  I'm dumping out the rest of the bottle.  I wasted my money, don't waste yours."

1427608,B001VJ4DHK,Mass Effect 2,"Pros:* RPG/FPS Space style game that allows you to build your team with multiple quests* the ability to provide directions to 2 NPC teammates of your chosing for each quest* Multiple Mini-gamesCons:* Some of the Mini-Games tend to get a little monotinous at times and yet are still necessary* The game could be a little longer but does have replay valueAll in all, this is a great game and I would recommend it to anyone."
1710266,B0002JJU2I,Elenco Electronics TL-6LG Large Alligator to Large Alligator Test Lead Set,"I have found this set of test leads to be very decent for the price. They have come in handy for bench work and also for things like jumpering thermostat terminals and making other temporary control wiring connections. The test leads are 36"" long overall and made from five different colors of 20AWG stranded copper wire with insulation rated for 600V at 105C. The color matched insulated alligator clips will open to approximately 5/16"" max and are nickel plated with soldered connections and a crimped metal strain relief. They have nice strong springs with teeth sharp enough to make good low resistance connections and firmly grip bare wiring and screw terminals. There was no indication on the actual packaging as to where they were made, so I will just have to assume it is China. I also don't see any UL or other ETL listing anywhere on them, but then I didn't really expect there to be at this price, so not an issue for me. Overall, these test leads have worked well for everything I have needed them to do so far and seem to be of good quality, especially when considering that they were less than ten dollars for a set of ten here on Amazon."
1665650,B0080SRA16,"Diet Coke, 8 PK, 7.5 ox. cans",My usual choice for a soft drink is Diet Coke so selecting the new 7.5 oz. cans was just to try the new packaging as I knew what the soft drink tasted like. Some would say that the 7.5 oz. cans are too small but with added ice they fill an 8 oz. glass and that is all one sometimes needs to quench thirst. The smaller cans are also good for travel and for packing in children's lunches.
1677961,B00C1CLQGC,Not Good,Knorr often has great flavored cooking aids.  This isn't one of them.  The taste doesn't justify the amount of salt and msg it has.  These are two things most people try to avoid in their diet.  On the plus side it's easy to prepare though it's not worth the effort.  I've also tried the red rice flavor which I also did not like however this variety is even worse than the red.

1844083,B000003AEK,2PAC'S OTHER MASTERPIECE,"[Pop Culture Quiz: ___________________ is to READY TO DIE as ALL EYES ON ME is to LIFE AFTER DEATH]This is the album that really highlights everything that made 2Pac a legendary artist.  This is truly 2Pac at his most poetic and introspective.  He may have never summed up his feelings of paranoia and remorse inflicted by ""thuglife"" more perfectly than in ""So Many Tears"".  ""Dear Mama"" is the epitome of what seperates 2Pac from countless other gangsta rappers who can emulate the violent side of ""thuglife"" but lack the heart.  Like ""Keep Ya Head Up"" and ""Brenda's Got A Baby"" on his previous LP's 2Pac demonstrates your can be hard and still have love simultaneously.  Songs like ""Me Against The World"" and ""F*** The World"" reveal 2Pac's feelings of alienation from society at large that affectively created the rebellious side of his personality.  He also includes tracks for the ladies (""Can U Get Away"") and his hip hop predecessors (""Old School"") as well as the temptations of everyday life(""Temptations"").  The production, supplied in large part by Easy Mo Be who handled the bulk of the production on Biggie's READY TO DIE, supports the reflective lyrics to perfection.  2Pac himself said the album has an overall bluesy feel making it the perfect counterpart to ALL EYES ON ME's thug-party atmosphere.  These two albums are somewhat the yin and the yang of 2Pacs personalities."
188112,B00HI3HQWM,Bolse USB Rapid Charger,"I can honestly say that I was very impressed by the quality of the Bolse USB Rapid Charger. I really don&#8217;t leave a lot of product reviews, but I just couldn't resist leaving some positive feedback for this item and its potential future buyers.First things first, I was more than a little hesitant when it came to purchasing this charger. I have purchased a few types of multi-port USB chargers in the past and was left disappointed. Most of these chargers were cheaply made and only worked for a few weeks. There were a few key factors that promoted me into trying the Bolse brand of USB Charger.First, I liked the fact that the charger worked with almost any electronic that I own or would even be interested in owning that charges off of a USB port. The next factor that appealed to me was that the charger is protected against overheating, over-currents, and over-charging. The charger even automatically stops charging when the battery of the item/s plugged into it is completely charged. The third aspect that I approved of is that the charger operates at twice the power of other chargers, so it charges my items not only safely but quickly as well. The last factor is that the charger has 4 USB ports, which is perfect for my charging needs.Honestly, I figured that the charger would be worth the gamble. It&#8217;s cheap compared to most chargers and has a One-Year Limited Warranty. I have been using the Bolse USB Rapid Charger for a few weeks now and from what I can tell it works perfectly. I am personally very impressed with my charger and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reliable charger. I will mostly certainly be ordering Bolse brand items again in the future."
3138778,B00275EGWY,It was mediocre,"This was an average rental. The critics got ecstasy over it but I honestly didn't feel it. Saving Private Ryan  [Blu-ray] was a much better film than this in terms of a gripping war-movie, plot, and cinematography. The entire plot for this film pretty much focuses on the main character deciding whether to cut the blue wire or the red wire. That is the movie in a nutshell if you like that type of entertainment."

1463966,B003O6N266,Black Box really dropped the ball with this one.,"I have been playing the NFS series since its beginning on the 3DO. (look it up) When I got my 360 Need for Speed Most Wanted instantly became my favorite racing game. After that though there wasn't a good NFS title until the recent Hot Pursuit which almost knocked Most Wanted out of the top spot IMO. EA touted The Run as a return to those breakneck races against the cops and rivals. The cutscenes looked great running on foot from the law right? Well as someone who bought this game for both the PS3 and 360 I can honestly tell you that The Run pales in comparison to Hot Pursuit and Most Wanted.PROS:The graphics look great.The idea for the game is AWESOME.CONS:The handling is TERRIBLE, its like every car slides over the road like its constantly skidding over ice.EA is again not giving you all the content on the disc by making you use an online code to unlock online multiplayer.This should have been like CannonBall Run but, they break the races up so much its like race for 2 min the reat is loading screens.AND FINALLY the loading, there is no excuse that you spend more time watching loading screens than playing the game in 2012. Seriously this game needed to not ship if a race can be finished in 2-3 min but, the loading time is 3 min?If you need to reset or restart the race expect another 3-4 min wait to get back in the action. I think I posted a review earlier about this game and thought maybe I was too harsh on it. I went back and replayed the entire game a second time and I was correct this game shipped flawed. Shame on you EA for doing this to your fans. Your QA dept should have spent more time on this product. I hope you don't put $$ before the quality of work you shovel out year after year. You know you don't need a NEW 60 game on the market every year right? Just make a quality game and release DLC for it. If your game is good people will play gladly for the DLC. And don't charge for online play, that just makes you look greedy. I don't dislike EA as a company but, I hope they step up and do the right thing or people will stop buying there games all together."

1948322,0783229526,Drug Voyeurs,"This movie is for all those sad people who want to do drugs but don't (and there are a great many of them). Watching these two guys get stoned in Las Vegas is similar to watching two people making love, very deeply unsatisfying. It's one of those things that you've got to do yourself. No amount of watching helps. I watched it because of Terry Gilliam, but he wasn't able to find any artistic tension in the &quot;anything goes&quot; atmosphere of a drug binge in Vegas."

1750114,B0012QMTPA,Good water heater,"It took me quite a while to prevent the enclosed pressure relief valve from leaking, but finally, after experimenting with teflon tape and joint compound, I found the right combo. Everything else about this heater worked fine; on the maximum setting it delivered  hot water; not as hot as an instant hot, but quite acceptable. The heater seems to be well made and I so far, two months, I am happy with it. When I contacted tech support about the leak they suggested that I use a plumber to install it, but I felt that that was expensive and overkill for what should be a simple task. We'll see how the unit holds up, but for now I'm happy."

1300670,B001REJX1U,Another loser company producing a broke @$$ product they didn't test,"I really wanted this to be a great product.  The screws strip out too easily.  Basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out.  I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon.  Nope.  Even the pop filter fell off.  I LOVE the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex:  adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc.  Otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option.  Just make it one solid piece.  I'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design.  It's just not strong enough.  Not that it's a surprise though.  Not much of anything is worth the money these days.  It's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products.  Why should they?  They already have your money.  I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up.  Besides, what are they going to do?  Replace it with another broke a$$ product?  Better yet, refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping????  That doesn't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place.  I want a refund, plus an hourly wage.  Whatever, don't buy one.  Companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business.  What would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s):  Did you test this product?  How did you test it?  What were your results?  Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?Nope"

1734960,B000LV9V9Y,Significantly changes the water output point of your shower,"This showerhead extends your shower arm by many inches downward which can cause problems with the water flow output point. In my shower, it caused the water to be coming out too low. (My shower arm rough-in is 76"" high and I'm 5'9"".) So I went and bought an S-shaped shower arm replacement to elevate the shower head by about 8 inches. Now the water comes out high enough but shoots out too far meaning I have to stand farther away than I'd like. This would be fine if the showerhead could angle so it points more downward but the ball-and-socket joint prevents it from doing so. Depending on your personal shower preferences and layout, these issues might not be a problem, but for me, I'm in the market for a new showerhead."
396692,B003KVO0DY,Didn't work for me...,"Ever since I started taking an oral chemo drug about 1 1/2 years ago, insomnia has been a huge problem. I went about eight months without a good night's sleep, and when my oncologist wouldn't help me out, I talked to my family doctor, who prescribed a very mild sleep aid. Most of the time it works, but some nights I toss and turn for hours. Since this medication is supposed to be fine with any other medication, I thought it was worth a try. I took it on two consecutive nights without my prescribed sleep aid, and I tossed and turned for about four hours each night before finally dropping off to sleep. On another night when my prescribed sleeping pill didn't work, I tried chewing a couple of these, and they didn't work then, either. I'm sure they must work for some people, but I'm not one of them. My advice would be to try the smallest quantity available to see if they work for you. If so, it's a wonderful, natural alternative, but if they don't help, you'll know it right away."

3700354,B004ABC13Y,I love this crate!,"Awesome soft crate. It was super easy to put together, just snap the two metal bars into place and your done! I got this to use for my 65lb lab when we go to agility trials and the 36in. is plenty big for her.  She would probably fit into the 30in. I plan to buy 2 more smaller ones so I can fit the two of them side by side in my taurus as the 36in. fits but has to be taken down to fit through the door, and then set up inside the car.  I love the carrying case and strap that it comes with and it appears really durable.  I would not advise this for a dog to be left alone in unless you know for sure that they don't chew and don't have problems with separation anxiety as a dog could easily chew through this, or figure out how to open the zipper (as they could do with ANY soft sided crate), but for travel it is great! It also came super fast!Update feb 26, 2013: still love this crate but at our last agility event it was brought to my attention that a dog could easily roll the crate by leaning on the walls because of how lightweight it is. I heard from other people their dogs had figured out how to ""walk"" around in it by rolling it around! My lab did almost flip it a couple time because if how she was sitting, but I had no issues... Yet. I still prefer it over the bulky, heavy wire crates for travel, and I plan to just put some sand bags or something in or around the crate if I have issues!"

1873695,B000F0UV3Q,"A year later, and it's still wack.","When Purple Haze came out, I was one of the first people to come to Cam'ron's defense on the quality of the album. A lot of people were hating on Cam, but I found Purple Haze to be one of the best commercial hip-hop albums in the late 2004/early 2005 season. The production was dope, and Cam'ron's flow was more on point than it'd ever been. Purple Haze made a genuine Cam'ron fan out of me; unfortunately, Killa Season has not only erased the good memories that I had bumping Purple Haze, but has also left a sour impression of Killa Cam in my mind.When Killa Season came out, it was highly anticipated for myself. I was expecting Cam to follow the Purple Haze formula, and take it to another level. I was expecting a cast full of big-budget producers, and hot guest appearances from some of the industry's best. At the very least, I was expecting Cam to be on his A-Game, especially since he was launching a verbal war against the Jigga man. Not one of those wishes came true on Killa Season; in fact, every single one of those things I'd hope for were not only absent from this album, but they were substituted with some of the most dissapointing hip-hop I've ever had the displeasure to listen to.The only producer you'll recognize in the liner notes of Killa Season is the almighty Alchemist; however, even geniuses can make mistakes, and that's no more apparent than his production work on Wet Wipes. The production is poor, and Cam'ron's flow and lyrics are both so inane that they'll have you thumping your head before the track ever finished; against a desk, or a wall, that is. What should've been a dope collaboration between one of the underground's best producers and one of the mainstream's most 'unique' emcees turns out to be one of the worst hip-hop tracks in recent memory.Guests? DipSet. Not the better half of DipSet either - you get third-stringer tiers Hell Rell and 40 Cal on a handful of tracks while Jim Jones and Juelz Santana only make a couple guest appearances, suspiciously absent. The only non-DipSet guest is their regular affiliate, Lil Wayne, who drops undoubtedly the best verse on the album on the otherwise mundane Touch It Or Not.Cam'ron himself? He's simply embarrassing on this release. He sings(yes, SINGS) some of the most asinine lyrics I've ever heard on He Tried To Play Me, while detailing his real life struggle with Irritable Bowel Syndrome(dear Lord) on the track appropriately named IBS. Both of these tracks will have you in hysterics throughout; not because Cam's delivering hilarious punchlines, but because they're, for lack of a better term, simply stupid. He tries to diss Jay-Z on You Gotta Love It, but ends up releasing a diss track that is less effective than even Ja Rule's Clap Back(and most certainly of lower-quality). His simple rhyme schemes can be forgiven when he's got hot beats, but his definiciencies as an emcee have never been more transparent than they are on Killa Season.Up until the release of Killa Season, I had always defended Cam'ron against people who were claiming he was a wack emcee. He was never phenomenal in my mind, but the potential was always there; on Killa Season, everything is suddenly flushed down the toilet(no pun intended). Losing his spot as DipSet's man for humor to Jim Jones, his spot as the heir to any sort of throne to Juelz, and his spot as a 'real emcee' to JR Writer, Cam'ron has become nothing more than a washed-up emcee who was never great to begin with. No matter how much I wanted to like Killa Season, a year later, it's still as wack as it was the first time I heard it. Unless he can come back with the hottest album of his career next go around, Cam's career is over."

I ""goggled"" MK Morse and it looks like they make only blades in Ohio? My guess is they are making the DeWalt blades for DeWalt at they are a tool manufacture not a blade manufacture.  When I was at my local ""Menards"" they sell MK Morse too.So the blades are fine (gave them 2 stars) but the deal is not good (gave them 2 stars).MK Morse RBKITHD01 Heavy Duty Reciprocating Blade Assortment With Storage Case, 12-Piece"

3741966,B000276B2C,Reliable even after  50K motorcycle miles,"My experience by no means is a proven scientific method of analysis, but the trend I have experienced with Fram filters has been one of reliability. I used Fram on everything from motorcycles, ATVs, cars and my 4x4 trucks. Not one has shown any indication of failure. My truck with over 300K miles is well within its compression window and doesn't blow the least bit of smoke. My motorcycle has over 50K miles and it too doesn't show any appreciable wear.Does that mean Fram is flawless? Nothing is, but I changed 1000s of engine oil for myself and 100s of friends over 30yrs. I am presently using this 6017A series on a Polaris ATV which is exposed to extreme conditions in the Florida swamps with much success.Maybe Fram fails easier than others when you push the envelope with going long on an oil change interval. Since I change oil religiously, I may never know what the failure point of a Fram filter is, and I am certainly not interested in finding out the hard way.I trust Fram as good balance between quality, reliability and cost."

3619907,B0009ZBKGE,"Didn't Work for Us, but Might for You!","My real-world observations indicate the efficacy of this harness is highly dependent upon the breed of canine to which it is attached.In plain English: how good or bad this is depends on what kind of dog you've got. This didn't work too well on our dog, a 40-pound Whippet/Shepherd mix. I think it had everything to with her body type. Her greyhound-like chest ensured that the harness wouldn't stay put, and since she's kind-of low to the ground, she would constantly trip over the leash. Five minutes into a walk, the thing was completely out of sorts and needed to be readjusted. Since the harness moved around too much, it was actually wearing down the fur at the top of her front legs. We switched to thePremier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collarand have been much happier with the results.However, I can definitely see the potential benefits of this harness with the ""right"" dog. It came highly recommended by the trainer at PetSmart, and everyone in our basic training class was using it, many of them with great success. The general principle is sound -- when your dog pulls, the harness squeezes their front legs together, forcing them to stop. If you want to give it a shot, I'd recommend buying it at a retail store to make it easier to return in the event that you don't like it. It's worth trying for a few days to see if it works for you."

1880906,B003UDBSVY,A Band Adrift,"Bands use the self-titled album as a means of telling their fans that they're going back to basics, that this album will rediscover what made the band great in the first place.  That's almost assuredly what Interpol wished to communicate by releasing a self-titled album after their critically derided Our Love to Admire.  Unfortunately, despite whatever good intentions, Interpol's latest fails to live up to the promise of their first two moody and exhilarating albums.Interpol starts off promising with ""Success,"" a song built almost entirely upon their muscular rhythm section.  However, by the second song, ""Memory Serves,"" many of the album's reoccurring weaknesses quickly become apparent.  Like much of the album, ""Memory Serves,"" relies too heavily on a feeble and repetitive chorus that lead singer, Paul Banks, strains to sell like he's some sort of low level stock broker.  Lyrically the album trades in the sort of over worn love loss that mistakes clich&eacute;s for directness.  In ""Summer Well"" Banks pleads, ""I miss you babe / I want you back,"" and as a listener I can only think to myself, ""Who cares?""  Interpol have never been known for their lyrical prowess, but on their first two albums you could count on them to use obtuse abstraction now and again to set the mood.That's not to say that Interpol doesn't have its good moments.  The orchestration on ""Always Malaise"" and the piano on ""Try it On"" point to a fuller sound that still might reinvigorate the band.  Unfortunately, even the interesting sonic tricks on Interpol are buried under thick production that flattens any dynamics in their sound.  These aren't songs, they're mosquitoes frozen in amber.  The front cover of Interpol shows the band's name in a state of deconstruction.  Well, judging from their past few albums, the band should spend some more time figuring out how to tear their sound apart rather than putting it back together."

I am so happy I finally got to see the video for 'Afraid', it makes me wonder even more how this wasn't a hit - it's seriously one of the coolest videos I've ever seen (and an amazing song to match)!  Also, I must confess, I had no idea the Crue made 3 videos with Corabi - and they're all great (especially 'Misunderstood').  Of course all the classics are there, too.  The picture and sound are crystal clear - and the interview segments with Nikki and Tommy are entertaining and insightful (I love when they discuss how underrated 'S/T' and 'Generation Swine' are - couldn't agree more).  I had no trouble locating the 'easter egg' for 'Shout At the Devil '97', but still am unable to access 'Take Me To the Top' and 'Publc Enemy #1' (which are supposidly on here as well).  Crue was never the deepest or most profound band, but man this is some awesome rock and it's great to see this career spanning collection of videos."

1509765,B0086V5V9A,What a shame...,"This could have been a great comeback after the somewhat disappointing &#34;Conviction&#34;.  Blacklist keeps some of the gameplay mechanics from that previous game while also channeling the more stealth-based pre-Conviction games so what you get is a mix of the old and the new.  Stealth is once again a much more prudent approach as opposed to guns blazing.  The mark and execute &#34;win button&#34; is back but you can simply choose not to use it.  Sadly, Michael Ironside is no longer voicing Sam Fisher which seems to be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.  No offense to the new guy, but the character in this game is not Sam Fisher, doesn't sound like him, doesn't act like him - he is an imposter.  Without Ironside's involvement hey should have just created an entirely new character for this game, you can't have Fisher without Ironside - it's like waffles with no maple syrup - it's just not right.  Another problem is the tiny &#34;go-out-and-buy-a-bigger-tv&#34; fonts used.  I hate that.  HATE IT.  Making things like mission briefings, weapon loadouts, and other important texts difficult or impossible to read is utterly inexcusable.  These two major complaints in my option RUIN what could have been a 5-star game."
3750249,B000RXNLK6,Amazing. Simply......incredible.,"Do you remember back in the early 2000's when Rain-X came out? Everyone was using it from snowboard goggles to car windows. It was - AMAZING.I just grabbed some of this quick detailer off the shelf last night thinking to myself - dang, $12.00 a bottle is a lot for some fancy detailer junk! Then I put my big-boy pants on, nutted up - and convinced myself a $45K Lexus was worth a few extra bucks. I went home - hand washed the IS350 - and was AMAZED as soon as the microfiber towel hit this stuff!! Years back I had used Mcgueirs quick detailer (in 2001) when it first came out, and had random people ask me what it was when I left the car wash (I'd drive through car wash, then spray it on afterwards and hand dry) this stuff - is 10X what that was back then. It's honestly amazing - spray it on - and then wipe away what feels like oil off of a dolphin.

We needed more power to charge the iPads quicker and more ports in general.  One of the annoyances with the Levition 2.1 charger is the dedicated high power port which my wife just didn't understand and then didn't understand why her iPad took so long to charge.  One thing many people don't understand it iPads require the 10 and now 12 watt chargers to charge quickly so the four port allows both iPads to charge quickly at the same time while still charging other things.I suspect I will soon be looking for an 8 port charger.

1344399,B00009WNZA,Makes the original Sims Look like Pong,"WOW am I impressed with this new version of ""The Sims"".  My gut feeling tells me that you're not going to be able to sell your old versions because everyone is going to want this one instead.  I knew it too because when I saw the previews, I stopped buying the expansion packs, immediately, just to wait this one out.How is it?  Fantastic.  The graphics are fluid and smooth, the characters have fingers, wedding rings, facial expressions, man, you name it they've worked on it and it's obvious.  The clothing has fluidity (the hair too) and zooming in close up to a character's face really shows some detail.  Nice, nice job.  Playing the game *is* pretty similar to the first but you can tell Maxis did their homework and I can just see Will saying: ""Okay, THIS is what the fans want"" cause it sure looks like they worked on it.For instance, its the little things that make a difference.  When a sim walks in the room, the other sims react, say hello... I had a dad come home from work and the child he was close to dropped her toy and ran out to greet him by jumping in his arms.  They are no longer stiff like the first Sims, they have reactions which are pretty cool.  Also, there's an amazing amount of detail.  The fridge has a variety of food (and can be emptied now, unfortunately, but you call the grocer) and the more a Sim knows how to cook, the different varieties of food they can make.  A Sim can cook either Salmon or Mac and Cheese and they look exactly like they seem.  That was pretty wild to pause and inspect.What else?  They age.  Yup, they sure do.  It's better than the first and more difficult as well.  My Sims tried for a baby -- and first of all ended up with twins!  Holy cow, that was work.  Now, the infants cry for different things and just feeding and holding them doesn't work anymore.  They're specific.  Changing the diaper... bathing them... all the little things you'd expect with a baby, except they're babies for only a few days, then toddlers for a few days, then they turn into kids and teens and so on.Think its easy?  Nope.  You gotta nurture the kid through your Sim.  Early nurturing calls for good development.  Teaching them to walk, talk and communicating makes a better child who is better in school eventually.  Unfortunately, I've got some lazy sims who don't want to help their kids with homework and the social worker keeps coming to take them away.  It goes pretty quick, too.  This isn't your old Sims games, either... they don't just sob a bit when this happens -- the parents endup traumatized.Neglect the Sims and there's consequences.  Let's say... the sim's social meter is really, really low.  They can actually snap and start babbling.  Next thing I know, a therapist drops in and starts helping the sim out.  Funny part of that -- the therapist is only visible when you click on the sim that is nuts.  How funny is that?Oh... remember the ghosts?  They're actually pretty creepy in this one.  They move things and will animate other things as well.  Apparently, they have a certain colored glow for how they died.  Haven't figured that one out yet.Building the homes is pretty cool, too.  Yup, you can actually put in a basement, but you have to dig a hole first and that kind of thing.  Windows can be put in for multiple floors and staircases are customized.  I miss the circular staircase, though.  What else is new?  Lots of furniture, customizing the roofs yourself, which is definitely a bit tricky if you're not creatively adept and spraying the grass different shades... i.e., brown, green, light green... like that.  Learning how to build the houses takes as much time as learning the new Sims habits.Good stuff?  You want the ""fun"" stuff?  Oh, the Sims are a LOT more flirty, little more R-rated but never oversteps the line.  ""Playing in bed"" is no longer -- it's called Woo Hoo!  You can ""goose"" a sim and flirt different ways.. you can have Woo Hoo in the hot tub and apparently in public as well (by the way, you can travel to little park areas like in the expansion packs of the first Sims.)  I may point out that there is a difference between Woo Hoo and Try for a Baby.  Woo Hoo I believe is w/contraceptives (LOL) otherwise, try for a baby seems to be no problem as my Sims get knocked up pretty quick.Oh!  The neighborhoods... you have three different neighborhoods (and you can customize how they look... there are quite a few similarities between these neighborhoods and SimCity... hmmm.... I wonder why?):)  Well, you can add all kinds of things... rocks, wildflowers, ocean surf, rainbows, clouds...etc.  The only thing I wish is that you can see this stuff when in the homes.  Example?  You place 20 giant rocks in the lot next to a Sim home -- inside the sim home you see nothing but a plain.  Maybe they'll fix it later, who knows?But each neighborhood has a ""story.""  I got the guidebook and apparently, you should visit certain houses first before others.  They have a chain reaction.  But that's if you want to actually work on the storyline.  You dont' have to.  The funny one would be the Strangeville neighborhood which Bella Goth has been sighted in (LOL) and there's a crashed space ship nearby.  People do get abducted by aliens, yup, but it's the MEN that get impregnanted.  That's pretty hysterical.Anything bad?  Just a few.  It does play like the first, but technologically-wise, we're not up to artificial intelligence, yet, so I'm pretty happy with what they've got.  There are a few glitches in the game I've come across already (i.e., a fire starts, fireman comes... but the fire just keep burning for eternity.)  As for loading it, I had some pretty big problems and couldn't do it for four hours -- massively ticked me off.  Ended up returning the discs to get new ones and they worked fine.  Got problems running it?  I'd recommend checking their site for tech issues.  It helped me.  but I have no doubt a patch will be coming out soon.Oh, and there's no rain.  I checked and waited.  Apparently, they've had problems getting the rain to work so they took it out.Great game.  Lots of fun -- can't wait what to find out next."

2491784,B00005JLSE,Sleazy,"Although I enjoyed the music in this film, that's about it. My biggest gripe is that there are no characters you can admire or even like in it. Roxie's husband is the only decent character, and he gets dumped on throughout the movie. The rest of the characters are sleazy, deceptive, awful people, and unfortunately that is celebrated throughout the film. Not surprising that the Hollywood cesspool went ga-ga over it. I was pleasantly surprised at Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellweger's singing and dancing ability, that much I will admit. However, I would recommend that you rent this movie before you buy it. I bought it before seeing it at the recommendation of a friend, and unfortunately wasted my money. It's not a movie I want to watch again."

2134673,6301257014,No wonder why Karloff didn't want to do anymore.,"This is the film that Boris Karloff retired his role as the Universal Frankenstein monster. As a sequal to the legendary Frankenstein (1931) and The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), Son of Frankenstein has much to live up to, and fails at all. The plot which is Ygor (Bela Lugosi) playing a flute, which is somehow controlling the monster (as if he were a snake in a basket) is lame. It takes nearly an hour before we even see the monster. The monster was a character in the first two Frankenstein films. Now he is basically a walking zombie and an accessory instead of a character. This film, is in no way, up to par with the first two Frankenstein films, it will forever, live in the shadows of Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein. The only reason I even gave this movie one star is because it had Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in it. This film was just uninspired. James Whale directed the first two films and gave them something. I was literally bored out of my mind watching this film. Just stick with the first two."
1779123,B003ARSYR6,"At Least The Free ""How-To"" Video is worth the $30","I've been a home woodworker for many years and have a pretty complete workshop. However, I have never done crown molding. So, I searched various blogs and crown molding jig reviews. Someone wrote that a 10"" miter saw, which I have, would probably not be big enough to support the crown molding jigs.  Also, cutting 5"" crown molding on a 10"" saw could be problematic. So, I ordered a new 12"" miter saw. As many know, the primary reason for many home projects is to justify the purchase of another tool! Looking at the crown molding jigs, there appeared to be a number of cheaper, about $30, jigs, and some for about $150. I didn't see that any of the cheaper jigs were highly rated.  Since this was my only planned crown molding project and since I am an old man, I didn't want to invest too much in a jig that might not work and may never be used again. The cost of the new saw and this Kreg jig added to the cost of my project, but I got a really good deal on the molding itself. What sold me on this jig was the two part video on crown molding, available free on the Kreg web site and other places.  This was made by Gary Streigler who also made another video on pocket hole contruction that I liked and in fact purchased before buying the Kreg pocket hole jig.  The crown molding video shows how to use the Kreg crown molding jig, but, I found the most value in the tips and techniques provided for measuring and installing crown molding.  That is the reason my title for this review is what it is.  I would have glady paid $30 just for the video as I'm sure it will save me time and result in a better installation.  As for the jig itself,  I'm not using it.  Many, if not all, of my following comments would probably apply to other jigs as well as the Kreg.  My primary concern is stability of the workpiece during the cut and cut repeatability. You have to hold the piece in the jig and then hold the jig against the fence while trying to make sure you cut at the right place and that the blade or blade guard doesn't hit the jig. Keeping the jig away from the blade guard means that more of the workpiece sticks out and I think leads to additional instability. Furthermore, when cutting, I couldn't bring the blade all the way down.  When I did, part of the metal blade guard hit the workpiece and put an 1/8"" gash in its edge.  This is, of course, due to the elevation of the workpiece from the work surface as it sits in the jig.  So, I had to stop the saw's motion and turn it off as soon as the blade cleared the workpiece. This in addition to holding everything and worry about this massive 12"" blade coming out to get me! I tried cutting several short pieces, about 12"", with all of the possible inside and outside cuts.  These would be used as ""test"" pieces. When installing door molding, I found it handy to have sets of test pieces at 44,45,46, etc., degrees, to quickly determine door squareness.  Of course, you can use an angle guide, which I have, but using the test pieces seemed quicker and more accurate for me.  I wanted to do the same with the crown molding. When I tried fitting the test pieces to each other, I found that they did not fit very well, probable due to some movement during cutting. I tried supporting one end of the molding on a roller stand. That did not work very well because, I think, with the molding at a 45 degree angle there is only a single point of contact with the roller.  Some may have built long extension tables for their saws that could provide additional support. I have my saw mounted on a Home Depot fold-up saw table for compact storage. My only extensions are rollers stands on each side of the saw which have worked very well on ""flat"" work.  At the very best, the lack of stability and miscuts were going to be too hard to manage so I gave up on the Kreg jig or trying another brand.  Next, I considered purchasing the optional crown molding stops and hold down for my new Hitachi.  But, these cheap, mostly useless, accessories were going to cost about 1/2 of what I paid for the saw!  So, no thanks. Furthermore, the stops are simply short tabs on each side of the saw.  I don't think they would support the workpiece very well either.  Next, I considered cutting the molding ""flat"" using the saw's miter AND bevel capability. This works, but since there aren't any detents at the required angles, repeatability doesn't seem easy to achieve. Also, the complexity of setting the angles and making sure the correct edge of the molding is against the fence ensures that there will be a lot of miscuts for a non-pro like me as well as more work.  I kept looking at the blogs and found a reference to a homemade jig by Joe Fusco.  He has a 2 part video on this on YouTube.  I built my jig pretty much like he describes except that I bolted it to my saw table.  I used existing holes that were intended to mount the stops instead of using the FesTool clamps Joe used.  These clamps are expensive and I don't have a need to rapidly install and remove the jig.  The attachment screws are easy enough to get to if I have to.  The best feature of this jig design is that the molding is completely supported across the front of the saw. In conclusion, I can't recommend this jig.  The included angle finder is well made and a good addition to your shop if you don't already have one. No matter what, go see the free Kreg video!"
1596645,B001O8PSRW,Great tasting popcorn!,"This is the brand we buy most often and unless it's not fresh, it pops really well.  I've gone back to using a large stainless steel saucepan (with lid of course) on the stovetop  I just add a dollop of organic coconut oil and the popcorn, turn the heat on medium and wait for it to pop.  I shake the pan a few times, but I'm not sure that's necessary.  I watch it so it doesn't burn though.  It's very tasty that way and I think it's one of the healthier ways to pop the corn, except for maybe using an air popper, but we don't like air popped corn that much.  I've bought this brand for years."

1609301,B002MRYEBA,Fun Assortment Of Snacks For A Young Child's Daytrip,"ExploreMunch's Turkey Stick & Cheese box meal from GoPicnic is a fun assortment of snacks for young children to take with them on daytrips to the museum (as colorfully illustrated by the box's cartoons), zoo, state park, etc.  I wouldn't recommend it for adults.  With its temporary tattoo, it is definitely intended for children.  Though the snacks are delicious and nutritious for children, they have too many preservatives for a health conscious adult to consume.  Furthermore, the box contains only 430 calories (170 from fat), which is not enough to satisfy an adult.  Since more than 30% of the total calories are from fat, most nutritionists would say that this is not a healthy meal for adults.The assortment of snacks is unique; it would be considered fun by the adventurous child who enjoys eating new types of foods.  The box contains the usual types of snacks that children like such as gummy bears, strawberry applesauce and a stick of turkey jerky.  Then there are snacks that seem more targeted for the health conscious adult such as the cubes of dry-roasted sunflower crunch and the baked snap peas.  The cheese is appropriate for children and adults; however, I preferred eating my cheese with crackers.  A small package of crackers should've been added to the box meal.  Also, I did not enjoy the taste of the turkey stick.  Perhaps, a package of thin slices of turkey meat would've been better tasting.  However, everyone's taste buds are different.  Most children may love the turkey stick.Overall, ExploreMunch's Turkey Stick & Cheese box meal from GoPicnic is a nice alternative for children who have grown tired of taking the same bag of snacks on those school or church sponsored daytrips.  It's easy for the parents who can grab the GoPicnic box rather than search the entire grocery store for a new assortment of goodies for their child to try.  Furthermore, refrigeration and heating are not required and it comes with a hinged spork and a lemon-scented towelette, which is very convenient.  The only thing missing is a drink and I'm sure whoever is sponsoring the event can provide that.  If you want to save yourself some time and money and give your adventurous child something fun and different to eat, then I highly recommend trying the ExploreMunch box meals from GoPicnic."

1454548,B0037LTTRO,Good game but has bug's,"I've played every mode of the game, it's a pretty good shooter. Their is some problems though, that the developer did not fix. Whenever I play co-op compaign with a friend sometimes I get a black screen. It does it to him also, this was right after we both purchased new copys of the game. We've gotten to the fourth mission but it won't go any farther. We ended up giving up on the co-op compaign mode because ubisoft still hasn't patched a fix for it.  I've played the multiplayer and other modes haven't had any problem with them. Yet on co-op compaign this is extremely annoying as the story mode is actually real good for a fps. Ubisoft is known to release games with bugs to meet deadlines, I'm just glad farcry 3 got pushed back so that maybe this type of thing doesn't happen to it."

This is a mid-sized table lamp that is weighty and very easy to assemble.  I had it up and running, in no time, without looking at the instructions.  The lamp, shade and parts, were packaged very nicely.It is a molded resin type lamp (that is ever-so-popular, these days) -- as opposed to a metal, ceramic or glass lamp.  Easy to clean, nothing to tarnish.Elegant, sleek, modern looking.  The lighting, through the light tan colored linen shade, is a beautiful bit of softness (for any area) that is hard to describe -- but, the diffused lighting, itself, is apt to make one appear 10 years younger.  I'm just saying. :)Off to buy another for my dining area!

1835607,B000002IXU,&quot;Under the Pink&quot; breaks out from under all limits...,"Brilliantly compelling, Amos' album, &quot;Under the Pink&quot; is a modern masterpiece thrilling the ears of all who listen.  Including breakthrough single &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; this album offers modern  music a greatly needed kick of symbolism, talent, and meaning.  Backed with  incredible lyrics, music, and Amos' one-of-a-kind haunting voice,  &quot;Under the Pink&quot; breaks stereotypes and proves that piano music  is good for something other than elevator radios!  The lusty playing and  daring technique Amos uses defies convention and creates a new standard not  only for classic piano, but for all music as well.  Powerful songs like  &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Baker, Baker&quot;, and &quot;Icicle&quot; balance  the wickedly humorous stylings seen in &quot;Waitress&quot; and &quot;Space  Dog&quot;.  Truly an album that will become a legend in its own right,  &quot;Under the Pink&quot; is an incredible musical accomplishment."

3572619,B00H9HZGQ0,Tried to like it,"This is supposed to be one of those underrated movies with a new and fascinating take on Modern Life. It came across as rather old hat, however, and mostly boring. I think I fell asleep a few times. What is supposed to be a cautionary tale of how devices are taking over human relationships (didn't we do this in 2001 A Space Odyssey?) seems more like wishful thinking: Instead of Stepford Wives we have Stepford iPhones, a man's depiction of the perfect woman: smart, organized, thoughtful, caring, understanding, always up for sex blah blah blah. To be fair, if the roles were reversed, we would see the same sort of thing.At times the movie is cute and clever, and Joaquin Phoenix (what is he? sexy nerd? adorable dork?) inhabits his role completely, as does Scarlet Johanssen (I suppose). Is it enough to sustain a whole movie? Not really. It would have made a better blog, or FaceBook post, or Twitter feed. The shorter the better."

1802663,B006ML9J4O,Worse than a regular touchpad thermostat,"My comments regarding the nest can be summed up in the email that I wrote to Nest, detailing SOME of my issues with their product:""Dear Nest,I've had two of your thermostats for many months now, so I've gotten to know them.  These are the reasons why I'm going to disconnect my Nest units and replace them with my old thermostats.  Hopefully you can learn from my comments to make your thermostat better.  It's VERY CLOSE to being great, but it needs work in several key areas.1)  The fan functionality is broken.  It detects my wire, but not the fan, and that's fine, but then it disables the ability to use the fan.  I know the fan works because Nest just uses a relay, and my system works with EVERY other thermostat I've plugged into it.  My problem is that the Nest programming disables the ability to use the fan if it doesn't sense voltage, even though it works properly without said voltage.  All I want is for Nest to activate its internal relay-- and it would work, but the programming is ""too smart"" for it's own good and disables something that would work perfectly fine, if it would just let me.  I'm an electrical engineer, and I know how easy and basic a relay is to deal with, and I know that it doesn't require voltage on the line to work.  There is nothing wrong with my wiring or my system, and yet Nest disables this feature because it doesn't sense voltage.  This was fine in the winter, because the fan activates as the blower for the heater, but now in the summer, this is driving me insane.2)  There is no 'circulate' functionality.  Yes, one of my Nests doesn't work with the fan, so this is sort of moot, but the other one does, so we'll just talk about that.  My old thermostat allowed me to activate the fan in circulation mode, which turned it on for 10-15 minutes an hour.  Why doesn't Nest allow me to do this basic function?!  On top of that, my old thermostat allowed me to schedule this circulation, which was fantastic for the summertime.  Again, Nest neither offers circulation OR the ability to schedule it.  Why not?!3)  The auto-programming is ineffective.  Over many months of using my Nest, it started getting less and less smart.  For example, I heat my house more on the weekends, and I turn my thermostat WAY down during weekdays.  One of the most heavily advertised features of the Nest is the ability to intelligently auto-program itself to such cyclical, predictive events.  Over the months, Nest started heating the house on the weekdays, to temperatures I had set on the weekend.  I NEVER set my thermostat to 70 on a tuesday mid-morning, for example, but all of a sudden it was heating to that because I had done so on a weekend.  Not only was this wasteful, it completely goes in the face of what auto-programming is supposed to do.4)  There's no summer mode.  I don't use AC, so I open my windows at night to cool my house during the summer.  BUT THEN NEST TURNS ON THE HEAT.  This is absolutely infuriating.  The only way around this, as far as I can tell, is putting nest permanently in AWAY mode, which completely eliminates the point in having it at all, and then if I go to force the fan on, it determines that I'm no longer away, transmits that to the other thermostat, which then turns on the heat, even though I don't want any heat and it's summertime.  So then I have to go and 'Away' that one as well.  What a pain!So, I'm planning on disconnecting both of my Nests.  I hope that the comments I've made help you to improve your product.  Once edited, these comments will be included in my review of your product, as I believe others would gain from my trials and tribulations with the Nest thermostat.  It's SO CLOSE to being great, but I just can't deal with it any longer.Thank you for your time.""I went back to my old Honeywell touchscreen thermostats and I couldn't be happier.  Nest just isn't ready for primetime."

NO BUBBLES! :) Just be careful of dust grains.*Like the title states, this is every bit as good as the iVisor, at less than half the price!Cons:*Perhaps the biggest con is that sunlight legibility is greatly diminished because of the matte material. The One's screen is AWESOME in direct sunlight, and with the screen protector it's still legible, just not nearly as bright.*It is easy to apply and reapply until you get the right application. But once it's settled, it is NOT easy to peel off.*Although these matte screens are described as being washable and re-applicable, once that adhesive element on the outer edges wear out, you can never apply it back again - it will simply not stick.*It does not cover the whole screen, since the capacitative buttons need to be free, so there is a weird cut-out at the bottom.Overall, a fine screen protector, and very worth the money!"

They find a retarded suspect (Benicio del Toro), and after his confesses, he commits suicide. Until there the movie is good. Retired Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) instantly thinks something is wrong, and he goes on the search. Then the movie goes off. Nothing else happens. You keep thinking something will happen, but nothing ever does. The ending is awful. Sean Penn had the knowledge and resources and a good story to make a good movie, but instead he makes an awful movie. The movie is slow. At the end we really don't know who murdered that girl, we get sort of an idea, but nothing for sure.

Removed the plastic pinch ""valve"" and put on the above brass, 3/8"" on/off valve.  This valve definitly seals better and may allow more flow as the hose isn't pinched at all anymore.

3587400,B000255MZG,Low PH aloe vera crashed the Ph in my tank and almost killed everything.,"I live where the water is so soft there's almost no minerals in it at all.  Maintaining a Ph of 7.0 was difficult but possible, but my snails had the white pitting and my guppy had fin rot that he contracted during the time when I was totally new to fish keeping and didn't understand how important it is to snails and guppies to keep the Ph at or above 7.0.I had finally got the situation under control.  My guppy's fins were regenerating and my snails had new shell growth that was healthy.Then I made the grave mistake of trying this product.  Aloe vera?  So what.  Looked like a stupid gimmick.  Since when do fish need aloe vera?  Do we need to pull them out of the tank and rub moisturizing cream on them too?  How about some Lubriderm?Anyway, shortly after switching to this product my Ph crashed to 6.0.  My guppy's fins started rotting and got worse than ever, and the healthy growth on my snails that survived me climbing the learning curve last Summer now have white calcified shell damage.  I don't even recognize the two I named just a few months ago!I was doing emergency water changes morning and evening just to keep the Ph at about 6.4.  (My tap water is totally soft, but comes out of the tap at PH of about 7.2).  My hands got raw and cracked because I was washing my hands so much after working with the tank so much.I asked myself what had changed when this started, and the only thing I came up with was switching to this aloe vera stress coat.  Then I looked up aloe vera juice on the Internet and found it has a Ph of 3.5 to 5.0 depending on where I looked.  Wow, I thought, maybe putting something with Ph that low in the tank could throw the whole Ph down quite a bit.I bought some Tetra brand stress coat and did a few more water changes (some cracks in hands bleeding now, maybe MY hands could use some aloe vera!!) and soon the Ph climbed back up to 6.8.I did two emergency salt dips for the guppy, whose fin rot had begun on his body too.  It looks like the rot has been halted.  The damage has been done to my snails.  Maybe once I get this under control I'll have time to just stare at the tank a while and figure out who is who again through all the shell damage.So, thanks API for putting my fish and snails through hell.  Brilliant idea mixing a super low Ph substance in with water conditioner.  Did you test this thoroughly before you put it into production?  Anyway, I could rant further but I think it's time to rub some Vaseline moisture lotion on my cloud fish.  They really need to chill out."

1767210,B002AKJ2FM,kreg prs7850,I placed a order for this item on 3 separate times. All 3 times I was sent the wrong item. All 3 times I was sent a Kreg self pin jig hole guide. Well that's how it goes when someone puts the wrong sticker on a item at Amazon.  Well I did buy this item from another place and it works great. There is no slop. The stop moves smoothly and you can read the tape through the window very well also. Excellent product.
1711254,B0002TG1GG,Great Idea but lots of perfection needed,"Being the first on the market I just had to have one. I like to buy everything new when it comes out. But man was I wrong to buy this right away. First, the motor is severely underpowered. Other reviewers have commented about it as well. It does conk out after about 3 feet and then requires the manual pull. Secondly the retract barely works. I mean I need to hammer my switch to get it to work. Third, this thing is huge and weighs a lot. I know its because of the motor and batteries, but still its too big.I own many Black and Decker tools and have been extremely satisfied over the years. This was a first attempt at a new product that didn't get as much testing as it needed. I'm sure that Black and Decker will try and improve this and make it better. It seems that everyone thats reviewed it has the same complaints. Have faith and trust in them to make it better over time!"
142552,B00ANALDWQ,Hole for lighting port too small for Apple's own adapter,"After going from the $10 Amazon case to this one, I'm going back to the Amazon Basics one. Why? Two reasons. The most important reason is that it doesn't work with Apple's own lighting-to-30-pin adapter. If you have an old accessory that needs the old style plug, you'll need to buy one of those. For some reason, the lighting end of those adapters is a bit thicker than the one that goes to a USB cord, and it doesn't even come close to fitting in the SPIGEN. Even the USB cord is a tight fit, but at least it works. A secondary reason is that the case doesn't fit all that well. It is rather loose, and the phone never seems to fully click in place. It's certainly not in danger of falling out, though, so I wouldn't dock it more than a star for it were it not for the cable incompatibility.If you know you'll never need an adapter cord, then by all means go for this case. It's not expensive, and for the price it's not a bad case my any measure. But if you think you'll need to ever use an old 30 pin device then this case just won't work. Maybe this is a small minority of people, but I'm going to give it a low review anyway because this is how the review system works: if people rate based on their subjective experience everything will work out in the average."

Their rendition had me sitting back on my heels, shocked and disturbed.""Angel Gabriel"" is an old gospel tune I have heard many times, but I very much enjoyed the rollick these two musicians added.""Joseph Hillstrom"" had me in tears.  Another little-heard song brought back to life.If you are a fan of groups like Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention, you're going to like the American equivalent here.  I also suspect we'll be hearing a lot more from this group and loving it!Rebecca Kyle, August 2009"

1833846,B000002GX2,"A Step Down, But Still Great","HOLD OUT is a step down from Jackson Browne's first five albums, but it's still a great CD. There are several excellent songs here, and only the opener, ""Disco Apocalypse"", is an outright dud. This inauspicious beginning, however, is forgivable, especially when you consider that Browne, like most other singer-songwriters, heartland rockers, California artists, and Southern boogie bands, believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was wrongfully convicted. That alone makes this an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience, even if a few songs are not quite up to the standard of Browne's 70s albums."
511871,B00CJBH5Y2,Great way to get more protein in your diet,"I&#8217;m a workout fanatic and I love training with heavy weights.  It&#8217;s hard to eat enough protein though.  This protein powder fits the bill.Why I like this product:* The Whey Protein Isolate is the best type of protein. The body absorbs it well.* It&#8217;s pretty much pure protein.  Each scoop provides 25 grams of protein.  There are no carbs and just 1 gram of fat.* It tastes good.  I love the vanilla flavor.  I can almost imagine that I&#8217;m drinking a vanilla milkshake.  Yes, the sucralose makes it a little sweet, but I didn&#8217;t mind that.* It mixes well.  You can mix it in a glass, in a shaker, or in a blender.  I workout in the morning and I am always rushed, so I don&#8217;t have to time to mess with a blender.  I love that I can just put some in a glass, mix with milk or juice and drink it.I&#8217;m not too keen on the artificial sweetener, sucralose.  But, pure protein needs something to make it palatable and this fits the bill."

Once a sale hit, I was all over them.The very first thing I noticed when I replaced the OEM blades on my 2013 Charger was how massive the brackets are. I didn't have any delusions about a universal-fit part looking like a contiguous part of my wiper arm, but seriously, the bracket on this is just huge.I appreciated how well-constructed the rest of the blade seemed to be, and that in spite of the gigantic bracket, the blade didn't wobble.

1678206,B00C7MGHVA,Terrible piney aftertaste,I don't drink coffee- but I have a Keurig for guests who do plus I do drink a fair amount of tea. I usually just use a teabag and use the Keurig to make my water hot for steeping unless I happen to be able to find my tea of preference in Kcup packaging.  I was interested in this one because while not a huge fan of green tea in general I thought that this one would be good to try since it seemed like it would be mild.It was mild and the kcups work fine- but the tea has a funky aftertaste to me that could only be described as tasting like pine. Lipton is the first brand of tea I started drinking. I have since branched out. I will stick with Twinings as this one stinks. I doubt I will be able to stomach the whole box.

3046562,B0018M6J90,Miss Pettigrew Should Have Stayed in Bed,"On the surface, it's easy to see why viewers might be drawn to the mindless diversion of ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"".  With the evening news broadcasting reports of never-ending atrocities in Africa and the Middle East, escalating crime woes in American cities, and devastating economic downturns, ""Miss Pettigrew"" offers a return to a different time and place, specifically the era of the British stiff upper lip in a London not yet affected by the Second World War.  In this world, fast-talking, loose-living theater folk emulate the characters in an Astaire/Rogers musical, flitting breezily from cocktail parties to fashion shows to jazzy nightclubs, while penniless spinsters cling to their dignity in soup lines.  By hook or by crook, everbody's looking for something better, but nobody is what they pretend to be; they're all about appearances, what's projected on the surface.  Which is the big problem with this movie.  ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"" is all about setting the mood for a particular place in time; it's about capturing the style of dialogue spoken in the frothy Hollywood screwball comedies of the thirties and early forties; it's about depicting a way of life that I'm not sure really existed outside the fevered imaginations of underpaid screenwriters.  But, underneath the gloss and high velocity chatter of ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"", there's nothing.  It's an empty, lovely vessel carrying such luminaries as Frances McDormand, Amy Adams, and Lee Pace across a sea of banality.To be sure, there is very little plot.  Miss Pettigrew, the middle-aged daughter of a vicar, has been let go from her latest job as a nanny (apparently, she tends to aid children in their misbegotten adventures).  Desperate, but ever-virtuous, the poor woman guiltily snatches a business card from the snooty woman at her temp agency, and immediately finds herself employed as the social secretary for a frivolous, ambitious, young actress named Delysia Lafosse.  Soon enough, Miss Pettigrew finds herself caught up in the frantic machinations of the actress and her social circle, as they struggle to attain starring roles, rich husbands, beautiful wives, fame, fortune, and whatever else that, to them, spells happiness.  The fact that Delysia has the habit of sleeping with different men puts her in an awkward situation that only Miss Pettigrew can help her with.  And thereby hangs the flimsy thread that serves as a plot for this silly trifle.Interestingly, although ominous hints of an approaching World War II surround the characters--there are already gas masks hanging in department store windows--there is very little actual concern demonstrated from anyone; they're all too worried about their next move, and to what extent they will benefit.  Appearances aside, they're really pretty dreadful people.As Miss Pettigrew, Frances McDormand is like an older, tireder Maria von Trapp, as she appeared in the first 20 minutes of ""The Sound of Music"" (though, thankfully, she doesn't sing).  She's exhausted by her penury but, unlike everyone else in the film, doesn't do much to improve her lot in life by, oh, applying some makeup or ditching the drab wardrobe, or attempting a little charm.  Even when her employer gives her a makeover, she's surprisingly dull and lifeless.  I suppose that's meant to convey a Mother Superior-like chasteness, to make us believe in Miss Pettigrew's moral superiority over her more earthy companions, but it just makes her seem unattractive and uninteresting.As the actress, Delysia Defosse, Amy Adams has a luminous quality that shines through even this ill-gotten mess.  Her Delysia's speech has the cadence of machine-gun fire and she's got the total self-absorption of a pampered cat; she's a pretty, peppy, resourceful tart with no more depth than a paper doll.Without exception, all the male characters are written as cuckholds or jerks (or both).  They're so one-dimensional that they barely exist; their only function seems to be providing the ladies with a place to hang their hats, if you will.  Lee Pace and Tom Payne, both young and handsome, are practically interchangeable as two of Delysia's suitors.  Their distinguishing traits are that the Pace character is poor and, therefore, has a pure love for Delysia, while the Payne character is rich, with, ultimately, less honest (and less pure) designs on the girl. Talented Ciaran Hinds is trotted out as fodder for Miss Pettigrew's well-hidden romantic yearnings, but he's no more believable than the rest of the cast.  Everyone in the considerably talented ensemble is totally wasted.At least you'd think they'd make pre-war London look good, but the cinematography is murky, and the few shots we get of the city are skimpy, as if there wasn't enough money left over after paying the cast to create convincing street scenes.  I've seen PBS Mystery do a better job recreating an older London in the Miss Marple series than the filmmakers here do.The people behind ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"" have assembled a lot of talent for their project, but they forgot to deliver a serviceable script, create believable characters, or to come up with anything that is, in any way, meaningful.  The sheer emptiness of this endeavor only serves to underscore the tremendous waste of talent, time, and money displayed here."

If you can't get to a service center (we are on an island) and send in just the motor for a rebuild they won't - for some reason- test it (how hard is clamping it to a bench?). So you stand to get the motor back still broken even if you tell service to ""replace all the bearings""."

Those songs definitely would have made this greatest album sell better. Don't get me wrong, the songs that are on this album are good, but these songs were not the reason that got him started and famous. Any fan of Snoop Dogg would agree with me when I say that this is a slap in the face of his fans. Not to mention a ""Pimp Slap'd""."
15694,B003ELOOZO,Great mount,My wife and I both have Motorola Droid X phones.  I bought 2 mounts as we have 2 cars.  Got this one and the Motorola brand dash mount.  The Motorola mount is nice that it puts the phone in to car mode automatically when you put the phone on it.  However I prefer this mount as I don't have to take the case off of the phone to use it and it will mount to the cars vent.  I have a suction cup plate on the dash but I am a little afraid of it coming off and the phone hitting something in the car that will crack the screen.  I don't have that fear with the vent mounting.  This is surprising good quality for the price.  Highly recommended.

150042,B00BIET580,Pretty good case for the price.,"I've been using this case for three months.  The outer cover is holding up well so far, however the plastic part that the phone snaps into has a few flaws. Firstly, it isn't exactly the perfect fit. From day one I could not fit the upper left corner of the phone so that it seats perfectly in the holder. A little bit of the upper left edge (bezel) is not secured as it should be. Second. the plastic slots near the two side phone buttons are very thin, and are easily broken when trying to remove the phone from the case. This has already happened to me. Thirdly, the top and bottom of the phone are not protected by any part of the case. If you happen to drop your phone on the top or bottom, it could be damaged or marred. The case looks good and all buttons, speakers, mics, sensors, cameras, USB and headphone ports are accessible. It also protects the screen very well as there is a stiff card (probably plastic) of some kind sewed into the front cover. It will certainly protect your phone from keys etc. in your pocket, but may not be as protective as some other covers out there."

That's true because 1) it's not cheap per pound and 2) you'll use quite a bit more than you expect per cup of tea, coffee, etc.Next (and last), it irritated my throat.  For me, at least, that ""cooling"" sensation that most everyone else has mentioned also resulted my throat being sore while I drank my tea and for a short while thereafter.It was worth a try but not worth repeating."

Secondly,  the actual song selection is stunningly terrible.  The group's later period  wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't good enough that you'd want to clutter  HALF THE CD with songs from their last two albums!  Then we have two songs  from Seven and two from The Rise and Fall--decent enough selections;  perhaps if ALL their albums were thus represented this would be better.  Unfortunately, they're not--Absolutely is entirely ignored, and all we have  from One Step Beyond is the title track.  It also has the non-album single  It Must be Love, but as that's found on the infinitely better self-titled  compilation, that's no excuse to buy this.  And, of course, the track order  shows no rhyme and reason at all (One Step Beyond, LAST?).  All in all,  even though it includes some good songs, this is absolutely (not a pun)  inexcusable.  Buy Madness--it was released while the group was still  around, so it's not entirely authoritative, but it includes work from their  best period, INCLUDING the excellent House of Fun, which you won't find  anywhere else this side of the Atlantic.

1874616,B000H7JDVI,Beautiful Bookend,"On September 19th, Elton and his longtime musical partner Bernie Taupin released the highly anticipated sequel to Elton's 1975 masterpiece Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy, appropriately titled The Captain And The Kid. The album is a throwback to his early recordings (which I consider his finest) from the early to mid 70's. Just for the record, the 1975 landmark album ""Captain Fantastic"" was the very first album to debut at #1, and five months later it was followed by Elton's Rock Of The Westies which was the second album in history to top the charts in its debut week. Elton has been the most consistent male recording artist of the music industry for the past four decades.The first single, ""The Bridge,"" has already made history as Elton's 66th charted Adult Contemporary single in Billboard, which is more than any other artist. He's just ahead of Barbra Streisand, who owns 64 charted singles. Elton is also tied with The Carpenters with 15 #1 singles on the AC charts. ""The Bridge"" debuted at a respectful #29 and returned him to the sound that made him famous with the debut of ""Your Song"" in December 1970. ""The Bridge"" is destined for the Top 10, and is so good I wouldn't be surprised to see it at the top of the totem pole.The entire album finds John in familiar territory, as this album could've easily been released in the 70's - and that's a good thing! Elton scored his greatest success not only chart-wise but critically with his early material. The fact that he didn't feel the need to give this album an updated sound adds more credibility to Elton the artist and to the quality of this album. Who says you need synthesizers and a heavy bassline nowadays to have something worth your fifteen bucks? The fact that this album boldly picks up where ""Captain Fantastic"" left off, and sounds as if it was the immediate follow-up, is not only brilliant, it's sheer heaven to my ears.The opening track, ""Postcards From Richard Nixon,"" has the familiar piano introduction, the profound Taupin lyrics and gorgeous harmonies that put Elton on the map all those years ago. Track 2, ""Just Like Noah's Ark,"" has the same honky tonk piano feel of his 1972 album, Honky Chateau, that contains some of the best mid-tempo rocking this man has accomplished in over a decade.With close to 50 albums to his name, it's hard not to compare this material to his best, and believe me, this is his best since his mid 90's outing Made In England. Comparisons were definitely hard to escape on the track ""Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way (NYC),"" which is so reminiscent of his splendid composition ""Levon,"" that I had to play it twice before moving on.  ""And The House Fell Down"" is another track that starts off nostalgically and builds to a piano tempo that runs parallel with the 1972 jump of ""I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself"" to the 80's staple beat of ""I'm Still Standing."" Halfway through the album finds the ballad ""Blues Never Fade Away"" that could've easily been lifted from his earliest recordings. I relished listening to tracks such as ""Tinderbox,"" ""I Must Have Lost It On The Wind"" and ""Old 67"" because they all brought me back to John's glory days. The title track, which is also the closer, is an homage to himself, referencing his past recordings such as ""Tumbleweed Connection,"" his ""Rocket Man"" status, the brilliance of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"" ""Rock Of The Westies"" and of course, the prequel ""Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy."" The track is most fitting considering the life Elton has led and the music he has delivered for almost 40 years.If you have ever been a fan of Elton's early years or even his later work, you cannot go wrong with this CD. There's not a bad song in the bunch. John has attempted to go back to his ""roots"" several times in the past few years with albums such as 2001's Songs From The West Coast and 2004's Peachtree Road, but as good as some of the tracks were, the albums lacked cohesiveness. In the past decade, Elton's concentration on his Broadway and London musicals may have distracted him from making the kind of full album that made his music so consistently rich to begin with. This time around the marriage of Elton's music and Taupin's lyrics has returned Sir Elton to the royal kingdom that started it all when he chanted ""I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind"" all those years ago. No, Elton, when it's this good, we don't mind at all."

1854456,B00004U2G4,Hmmm -- really not that special.  Surprisingly bad.,"Well I loved Eric Clapton's Blues Breakers album, I thought Jeff Beck's &quot;Blow By Blow&quot; showed genius and I had heard that this album was a raw early classic.  Even with Rod Stewart on vocals I didn't think this album was very special at all. Green Sleeves and Old Man River -- come on!  Disappointing (sorry -- but he did call it Truth after all) :(."
1853476,B00004S51Y,Perfect,"If there really is no such thing as perfect, then ""The Very Best Of Cat Stevens"" is as close as you can get to a perfect compilation.Cat Stevens was one of the most successful artists of the early 1970s' singer/songwriter movement. His mellow, acoustic based hit singles still remain classics today. And they're all here on this neatly packaged, digitally remastered, 20 song collection. Those hits include ""The First Cut Is The Deepest"", ""Wild World"", ""Hard Headed Woman"", ""Morning Has Broken"", ""Moonshadow"", ""Peace Train"", ""Peace Train"", ""Sitting"", ""Oh Very Young"", ""Another Saturday Night"" and ""(Remember The Days Of The) Old School Yard"". Also, many underrated gems including the previously unreleased ""I've Got A Thing About Seeing My Grandson Grow Old"". And the sound quality is excellent.The oackaging, as I said, is beautiful. The liner notes make for a great read. An essential album for your record collection."
1588740,B001EQ55ZO,These are a miss,I love cashews and was looking forward to trying these. Unfortunately to my palate they have way too much salt and pepper.

I did taste it though, it's HORRIBLE and spit it in the sink, the aftertaste is hard to get rid of even if you don't swallow it. This can has a whopping 66 grams of sugar which would have put me in a sugar coma for a day, hardly something that would give anyone long term energy just a big fat sugar crash. It doesn't even taste good, so why would anyone put this crap in their body? It has lots of caffeine and 260 empty calories per can. There are supposedly two servings per can so if you down this whole can know that you double all the amounts on the label. There is no good reason to consume this stuff."

3656238,B0018N38P2,Ok,"I was happy to try a new type of scratcher for my two VERY active kitties. Unfortunately it was destroyed in one evening. I thought they would enjoy the incline and make it easier to scratch but it is far too light weight and the angle seems to make it tip over when they use it. The height seems to play against the sturdiness of it as well. Before I knew it, it was tipped over and ripped apart - catnip everywhere! Also the &#34;toy&#34; it says it comes with was a crinkled tissue paper like ball which of course was destroyed in a few minutes. As of 2 days after we received it it now lays without the toy, without the box and without the fun toy hide hole. I will not be wasting my money on this again. I will stick to the simple flat laying scratchers for my active kitties!"

3670724,B001ZWJL1Q,beware of NEW DESIGN!,"Bags on Board changed the design of their bags. instead of clean straight lines, and adequate perforation markings to separate them (been using for over 1 1/2 yrs and not a single ""tear"")... they now have a deeply rounded end on the bottom and 'tie' pieces on the top. however, to get this shape, they compromised on quality. the perforation markings to NOT perform, and the bag tears when you try to separate it (EVERYtime so far!!). you can totally forget about using the convenient dispensers anymore!! 1st time i used this 'new & improved' design, i got a thumb full of poo!HORRIBLE!! simply awful -- and now i'm stuck with 21 rolls of UNusable bags!!update -- turns out the seller sent me the WRONG bags. i ordered ""regular"" and they sent me ""easy tie"" bags instead. and because i still had bags from my previous stash (and we had a very snowy-cold winter... no poo pickup til the thaw), i didn't begin using this purchase until today. these have the TERRIBLE design, they're thinner, the seams don't hold and they tear when try to separate!it's past the ""amazon"" return date... i wrote the seller and am hoping they'll do an exchange because of the error in sending my the wrong product.so, still BEWARE!! i ordered 'regular' bags (which have been great!!), but they sent me ""easy tie"" which are completely USELESS!!"
1303601,B008TNAG4A,The pitch shifting is out of tune,"If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that.  As an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful.  All the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp. This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect.  I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it.  It's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is.  I've read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also. This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good.  I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and I'm also tempted to get their Green Mile pedal.If you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.One minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals.  It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips I've tried to use."

1879962,B002HQWQB6,3.5 Stars - Pleasant and very listenable,"""Sunshower"" is my first exposure to Jupiter One, and it's definitely been a pleasant one. This is definitely the least edgy album I've heard in a long time, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes one is in the mood for some nice, non-confrontational music and this album fits the bill. It has a nice flow with enough variety to keep things interesting.The album has a nice live band feel, which I find missing from so many records these days. It doesn't suffer from overproduction and you get the feeling that these guys probably sound just as good in a live show. The instrumental parts aren't particularly virtuosic, but then again, that's not really what this music about. It's about the construction of nice, simple songs.My main criticism is that with so many similar-sounding groups out there, Jupiter One doesn't do much to differentiate itself. The experience of listening to ""Sunshower"" is one you could get from a number of different bands. That said, if you're a fan of upbeat, positive, and tuneful indie rock, this will not disappoint.I'm not particularly enamored with the album, but it has enough staying power that I return to it occasionally. It's enjoyable and puts you in a good mood. Check out some MP3 samples first, but if you like what you hear, you'll get more of the same. There's always something to be said for positive, uplifting music."

3747813,B000E7WLJW,Oversize Hefty trash bag,"You'll notice that all the five star reviews go back a couple of years when this bag was obviously made of nylon/canvas and was a quality product.  Since then, the manufacturer has changed it into a cheap piece of plastic material that looks for all the world like a large, and admittedly reinforced, Hefty bag.  It's plastic inside and out with some type of reinforcing fiber woven through it.  Feels like it's about 6-7mil thick.  The accompanying warnings about adding a down piece to your tailpipe should be well heeded because even with the exhaust 7-8 inches away, it will melt this product.Speaking of melting, I have serious doubts about the durability of this product in extreme cold - it will either become too stiff to work with or crack, neither a desirable outcome.  About the only good thing I can say is that it is obviously waterproof with a good zipper system built into it.  Unfortunately, I had to keep it because I actually took it out of the box, thinking that maybe the inside was canvas and they had moved the plastic coating to the outside for better weather protection.  Well, once it's out of the box and opened, I  defy any normal human to roll it back up to the size to fit back in the box!Oh, and the picture of the box it came in is not representative of what is inside the box.  So, Amazon is simply using the advertising literature provided by the manufacturer although they should still remove it from their inventory (or sell it for the $25 it's obviously worth).  Find yourself a higher quality product that will last for more than a few trips and if it costs a little more, in the end it will be worth it.  Unfortunately for me, this is one of the very few products that is the correct size for my rear hitch carrier.Late edit:While the product remains questionable, Amazon came through in their typical customer oriented fashion and made it good with me.  They also promised to look into the issues with the item and delete it from their inventory if appropriate."
3285760,B004EPYZPS,boring and offensive,"Another movie where the government is the bad guy. The monster, which kills people and hangs them upside down, however, is just misunderstood.

1360383,B0009JB4IY,Don't like it,"This is a game for kids under the age of 13.

You can only use him as part of storymode.  I've been a huge spidey fan for well over 10 years but this game was a total letdown.  If you're still in middle school you might like it.

1476575,B004HYK8Y8,Why is anyone still buying this? IT DOESN'T WORK!,"If I didn't buy this on launch day, I would never consider buying it with review after review and article after article describing the game-breaking glitches on the PS3 version of the game. I can't believe this title -- the PS3 version -- is still in the top 100. Oh, how I loathe this game's glitches and how I now loathe Bethesda -- in the past, my favorite developer.Not only did my Skyrim saves all become corrupted after freezing a billion times -- my PS3's HDD was destroyed by Skyrim. Literally everything on the hard drive was corrupted and the HDD needed to be replaced. The guy at Sony said he never had calls for broken HDD's until Skyrim. He said that is now the # 1 reason people call tech support.If you buy this game for the PS3, you have my word it will not work. It may take 10 hours to break. It may take as many as 35. But it will break. And there's a chance it will corrupt your PS3's HDD as well -- because when it freezes you need to physically shut the PS3 off and do a hard reset (sometimes it freezes so bad even pressing the power button doesn't turn the console off and you have to unplug it with the game frozen and disc still spinning).If you buy the game this will happen:First, it will stutter and have frame-rate issues.Second, it will start freezing up and freezing your PS3.Third, it will start moving so slow you cannot play -- literally 5 or 6 frames a second (there are tons of videos on YouTube showing this).Fourth, you'll clear your cache and try again.Fifth, if you experience what I did, the game will finally freeze and corrupt ALL saves on your PS3.Skyrim felt like a fun game during the first 10 hours while it worked. There was definite potential. It was WAY too close to Oblivion for comfort and basically felt like a remake, but Oblivion was a great game and I didn't mind the fact there was nothing new -- outside of the occasional giant or dragon -- in Skyrim. I considered buying another copy for my 360, but I cannot bring myself to pay for this game again when it has damaged my PS3 and when I already paid sixty for it on launch day.Bethesda should be ashamed, should be apologizing publicly to all PS3 owners who spent their hard earned money on this title and should be issuing a RECALL. This game is NOT fit to be sold. Bethesda knowingly sold a broken game. I will never buy another Bethesda title again. I no longer trust them. If you've played this on a PS3, you no longer trust them. If you buy this and have all these things happen, you will stop trusting them, too. What this company did wasn't just unethical -- it was devious. They hire game testers. They obviously knew it was broken. Yet they claimed, time and again, that the PS3 and 360 versions were virtually ""identical."" All that mattered to Bethesda was setting sales records. Not releasing a game that worked.Please, do yourself a favor and save your cash and your PS3. There is a 100% chance this game will eventually stop working. If anyone posts below saying they played for 300 hours without a glitch? They are lying (most likely Bethesda employees hoping to avoid a class action lawsuit). There is far more than anecdotal evidence that this game just doesn't work on the PS3.I am sick about this. It's inexcusable. Bethesda -- PLEASE do the right thing and recall this game and issue a full refund to those who want it or a credit for another game you publish for those who want something else.Here are a few tips that may help delay the game's breaking:1. Never play online. Ever. Make sure your Ethernet cable is unplugged and WiFi is disabled.2. Turn off ALL auto-saving (which is a huge headache, as it's hard to remember to save constantly on your own and you may end up finding yourself an hour or two back if you are killed in the game or if the game freezes without being saved). Turning off ALL auto-saving (it auto-saves on fast travel, on rest and on sleeping) reduces the freezing by about 50%.3. Take the game out of your PS3 and use it as a coaster for drinks as you play RELIABLE games released by COMPETENT and ETHICAL companies.If this review saves even one person from buying this broken game, I've been of help. There are a TON of great games right now for all 3 major consoles and for the PC. More than you could play in the next year. Why even flirt with buying the one that was released broken? There are too many good developers who took the time to make sure their games WORKED out of the box. Bethesda hasn't even fixed the game with a patch (the patch they did release actually broke it further). I doubt they ever will. Shame."
3755891,B0032DBQHS,I should have returned it,"I think this is is a dumb design. You have to put the key in and turn and turn and turn and turn. What it does is unthread on a small diameter bolt, maybe 1\4""? I get the impression that I need to put some silicone on it before using it to keep it from corroding and rusting. It will probably work fine to keep the hitch in the receiver, but not convenient and I doubt these small threads would survive a good pry bar. JMHO"
2274635,6303917410,Avert your eyes,"Although it's called Amityville II this dreadful little movie is supposed to be a prequel about the first family to move into the cursed house. Unlike the Lutz's as played by James Brolin and Margot Kidder this family has nothing going for it. The father is a lout who smacks the kids around. The mother is a passive aggressive weeper and their oldest kid, Sonny is simmering with rage. In other words, these unpleasant people really don't need a demon they're doing a pretty good job of spreading the misery around by themselves. By the time Sonny turns green and starts shooting the family you're really, really ready for him to get on with it so this wretched flick can finally end.Bottom line: it's nowhere near as good or as fun as the original and as other reviewers have pointed out, it's mostly a rip off of the Exorcist."

If she needs to struggle with operating the device she will not use it. If she needs to turn it on and off, she will likely skip it... Also making and receiving call should be super easy and simple.Well I'm glad to say the Tour does all of the above: it turns on and off automatically, pairing is super easy with her iphone 4 and my iphone 5 (and they can both be connected at the same time!), making and receiving calls is super easy and the best thing is that sound quality is excellent. I have talked to my wife while she was driving and I could not believe she was on the speakerphone. She could hear me very well too.I've had a number of speakers and headset, and this is by far the best one in terms of call sound quality.We've also used this with a navigation software on the phone and it worked well.I did not give this device 5 stars though because of the relatively high price and because I feel that some features are not 100% &#34;on the money&#34;. For once, it did not announce callers as it was supposed to. I'm still looking into this. Also, when connecting two phones it got a little confused and disconnected one of them for no apparent reason. I will update this review if anything changes.The bottom line though is the great call quality on both sides and the ease of use. The product also looks nice and is very well finished.

3758580,B004UQQYAK,Does a great job on steel and chrome,"Griot's Garage started life as a web-based ""petrol head"" web site. The owner - a car collector himself - only sold products that his company either designed or discovered and came with Griot's personal stamp of approval. My friends in the Ferrari club are regular users of Griot's Garage goods and nobody cares more for their cars than the Tifosi! High praise indeed.My daily driver - an Audi A3 - has twin chrome tail pipes that are always turning black from the exhaust. I have tried several polishes but none gave me the cleanliness and shine I wanted. I crawled under the back of the Audi and started to polish away. I squeezed a small bit onto the tail pipe and then wrapped a soft cloth around it. It took only a few minutes to turn a dark and dirty tail pipe into the cleanest part of the car. Sweet! (Until I realized I now had to wash the whole car to make things even...)I next used the paste on a stainless steel knife blade. It had a few spots from the dishwasher (tiny circles of rust) and with a brisk rub, they disappeared quickly. Of course, I throughly washed the knife afterward because the warning on the tube says the paste is toxic!Finally, I gave our chrome kitchen faucet a quick polish. It did a great job on the dull finish but did not have much of an impact on some calcium deposits (not its fault...)Summary - This paste worked well on steel and chrome. It did not have an offensive odor (a lot of these products smell or ammonia) and it doesn't scratch the surface if used on a clean surface and with a soft cloth.Recommended."

1673433,B00A64NLOM,Werther's Original Baking Caramel,Werther's makes some of the best tasting hard candies so when I saw this I figured it had to be just as good.....not so...I didn't like it at all. It tasted the way candy tastes after it has sat around for about 6 months or more. I won't use it on my caramel apples. I'll make it from scratch as always. This just does not taste like caramel. Really disappointing.

1946516,0783227981,"""No more alcohol or sedatives in HER Life""","I saw Fletch Lives first, when I was just 9, and it really appealed to my sense of humor at the time (and my sense of humor now too, I guess). It was easily accessible for a kid, but I was originally disappointed when I first saw Fletch because it was more serious and a lot of jokes just went over my head.As a result Fletch appeals to the adult in me while Fletch Lives appeals to the kid barely concealed inside. There's loads of great one-liners from our man Chase and even if that doesn't float your boat Harold Faltermeyer's score is just plain awesome. It's unfortunate that ""Irwin F"" never became as famous or iconic as ""Axel F"".I've read the book, and it's as different as it is similar to the plot of the movie, except for one major difference; Fletch's cases are not connected in the book but they are in the movie. Gregory MacDonald had the final say on who they cast as Fletch and rejected Burt Reynolds (no way) and Mick Jagger (say what???) before approving Chase. Along with Clark W. Griswold he's his most famous character (Ty Webb coming in at 3rd place).It's not aged so well though, the film is clearly very 80s, unlike the sequel which doesn't use any pop songs, But even if the pop tunes anchor this in 1985 it's still one of the best comedies of that decade and no one can call themselves a film buff without owning/watching.The Blu Ray features a 1080p 1.85:1 picture but since much of the film has a rather drab color pallet only a few nicely-shot scenes look good. The DTS-HD MA sound really brings Faltermeyer's score to life though. Extras do not feature Chase and are in standard definition."

1863024,B00008H2LB,Linkin Park &#65533; Mediocrity,"This album treads most of the same ground that Hybrid Theory already explored.  Needless to say that ground is the radius of a dime.  The music plays the same format over and over, from a distance it sounds like Hybrid Theory.Who can blame Linkin Park for sticking with what works?  As long as it keeps them on top, musical development can take a back seat to musical progression.  For those that liked the previous effort Meteora makes a good companion.  For those hoping the band would become other than a highly popular flash in the pan, the jury is out."
1310396,B00002STYR,bad fighting,"I had a friend who used to come over and make fun of me for owning Killer Instinct.  He'd constantly ask me ""when are you going to get rid of this crappy game?"" and I'd tell him ""oh, eventually"".  But it took until 2001 when the game didn't sell at a yard sale that I ended up throwing it in the trashbin . THAT is when I got rid of it for good.The fighting in Killer Instinct is even worse than in Mortal Kombat, and I didn't think it was possible to defeat Mortal Kombat in sheer crappiness.  The one thing Killer Instinct does better than MK is the combo system.  It's easier and more enjoyable to unleash combos to your opponent in this game.  Unfortunately, just like Mortal Kombat, the fighting system is severely dated and useless by todays standards.  Unless you like your fighting games to be in slow-motion along with neverending choppy graphics (with bad-looking fatalities included for additional pain- pain that YOU feel) you should never ever think about buying this game.  Just another Super NES fighting game I hope people can't remember."
1864531,B0000AGWFX,The future of popular music and its name is OUTKAST!,"Not being an avid fan of rap music, I find myself being drawn to the sound of Atlanta's own Outkast. The duo's sound is an eclectic blend of George Clinton/Bootsy Collins-inspired 70's P-funk, the 50's jazzy sound of Miles and Quincy, the eroticism and intricacies of Prince, the sophistication of the Motown Sound, the frenzy of a Sunday morning gospel choir, and even the exhuberant and playful rock of the 60's.While staying true to their hip-hop roots, Andre 3000 and Big Boi have branched out and produced a release that appeals to both the teens, their parents and their grandparents, even with the abundance of ""expletives"" and sexual references.Buoyed by the strength of the two current chart favorites, ""The Way You Move"" and ""Hey Ya"", ""Speakerboxx/The Love Below"" is a hip-hop tour de force that, come Grammy Award night, should rival Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" in the statue department!"
1297731,B0009G1E0K,Decent strap - not for tall people though,"If you need a simple, normal-length strap, this should work fine.  However, if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side, this is not what you need.  I bought this but wound up ordering theErnie Ball 4037 Black Polypro Strapinstead.  Very similar look and feel, but the Ernie Ball is MUCH longer.  The lowest I could get this to hang was just above my waist.  Again, not a bad strap, just not for us tall guys :)"

I liked it a lot but it was a little bulky so I went for a slimmer model this time; the Explorer 330. FORGET IT! It won't stay in my ear. It makes my ear so sore that I can hardly force myself to wear it (I have to have it for my job) and if I get four feet away from my cell, I get static. I'm VERY disappointed with this model and will be returning it."
1883191,B006VE678S,More like Port of Sorrow (The downfall of the Shins!),"Fist off I gotta say I am a  huge fan of the Shins and have been since I  heard ""Oh Inverted World ""years ago. I use to listen to that album for months on end all the time like it was going out of style.  It was such a lovely and interesting album that I got lost in. "" Chutes too narrow"" was also a great album.  Although I was not fanatical about"" Wincing....Away"" it had a few really cool and kick butt rock songs on there.It's hard to believe that The Shins who created such amazing songs like: The past and the pending, new slang, the celibate life, the weird divide, know your onion, those to come, the gloating sun, we built a raft, and sphagnum esplanade to name but just a few of the amazing songs they created actually  produced this album. And it took them more than an entire half a decade to do so...oh geez. Were they sleeping for four and a half years and decided to put out a shot gun album just to shut up fans. I don't know.I will say this album has an entirely different sound than the previous three albums.  Almost all of the songs are completely unengaging and skip worthy.  I listened to this album a few times to let it sink in as I always do before reviewing an album.  But still nothing clicked at all. It was truly painful to listen to. Almost all of the songs sound the same and have a monotone Mercer and monotone instrument playing throughout. The self titled album song ""Port of Morrow"" sounds like one of the band members(doesn't sound like Mercer though it could be) try exceptionally hard to try to emulate and sound like John Lennon and I have no idea why. Either way that song falls flat on its face as do almost all of the other tracks.The only redeeming song that I thought was quite lovely is ""For a Fool"", but even that could not save this album.  The song ""simple song ""is so-so.One thing I could not help but notice and bothered me with this album is  how unbelievably corny and cheesy the lyrics of almost all of the songs are. It's almost as if a teenager wrote these songs and handed them over to Mercer to sing.  Or maybe Mercer is trying to appeal to a teenage like audience who's more impressionable buying awful music.  These are not the interesting, cool, intriguing, eccentric, beautiful lyrics that were found on ""Oh Inverted World"" or ""Chutes too Narrow"", uh-uh. Afterall most of the people who grew up with the Shins are now in their 20s, 30s, and older. Let the lyrics appeal to that genre of people please. You would think as musicians get older they would hone their skills and be better song writers and musicians.  This album, however, seems to go way backwards-I mean way backwards. I don't know what happened to the James Mercer and the Shins from"" Oh Inverted World"" but I want them back. So James please get back to your cool interesting song writing- please man for the sake of good music before you tarnish the Shins reputation and give them a bad name.I read that Mercer got rid of the other band members which is insane.  It is clearly reflected in this album for sure.  And all this time if I had to guess I would have thought that it was Mercer who more or less carried the amazing sound of The Shins(the original shins that is), but after listening to this album I think it's the other way around.Hey I am not trying to diss the Shins I love these guys, but I feel this album is truly a disgrace and a slap in the face of fans who have been waiting eagerly for their next album(I was not one of those fans but still), especially considering how talented you know The Shins are.  This album is just lame-o-rama.  Fortunately this album is not very long at all, and I did not buy the album but downloaded the songs for free as I suggest you do the same and not waste your money.I liked two tracks out of 10 which reduces to 1/5th. Therefore one star rating."

1674587,B00AQIT8XG,Decent but flavors are weak,"Bunnery Natural Foods Pancake Mix Sampler are decent but the flavors are very light, to light in my opinion.  The worst one of them was the blueberry not because it tasted bad or anything but because the flavor was so light you would almost taste the blueberry then it was gone.The mixes are pretty straight forward.  They tend to be a little dry if you follow the directions so add a little more milk.  This will thin them out but the batter will go farther and they will be moister.  They are also not for those that have an issue with texture as the grains are not finely milled.  These really don't compare the the pancake at their restaurant but they are a good healthy alternative to the other mixes out there."

1897894,0767812778,One Of The Ten Most Magnificent Films Of All Time!,"No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as ""Bridge Over the River Kwai"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" """"Ryan's Daughter"", and of course, ""Lawrence  of Arabia""(see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography is always  spectacular and breath-taking, and one has to agree with the comments of a  previous reviewer that here the desert plays a well-scripted supporting  role in the unfolding drama that was T. E. Lawrence's experience during the  First World War in Arabia. Lean always focused his films on the ways in  which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with  the larger social, cultural, and historical surround in which they are  located, and so each film is a particularly captivating study of the  specific dynamics of each such situation. Each of these films is also a  well-choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate,  and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The  eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays.Here young and  bookish Lawrence is faced with the unenviable and unlikely prospect of  trying to unite the multitude of Arab Bedouin tribes in support of the  Allies in the regional warfare associated with WWI. The film captures this  unlikely and somewhat quixotic personal odyssey most memorably, and a very  young Peter O'Toole is masterful in his edgy portrayal of the enigmatic  Lawrence as a time-trapped romantic caught by whimsy and circumstance in  the most mind-boggling adventure of a lifetime, an adventure that broke all  the rules of convention and upper-class British expectations.He meets  his match with other characters played by Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and  Sir Alec Guinness. And in capturing the comically mismatched skills,  expectations, and romanticism that Lawrence launched into the larger  picture of what was going on, by viewing his personal odyssey in the  context of the much larger cultural framework of Arab ambitions,  jealousies, and cultural differences, we are magically transported into the  strange and marvelous world of the desert and all the romance and mystery  of that region.  Viewing each of David Lean's splendid and classic films  is a treat and a privilege; no one was as prolific, as consistent, and as  engaging a storyteller as he. Lawrence of Arabia is one of his finest  films, and as such represents a wonderful standard of excellence in  storytelling and film experiences. Sit down and relax, for you are in a  master's hands. Enjoy!"

1298335,B000EEJJI6,A less convenient way to get the job done.,"Works great, but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.Some responses to comments I've seen in the reviews:--I've had mine for 5 years, used moderately, and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible. Haven't put a pad there or anything.--The manual screw functionality does, I feel, give an added level of control...you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz.--However, range of motion is on the wide side. To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic, I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string, and screw it down all the way, and it does sometimes leave some buzz.The price is nice though, so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo."
1295219,B0002E1O2M,destroyed my guitar,I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them.
3746167,B000BQSIWK,Very Disappointed & Returned,I tried to charge my car battery and it showed 12v at 40% so after four hours it showed 12v at 100%. I removed the cables and after 30 minutes it showed 12.1v at 52% and after two hours it was at 100%. Let it sit again and it was 12.3v at 71%. I tested the voltage at times while charging and it never went above 12.5v. I do not believe that this is a reliable charger so I returned it for a older model SE-5212A. I have used Midtronics products so I understand the microprocessors and there quirks but nothing beats the old tried and true charges that have metal cases and transformers. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this it's junk. P.S it's 3/12 Amp not 3/6/12 Amp. This charger works if you have a battery that is weak but if your battery is under 9 volts you have to keep unplugging it and start over and over until it reaches a threshold to maintain it. The cooling fan does not run all the time and the unit over heats and then I would have to let it cool down and start over again.

193802,B00KB9AWEE,Well designed case - not too bulky,"This case provides a good, medium level of phone protection without too much bulk. You can easily keep the phone in your pocket, like I do, without feeling like you have a brick in your pocket.It took me a few minutes to figure out how the case worked when I opened the box. The inner case comes inserted into the outer case, so you have to figure out how to take them apart before you can put your phone in the inner case. Just peal the outer (rubber) case at the corners and pry back to remove. The rest was very easy.Changing the colored protective cover on the back was a bit difficult, but they do snap on securely and that's not something you'll have to do often. I love the built in screen protector! The buttons work well and the overall fit is quite good."

She sounds refreshed and overall it's an enjoyable album start to finish."

I never have to wait for my phone to charge because I always have fully charged batteries.  The charger has a usb power outlet so I can charge other devices as well (saving even more travel space). The plug folds tidily away so it doesn't get in your way when you have to pack light.  The charging indicator light is a red or blue strip along the bottom that is easy to see."
3306519,B004MV47WK,Badly directed adaptation of Chekov's novella,"Sadly for me, The Duel is a film which looks good on the screen, but unfortunately is a badly directed adaptation of Anton Chekov's fine novella of the same name.  The director, Dover Koshashvili, portrays Laevsky, the central character in the novella, as a nasty, brutish lout whose bizarre behavior is as unaccountable to the other characters in the film as it is to the viewer. He has left St. Petersburg for a small town on the Black Sea with another man's wife.  He discovers that he does not love this woman, Nadya, and wants to leave her and return to St. Petersburg.  He tries to borrow money from a local doctor, who in turn asks a zoologist, Van Koren, for the rubles.  Van Koren hates Laevsky and tries to persuade the doctor to convince Laevsky to take Nadya with him when he leaves.  When Laevsky comes to ask for the money, he insults the doctor and Van Koren uses this provocation to challenge Laevsky to fight a duel.  Those that wish to see this film can discover the outcome of the duel for themselves.As noted, director Koshashvili's mishandling and misunderstanding of the main character make it difficult for the viewer to make much sense of the story.  All the other characters in the film have the same problem as the viewer; they watch Laevsky's antics with some astonishment, not knowing what to make of his behavior, and yet they tolerate him.  Almost as confusing and equally unsatisfying is the treatment of Nadya, the woman who has left her husband for Laevsky.  The director has little understanding of what motivates her as she interacts with Laevsky and the other characters in the film. In Chekov's novella, Nadya plays a small, but important role.  In Koshasvili's film she is a central character and has many scenes unnecessary to the development of the story.After viewing the movie I went back to Chekov's novella to determine if there was some confusion in his telling of his story and his treatment of his characters.  The story, translated by the reliable Constance Garnett, is crystal clear and beautifully told.  Laevsky and Nadya are complicated human beings.  Chekov is so skillful and great a writer that we slowly begin to understand these truly unhappy and pitiful people.  I recommend the novella, not the film."
1298892,B000NGVQKO,Very Good Finger Picks!,"I decided to try these open metal finger picks when I could no longer find ProPicks, which I really like.  ProPick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar.  Compared with the ProPicks these are manufacturer from a heavier, stiffer metal.  They offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger.  I find these (and the ProPicks, for that matter) much more natural than conventional picks.  These actually have some advantages over the old ProPicks: (1) you get three finger picks, rather than two; and (2) because the metal is a heavy gauge, they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers.  It would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that they're protected in the guitar case; however, they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well free-ranging around in the case.  Highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar."
3661231,B001F2I9YG,My dogs eat it but it's nothing special to them...,I have 2 chihuahuas and they'll both eat this food but you can tell it's nothing special to them.  If it's a food they really like they'll take a few bites right after I'm finished filling up their bowl.  With this food they'll smell it and then they'll walk away.  They'll eat later on when they get hungry.The food looks and smells like your typical dog food.  Nothing special that makes it stand out.  I do like the fact that it's made with real chicken and vegetables and has no fillers.  I don't like the bag that the food comes in.  It's too thin which is making it start to get little holes and tears in it from usage.Overall I think this food is a pretty good choice but it's nothing that my dogs are jumping with joy over.  I would recommend trying it though.

It's GREAT to be able to have pressure on both the front and back of certain trigger points. I wish the AccuMassager came with an instruction booklet and maybe a trigger point wall chart as health care instructional aides. I also discovered that if you want to use the device as a massager, it doesn't work too well over heavy clothing, so stick to a light t-shirt. Overall a good product for trigger point relief and to work on the back of your neck. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
174115,B00EL94X72,Not so good,"Everything was good about this except the actual screen protector.  The packaging was nice, and they came with a nice screen cleaning cloth and application card and the cutouts are correct.  The screen protector went on easily and that is where the good stopped.  These screen protectors distort the screen and give a bit of a rainbow hue. They also gather fingerprints and dirt very easily.  I already took mine off and it just felt cheap and flimsy compared to others I have used on past phones.  I will probably try another since everybody else had good things to say but I don't have high hopes."

However we didn't leave it plugged in for long. It went off as advertised...and it startled the squirrels (though they came right back) BUT it also sprayed our neighbor's house. Apparently our yard is just too small for something like this. (We are moving...we hope & will save this for our couple acres if we get them).Also keeping the hose turned on all the time can play havoc with our water pressure. Not the product for us given our circumstances. We are just going to live with the squirrels for now.

The 4"" needle adapter was too long and the tip angle was too wide.Bought Lincoln needle nozzle next and it was perfect for this.  The tip was narrow, sharper angle, and the right length.  It fits on my grease pump without any problems.  I was really happy that I got the ball joint greased up.  I would buy this again."

1464604,B003Q53VZC,"Clunky controls, very very short.","I don't play online so I need games with a good story and decent single player mode.  I was very excited about Homefront because it sounded like a lot of effort had been put into the single player portion of the game.The overall plot is good.  A great and refreshing variation from the standard, 'the US rocks, has the coolest guns, and it is your job to destroy lesser opponents,' or the whole alien thing.  Regarding the actual characters and story line - there is no back story and no real information about your character (beyond learning that you are a pilot 5 minutes in).  The other characters who are with you throughout the whole game don't really get any story time beyond being generic characters (the tough girl with the conscience, the nerd who makes witty one liners, and the gruff yet emotional team leader).The controls are somewhat clunky and most people will want to turn up the sensitivity.  Following people up and down ladders and getting in vehicles (press x to climb, press x to get in HumV, etc) is poorly designed and at certain points glitches to the point where you find yourself moving back and forward to find the 'sweet spot' where the 'press x' note pops up.  This affects game play when things are exploding around you and you are strafing forward and back trying to continue in the game.  I also found myself running into the friendly NPC's, often times causing my death.The weapons, while seemingly varied, range from one or two that are useful to others that jump immediately when you fire or deal no effective amount of damage.  I believe most people will choose one or two guns and run with them for the entire game.  The grenade launcher attachment for guns are plainly planted and I got the feeling that they were contained to certain portion of the levels, much like the rocket launchers.  I enjoy having a wide variety of weapons available at all points of the game.  The old gimmick of having to find a rocket launcher for a tank or helicopter repeats itself throughout the game and becomes tired very quickly (as it does in every game).The game is short and ends in an unfinished odd place.  It felt like the developers ran out of time.  I was fully expecting to move in and liberate San Francisco but instead was met with rolling credits.  I'm not asking that we liberate the entire US in a single game, but at least one city would have been nice.  They obviously ended this game with the clear intent of a sequel.  Unfortunately when you do the math:  $50 a game, 2(?)Homefront sequels per city, and 5 major cities, means that you will end up paying $500 to play the story through and $100 just to play one decent game.The story does set an interesting mood that is different from the first person shooter. Think Medal of Honor meets Fallout 3.Hopefully the multiplayer is much better and people don't feel ripped off."

The sewer connection I used this weekend was actually slightly higher than the outlet of my travel trailer (I have a very low-profile trailer). As a result, the hose stayed full after I emptied my tanks.  The problem was that with the hose constantly full of water the trailer side fittings leaked. It was a fairly steady drip and no matter how tight I tightened the fittings, they still leaked.

This album is EXACTLY the same. I still think he is a good artist but he made an R&B album again. I was riding with Ja on his first two albums, but since he has gone a different direction. He lost his way. I don't mind a few party/mellowed out tracks but its the same old, same old. I heard New York, then I heard ""I Wonder"", and I thought, wow, he is really mixing it up nicely. I thought this would have a nice mix of gangster music, party music, and R&B type tracks. Outside of about 4 tracks, this is ALL R&B. I don't like it. He is trying to sell records as opposed to making music. I wish Ja would listen to Venni, Vetti,Vecci and his best album, Rule 3:36 and return to what made him a great artist. This was an attempt to get airplay and move units. I have bought every one of his albums, I don't think I will be buying anymore after this. The ladies will probably love this album though. However fellas, after New York, Last of the Mohicans, and track 12, there is nothing here for you...."

1436738,B002EE5RD0,The Picross you love now with extra D's,"Let us just get this out of the way now.... if you bought and played and loved any Picross game you dont need much justification to purchase... This is all the picross you want just with a welcomed twist.For those of you on the fence. I am sure the screen shots are mind boggling and I agree, just looking at this game makes no sense but let me give you the gist.Picross is a logic puzzle game in the flavor of sudoku it looks like math but is far from doing long division. You are given numbers along the width, height and depth of the cube that help you ascertain what is and is not to be kept. Get it wrong and you get a strike get five strikes and you are out (mostly), You are also put up against a time limit so that not only are your logic skills being test but how quickly you can execute on them. The games beginner tutorial sectoin does a good job of laying everything out on the table and explaining what is going on.Much like sudoku or crosswords you will likely find yourself falling into the ""just one more puzzle"" mind set with Picross. The beginning rounds of the game will take you around 5 minutes or so. That short time limit coupled with the satisfaction of seeing the shape color in and animate will have you jumping from puzzle to puzzle and those 5 to 10 minutes start to add up quick.One small knock against Picross 3D is the style of presentation. Picross DS (Created by Q Entertainment) had an austere, pixel art look and feel to it. It was a little sterile but it worked and you never felt like anything got in your way. Picross 3D was created by HAL Laboratory (of Kirby Fame) so the presentation this go around is maybe a bit to pastel and saccharine. Initially Picross 3D comes off looking and feeling like a kids puzzle game but as long as you turn off the droning music (also bad in Picross DS) that charm quickly falls to the background and it is nothing but puzzle time at that point.Along with 350 some odd puzzles that ship with the game there is a puzzle creator for those of you who like to get your feet wet, but more importantly if Nintendo supports Picross 3D the same way they did with Picross DS you will have hundreds of extra puzzles to download and chip away at.Picross DS was a bit of an underdog when it was released... and it looks as if Picross 3D might share a similar fate (limited distribution, little marketing) ... which it a shame because it is a puzzle game that takes an already solid idea and adds a meaningful twist. If you are in to puzzles it is worth your time."
1823978,B0000013GB,"Something different, Something Very Good","OutKast comes out with their debut that is true to their name. This is not the type of album heard from other artists. All traditional rap formulas and songs styles to get on the radio are thrown out the window as Andre and Big Boi bring music that is intended to satisfy fans wanting music from unexplored territories. This makes for a classic and an unbelievably enjoyable album.""Myintrotoletuknow"" is a fast paced hardcore song that proves OutKast is not here to play into the mainstream stereotypes of hip-hop. ""Ain't No Thang"" is one of the funkiest beats ever made and uses a now infamous hook: ""Ain't no thang but a chicken wing..."". ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"" is my favorite OutKast song of all-time as it is a smooth southern beat using a nice mixture of strings and wind intruments in the background. The hook is amazing as this song is literally music to your ears. ""Player's Ball"" shows off the P-Funk influence with a great song conjuring up images of old-school singing and creating music for fun, rather than money. On ""Funky Ride"" is where this album really departs into uncharted waters with a great carefree singing song. ""Git Up, Git Out"" features the Goodie Mob and is one of the better lyrical messages on the album. Cee-Lo, as usual, uses his time well and provides a great verse. ""Hootie Hoo"" is a memorable song as it features a beat that sounds as if it is just ready to explode and will get you saying ""Big Boi's on my left, Andre on my right"". ""D.E.E.P."" is a real nice song as Andre and Big Boi discuss stereotypes.All hip-hop fans should own this one as it is the classic debut from one of hip-hop's greatest groups (my favorite). OutKast brings an album that is original not only in its genre, but moves from song to song well with varying styles."

74327,B006ZRYU9O,Give it direct sunlight,"The Instapark Solar Charger came to me all folded up in a box.  My very first impression is that it looked like a case for a Kindle Fire.  Open it up and it has three panels.  On the back is a pocket which stores two USB ports with enough room to keep a phone or other small device while charging.The first thing I tried to charge was my Kindle 3G . . . inside the car in the front seat on a sunny day.  I know instructions say direct sunlight, but I didn't want something screaming ""electronic device"" staring out the front window of my car.  That didn't work.Next, I tried putting it in the window of my home office.  This is a south facing window which gets very bright, though not direct, sunlight.  On this morning, it happened to be overcast.  I tried charging my children's spy watch.  No go.The sun came out and I decided I needed to go all out and put it in direct sunlight with the spy watch.  Voila!  A very quick charge.  It works!Now, since it was so bright outside, I tried charging both my Kindle 3G and myIncredicharge I-5000 External Battery Packthrough the front office window at the same time.  The Incredicharge charged extremely slowly.  The Kindle 3G still would not charge.Again, I brought the Instapark outside to charge the Incredicharge Battery in direct sunlight.  Whoa!  Another quick charge.One more time.  This time, I attempt to charge my Kindle 3G in direct sunlight.  It was outside all day.  I'd come out to check it every now and then.  Yes, it did charge, a little, very slowly.  After a full day, my Kindle 3G went from critically low battery levels to half charged.So, this Instapark Solar Charger does work very well for some devices.  It really does need direct sunlight.  It doesn't work so well in shaded or cloudy conditions.  I think I need something with a little more oomph to charge my Kindle 3G.  I like the portability, the pocket for storing small devices while charging, the ""green"" aspect, and the aesthetically appealing case.  It's a good idea for camping, but I would recommend trying it out before leaving.This product was provided for review by Instapark."

1367466,B000BKF2I4,Use to be a good game.,"This use to be a very good game full of depth.  They just did a massive change to the game, hoping to get some of the market share from WoW.  They tried to make it feel more ""Star Warsy"".  What they did was tear it apart.  It is no longer an RPG.  It's also not a first person, or third person shooter.  It really is nothing at all now.  For anyone that has ever played a decent shooter, you'd laugh at just how bad this is.  To speed up combat they just sped up the game.  Animations look terrible now. Crafting and entertaining basicly has been taken out.  They went from some 30 professions to 9 (7 if you take crafting and entertaining out).  A major reason this game was so enjoyable was that you could do anything you want.  Now, you're stuck into a profession darn near forever.  You can't mix and match like you use to...ext.This game lost a lot of players after the combat upgrade a few months ago.  And, again they are leaving in droves.  I see this game getting shut down by early next year.  Don't put a lot of time (or any) into this game, it's about to go down the drain."

I went out and bought Sim Golf...  The worst waste of money in my life.  I quickly became bored with the different buildings (there are so few!), and although the course building tool was kind of interesting, it was far from addicting...The actual golfing aspect of the game required no skill, and the houses you build for celebrities are a plain waste of time...It is a plain waste of time, money, and of course, megabytes.

1841821,B000002U8M,Some People Never Know...,"I have read the reviews of this album here and find them nauseating, I mean LITERALLY nauseating - don't read these on a full stomach, to paraphrase one of them. I am convinced that a person who is unable to see the inherent good qualities of these songs is so blinded by the rock press' jaded concepts of ""art"" and ""music"" that they shouldn't have ears. Rather, they should allow the critics to tell them what to think of this music without having to listen to it - it would certainly save their closed minds wear and tear. As for the rest of us, this collection (though unavailable from Amazon.com itself) represents the best of Paul McCartney's 70s career - not a bad thing.Silly Love Songs seems to receive a lot of flack, a lot of totally undeserved flack. It is as though its critics cannot sense the irony of Paul writing an effortlessly melodic, polished, multi-layered song that in essence silences their complaints in spite of their determination. Often persistence is a good thing; but in cases like this it is defiance in the face of overwhelming evidence. The song's message, like the Beatles' best, is not only uplifting but completely true, set to an instantly memorable tune. An example:Love doesn't come in a minuteSometimes it doesn't come at allI only know that when I'm in itIt isn't sillyLove isn't sillyLove isn't silly at all!Quite right, Paul. Only one verse there, along with all the rest expressed in one glorious pop opus. Just listen to the splendid three-part polyphonies, string flourishes, and tremendous bass-line of this great song - mindless indeed. One of McCartney's better goes, I'd say, in the Beatles or out.That sums up Wings work in a nutshell. With pieces like the afore-mentioned Silly Love Songs, Band on the Run, Jet, and others McCartney approaches the grandeur of the Beatles at their very best. Rockers like Hi, Hi, Hi and Junior's Farm demonstrate that he hadn't lost his ability to belt out a pumping rock song now and again, and while My Love, With a Little Luck, and their ilk are admittedly syrupy, there's nothing wrong with a little romantic emotion in music now and again. Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey is a great, tuneful mini-suite of a song, Mull of Kintyre a folksy delight for fans of Celtic music that became one of the biggest singles of all time in the U.K., Another Day a splendid McCartney character-sketch piece ala She's Leaving Home, Live and Let Die a great pop-rocker combined with a quasi-sinister James Bond instrumental. Even Let 'Em In defies in part its criticisms as it builds around a single chord (E major) subtly manipulated throughout as only a master like Paul can.Admittedly, the lyrics were sometimes lightweight, but words are not the only thing that make a song - there exist too the melody (always Macca's strongest point), the arrangement (Paul is a notoriously meticulous songsmith), and the overall mood or ""feel"" which can sometimes exist wholly independently of the lyric or tune. And Paul has, for the most part, always been able to craft a catchy, melodic, polished pop song that all-too-often contains messages and insights that completely escape the mundane minds of critics professional and amateur alike. I don't necessarily recommend this collection - the double-disc set Wingspan is both more comprehensive and affordable - but just to set the record straight, Paul McCartney was and remains an immensely talented musician, for the most part undeserving of the criticisms heaped upon him. In this review I often compare Paul's solo work to his work with the Beatles. Do not get me wrong - I feel that the Beatles were the most brilliant musicians in the history of popular music and that brilliance is not easily replicated by one element of a four-part whole. However, Paul's post-Beatles stuff is still very worthy of recognition and not just mindless pop-fluff. If you disagree, you are entitled to your opinion - your loss!"

Other than these &quot;lead tracks&quot;, there isn't much else.  Say Hello  and Treat Me Well have interesting riffs but are not as complete as the  aforementioned &quot;lead tracks&quot;.

1474829,B004FS8LYK,Doesn't Feel Like A Tomb Raider Game,"As far as a action bloody gory game, sure the game deserves a 5 star. Overall after playing through the game I was not impressed with the game. The game did not feel like a Tomb Raider game. The main story line was survival on the island killing a ton of bad guys. What the crap is the deal with optional cave/tombs to discover, plus they are short. Another optinal thing to do during the game was find artifacts. Overall the best Tomb Raider game was Tomb Raider 1 it actually felt like a good quality Tomb Raider game. Tomb Raider 1 you have different environments throughout the game which is great. There were plenty of puzzles, artifacts, or keys that you had to find in order to open a door in order to progress through the game. This new Tomb Raider game failed at creating that making it not feel like a Tomb Raider game. If this takes place on a Japanese island they could have created a large underground tunnel system that the Japanese developed during World War II to navigate too and from different locations. They could have make a good mixture of different sized caves/tombs to explore that you had to do during the actual game play with better puzzles which would have made the game really cool I think. After playing the game I traded the game back in to get most of my money value back. The game was not worth keeping. The Assassin Creed games are good quality games and are worth keeping bacause you know you are going to get a great story, along with a large amount of game play. Those games are worth keeping."

I threw my tube away the first week I had it and three years later it still performs like a champ.  The chamois will dry out and become hard if left exposed, but once you wet it again, it becomes as absorbent and pliable as new.The other reviews are correct.  This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces.  Once saturated with water, it wrings out very easily and it ready to pick more back up.  After three years mine has held up very well, though it is a bit discolored from the dirt it has picked up from my car over time.This is the only drying chamois most people will ever need."

25016,B00404UR3C,Nice screen protector,"With these Screen Protectors, three issues are a main concern:First is ease of putting them on, and honestly they all are not easy to do, sometimes we get lucky but in reality you really have to concentrate. That being said I got fairly lucky, I followed the directions, and applied the front and back with no major issues, a little lift along the top edge but no dust or bubbles. Using the screen wipe cloth and a credit card, smoothing the bubbles to the edge and waiting 24 hours and you really have to look hard to see that the protectors are on there.The receiver hole along the top was cut, but not removed, during application a piece came loose and lodged under the screen protector, I had to lift up the protector off the glass and use a sharp knife to get it off, this is what caused the lift along the top edge. So remove this little piece (actually three pieces (bottom layer, screen protector layer and top layer). On my protector the hole is not centered, it is open to the left, does not cover the receiver hole, but visually may bother some folks.Second do they protect, so far they are doing well. My only issue is the front one may be causing an issue with touch sensitivity, but since this is a new device and iOS (moved from android to iPhone), we will wait and see if it just an adjustment issueThird is the visual aspect, no rainbow effect, very clear. And actually cuts down a wee bit of the glare/shine versus no screen protector.Since it has done everything it advertises 5 stars."
182416,B00FZ4YZPW,Doubles the battery life on my iPhone 4S,"I love my iPhone 4S and I use it for all kinds of things, from making phone calls to surfing the web, listening to music and taking photos. But doing all of that stuff eats up a lot of battery power. Just when I'm having fun, I get the message that I need to recharge because my battery is down to 20%. And that last 20% seems to go REALLY fast! Enter this Minzos Apple MFI-Certified Battery Charger Case. This slim case has an Apple certified built-in 30-pin connector that I just slipped my iPhone into and then snapped on the clear frame (It comes with a smoke colored one too.) and I was ready to go. The battery can be charged while it's on the phone or taken off and charged separately. When it's on the phone it replaces the proprietary Apple connector with the more common micro USB port. Big plus!The frame has openings for all of my connections like the headphone and volume controls and camera. And it doesn't interfere with the camera like some other cases I'be tried. The best part is that it isn't bulky or heavy. It actually looks like it's part of the phone. It adds a certain amount of protection. It covers the back and sides and adds a slightly raised rim around the face of the phone so it protects it from scratches. There's even a screen protector included in case you need one. It probably won't protect the phone very much if you were to drop it, but not a lot of cases would really protect that well if it's dropped. A small wall charger and USB to Micro cable are included. I often charge mine in the car with a USB charger that I already had.This is a product that I will continue to use because I love the extra battery power and I like the slim look of this case/battery charger. I was provided with a sample from Minzos for review but will probably purchase one for my husband when they are back in stock again to keep him from &#34;borrowing&#34; mine!"

1639287,B004NSKWMQ,Outstanding artisan chocolate,"You can never get enough chocolate and this rich, luscious bar more than satisfies both the chocolate lover and the coffee lover.  It's made in Illinois with quality, all-natural ingredients and has a subtle, sophisticated taste that is both interesting and more importantly, delicious.  The chocolate and the coffee flavors come through vividly but without the cloyingly sweet taste and waxy feel which is so common to commercial candy bars.  The finely ground Sumatran coffee gives the bar a nice, slightly crunchy texture which contributes to its appeal.  This is candy for grown-ups.Scharffen Berger has created a bar which is equal to the finest European chocolates and of which they can rightly be proud."
1866023,B0000TAZS8,2-1/2 stars -- Are crew's albums EVER any good?,"Now, before all you fans start getting upset, let me first say that I like 50 Cent. I also have no problem with, um, the other guys that aren't 50 Cent. ...No, I'm just kidding; I have no problem with Young Buck or Lloyd Banks (or Tony Yayo). But I had a feeling that this album wouldn't be all that because usually when you have an underground crew and one of the members gets picked up by the mainstream and then his solo album blows up, he eventually promotes the crew he's in with the crew's first real album -- and despite its success, the album isn't very impressive. Want some examples? There's St. Lunatics, Disturbing Tha Peace, D12 (admit it), Terror Squad, Flipmode Squad, anything ""squad""...Now here we he have G-Unit's album Beg For Mercy. The album does have its standouts in songs like ""G'd Up"", ""Poppin' Them Thangs"", ""Footprints"", and the title track. And to me, ""Stunt 101"" has become something of a guilty pleasure. Also, ""Lay You Down"" is pretty solid, especially when Young Buck does name-dropping: ""Just `cause I like ice/Don't compare me to Lil' Wayne/I make rap n's disappear like Lil' Zane"".But the main problem with this album isn't really surprising: the other two seem to be in 50's shadow throughout most of the album, and you really only hear 50's voice during all the choruses. Another problem is that although Young Buck does bring the heat at times, he sounds different on most of the songs. And Tony Yayo does show up on two prerecorded songs, ""Groupie Love"" and ""I Smell P"", but I don't think those songs are hot like everyone says they are.And that leads to the bad news. There are a lot of missteps on this album, like ""Betta Ask Somebody""; and the cheesy ""My Buddy"" interpolates the ""theme song"" of the `80s toy of the same name, this time referring to a gun. There are also some songs that are decent until you get to the chorus, like ""G-Unit"" and ""I'm So Hood"".There are worse songs, though. When the guys try to talk about love, things go completely wrong. This is evident on Lloyd Banks' time-to-shine moment ""Smile"". And also, I've noticed that on these love songs, 50 seems to have the worst verse, like on ""Wanna Get To Know You"" and the trite ""Baby U Got"" (on the latter, he starts out with ""(Baby u got) Hips that hypnotize when you walk/I can't help but watch you shake/I love the way you shake"".I didn't really have TREMENDOUS expectations for this album, but it still could have been better. For diehard 50 Cent fans, this album is a winner, but the rest of us will have to wait and see how their next album comes out.Anthony Rupert"

1716314,B00085381U,Goin' Moen!,"This is a beautiful faucet! It is 8.25 inches tall but you can get an extension for a vessel sink.  It is described as ""one hole mount"" which is basically true but it comes with a 6.50 escutcheon which covers any existing holes.Installation on a new sink is straightforward. You will need an adjustable wrench, telfon tape, plumbers putty for the pop-up .  I install the faucet before mounting the sink because you can tilt the sink to work underneath. I don't know if this is the correct method but it works for me.If you are replacing a faucet my advice is buy a ""basin wrench"" about $20 at a big box store. It will save your knuckles and temper. Depending on your set-up you will probably need to remove the ""P"" trap to install the pop-up thingy. Be sure to have a bucket and plenty of towels on hand. (ask me how I know this.)Amazon has the matching "" roman tub"" faucet, model #TS214.I hope this review will help with your decision."
2535658,B00005JPEJ,Nice Production that needed better actors,"The reason why I say this is because at one time Mischa Barton was on the edge of becoming the new Indy darling. As a child actor she gave an amazing performance in a little crime flick called `Pups'. She was also fantastic in the unconventional story of love and obsession `Lost and Delirious'. Now, she is best known for a popular teen night time soap opera called `The O.C.'. She still retains at least a modicum of the talent she has shown in the past although hindered by some of the constraints of the script. Considering the acting abilities of Hayden Christensen is a tricky matter. Some people, especially teen and early twenties girls, just love him. He is a handsome young man, that is true but so far he has been far from impressive as an actor. He is flat in just about every performance I have seen of his to date. He cannot seem to embody his character properly to convince the audience. Part of the problem is the roles he has been getting. In most films, this one included, he appears to be hired for his looks and the female appeal he brings. He needs to take a page from the page book that Brad Pitt used and get a part where he is made ugly. It worked for Pitt; after `Kalifornia' people stopped just looking at him as a pretty face and he got a chance to grow as an actor. Christensen is at that point. He is unable to offer anything to his role as the love struck young man because he is mostly window dressing.The way the overall juxtaposition of the modern with the fourteenth is amusing and makes for an interesting take on a common genre. Director Leland needed more work with this film in regards to its consistency to me. There is a need for a greater focus that is seen here. Now with a romantic comedy you can not fault the writer or director for such overused plot points as the chance meeting or just he right circumstances at the right time. Such overly covenant and implausible things are just part of this type of movie. Even the best of the genre are guilty of these contrivances. Also present are the typical run of devices popular with Elizabethan literature. You always need some sort of misunderstanding and people pretending to be someone else. If it was good enough for the Bard to use in man of his rom-coms it is good enough to be used here. For this period something else is required for the plot line. You have to have some sign of class struggle. The aristocrats of the day were far above the common crowd and this point needed repeated mentions. The addition of the Florentine is also always good for a costume piece like this as it allows the set and costume designers a chance to go all out with lush fabric and well appointed architecture.Much of the movie is paced like an extended music video; with the modern music on cue every time and the staging of the actors just right to show off the best possible camera angles. Leland is a talented director and does manage to keep the movie on track most of the time helping the audience to forget some of the shortcomings of the production. Most of all it is evident that Leland was committed whole heartedly to this film and that goes long way to helping it work out. I hope he does better on his next production."
11557,B002M3TLLC,Not an early adopter here,"I remember reading awhile back about energy usage in the near future--specifically about charging our devices without the need for wires.  Envision being able to install ceiling lights without having to dig out the ceiling.  One of the features mentioned in the article was the ability to charge your ipod, cell phones, gps device, etc. all by leaving them on a single charging pad.  So, I was really excited to see the Duracell mygrid on the Vine program.But my excitement quickly faded when faced with the reality of a technology in its infancy.  The charging pad seemed as unwieldly as a mass of chargers anyways.  At least, if I plug in a power bar to the outlet, I could charge five different devices (yes, with wires everywhere) in a small corner jumbled together.  The myGrid actually demands horizonal space!  I'm sorry, but in my house, flat surfaces are in high demand whether it's in the kitchen, dining room, or office.  I knew that this grid would take up valuable space from other objects or that the grid itself would end up being covered by paper or something or other.  Moreover, despite violating the injunction against taking up flat surface space in my home, it does so only so that it can charge 1 or 2 phones at a time (the grid is small)!  At least when I'm using an adapter, I can unplug it and throw it in a drawer when the phone is not charging, i.e. not taking up ANY space.My other beef was with the need to cover my beautiful phone with this ugly rubber case that has specialized contact points that connect with the grid in order to be charged.  first, the rubber case did not look that sturdy and I didn't want to be rid of my ifrogz case that has withstood the test of a 3 year old throwing it down the stairs.  Moreover, I found it unduly burdensome to have to buy a separate rubber case for every single device that I'd like to charge on the myGrid.  Finally, the case was pretty ugly.I think that this technology is going to rock in a decade or so.  I think that early adopters are probably just shelling out for a nuisance though."

1883338,B0075MFS9Y,What a Breath of Fresh Air,"The music scene needs more artists like this; artists who aren't afraid to do something that's already been done but make it good enough so that it's worth listening.  Actually the Lumineers use such old styles that this kinda thing is basically brand new again.  If I had a Best New Artist award to hand out for 2012, it would go to The Lumineers.  They're more of a folk group, but their Americana style is quite charming and they'd make a perfect opening band for Mumford & Sons.  This self-titled debut album had a pretty big hit with the catchy ""Ho Hey,"" but the rest of the album will have a harder time fitting in on modern radio.  ""Stubborn Love"" and ""Charlie Boy"" are beautiful ballads that will transport you to sometime in the early 1900&#8242;s.  ""Classy Girls"" and ""Submarines"" are a bit more fun, the kind of songs a bunch of friends could sing along with at a pub.  ""Flowers In Your Hair"" has an almost Bob Dylan style to it (I just wish it were longer), and ""Flapper Girl"" is a simply ditty that sounds like it was made for the 1920s.  Again, this album isn't filled with formulas for radio success (like ""Ho Hey""), but fans of folk music, or music in general, will really appreciate this.  This album is short n' sweet, and while some songs are better than others, it shows a lot of promise and I'll be keeping my eyes on this band.  If I had one solid complaint about this album it's that it needs more songs."
1713036,B00063RSJW,Affordable Fein blades (for Fein blades),"This is my most used Fein blade and it is good to know that Amazon is an affordable place to buy them.  The cost of Fein blades is so high that it is often my tool of last resort.  When needed, it is the perfect tool.  Just remember cutting a stainless steel fastener will destroy this blade in one or two uses.  I've found that local lumber yards are simply horrible places to buy any blade, especially Fein blades.  I've seen this blade for over $20.00 each.  I will never buy them locally and will stop using the tool if I cannot source the blades for a reasonable price.  Even with a great price from Amazon, the blades are still expensive to use.  They should only be about $3-$4 each.  Then I'd use the Multimaster all the time, but until then, if there is an alternative, I'll go with the alternative."

2644958,B00009W374,Munch munch munch.,"The Brain Eaters (Bruno VeSota, 1958)Five years ago or so, my wife and I were on our way to dinner. We were thinking about going to the Olive Garden, but decided we wanted to save money, so we went to Friendly's instead. Friendly's is not a restaurant known for expensive food, but after tip, our bill came to just shy of $50. We could have eaten at Olive Garden cheaper. Ever since, Friendly's has been our metric for whether we can afford to eat out. ""Is it cheaper than Friendly's?"". I mention this because I now have a new metric for bad in film. For the last two weeks, I have been asking ""Is it better than The Brain Eaters?"". (According to my spreadsheet, depressingly, I have seen seven movies--yes, seven--about which I can honestly answer that question ""no"".)This ill-conceived mess involves a bunch of technologically-advanced slugs from the center of the earth who want to conquer humanity with a large glowing ball carried under the trenchcoat of one of their human thralls. Arrayed against them are a handful of square-jawed scientists, their cute-in-that-fifties-kinda-way ladyfriends, and some very confused lawmen.While this is an obvious thematic father to such better, more recent films as Night of the Creeps and Slither, and has some archival value for that reason, to call this in any way a good movie would be vastly overstating the case. Everyone is overacting, the special effects are laughably crude, the direction leaves a great deal to be desired, the pacing is remarkably bad for a movie that lasts just an hour. There is nothing to recommend this movie at all. And yet somehow, maybe because of its brevity, or maybe because it is so bad without being as painful to watch as something like an Ulli Lommel or Uwe Boll film, it does have a certain silly charm to it that makes me not hate it completely, in the same way as does Amayo Uzo Phillips' The Python or the immortal (at least, as far as I'm concerned) Night of the Lepus. If you really want to put yourself through this, fortify yourself with alcohol first. I'm sure you'll have a much better time. *"

Simply put, the base of this toy which is made of flimsy ""jelly rubber"" is about an 1/8th of an inch thick and provides no protection whatsoever against it becoming lost inside you. I know this first hand because that's exactly what happened while using it on my girlfriend. Luckily I was still holding it by the black base of the vibrator but was nevertheless freaked out as was she. That design flaw is absolutely unacceptable. Beyond that the vibrator in the plug failed with within a weak. Ultimately, I strongly recommend that you NOT BUY this product."

1862521,B000088E7G,You Got To Be Kiddin' Me!,"First off, I wish I could return this garbage to Best Buys. Freeway is not the worst, but one of the worst MC's I've heard. His flow is stale, and he repeats the same stuff through the whole album. Jay-Z should drop him from Roc-A-Fella. This is disgrace to Hip Hop. I mean the dude can't even hold it on his own. Every track has a famus guest appearance like Nelly, Maria Carey, Faith Evens, and more...&quot;What We Do&quot; which is the album's first single is an attempt to sound all hard. Jigga saved this one. Free's flow is just embaressing. His voice is so annoying. He screams through the whole record, kinda like Ja Rule. Hip Hop does not need another Ja Rule. Ok, the album starts off with a soft, mellow type beat &quot;Free&quot;. Again he just screams blah. blah, blah...boring flow...no skils at all. Don't get me wrong. I am not hating, I bought this CD thinking that Roc-a-fella signed talented artists, but Free is definatly not one of them. Then is &quot;What We Do&quot; feat. Jay-Z. Jigga saved it period. Then is &quot;All My Life&quot; feat. Nate Dogg. This has the typical Roc-a-fella beat with him screaming his whack flow. Another similar track is &quot;Flipside&quot; and this one has a whack beat and Free's whack rhymes. After that, is a duet with pop sensation, Nelly, &quot;On My Own&quot;. This is a pop track with lack of intelegence in the lyrics. &quot;We Get Around&quot; feat Snoop Dogg is a weak attampt for sounding hardcore by screaming and TRYING to drop hot lyrics. This album is very monotone. Same stuff through the whole album. Freeway can't rap. Freeway is not hard. Freeway gots ta go. I recomend Talib Kweli's &quot;Quality&quot; or Nas's &quot;God's Son&quot;. Those cats got REAL talent.Overall: 1.4/5.00 - For at least trying."

1295175,B0002E1O2C,Not up to Par,"I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.  Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string.  Have 2 problems with the strings.  First, the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second, the high D (8th string) seems ""dead""; it does not ""ring"" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good."
3594938,B0002AR18M,Really?,"The reviews made this seem like a magical product, but in my experience, it's barely worked.  I've tried it multiple times on multiple different cats and it really does very little.  It pulls very little hair for the time and effort spent and when the hair does start to come off the cat, it doesn't stick to brush, but rather falls loosely to the ground.  Totally worthless and has been banished to the back of the drawer."
1330358,B00005V9NZ,My kingdom for a trackball!,"... can only say that it's disappointing. It's not that the games aren't true to the original. They are, they're perfect copies. That is unfortunately where this cart goes wrong. The games look great but the gamePLAY suffers. Of the entire collection only Asteroids can be truly called fun to play. The others scream for their original controllers. Missle Command and Centipede (both orignally trackball games) are at best frustrating and difficult to control. After the first couple of levels on either game, it becomes impossible to keep up. Tempest and Super Breakout originally used a knob controller for smooth movement, Tempest succeeds best in this translation while Super Breakout is so difficult to control you cannot clear a single level. Battlezone? Well, to be fair I always hated Battlezone, this version is o.k. but the computer gets some really easy kills on you and it too becomes unplayable. As for the trivia game, no one should know this much about Atari. You'd have to be Rain Man to know the minutiae involved in this quiz. I really wanted to like this cart..."
1654193,B005V9YXTO,Disappointed,I really wanted to like these chips but they were not up to what I expected for veggie chips.  They were too greasy and left a thin film of grease in the roof of my mouth which I personally find disgusting.  My kids liked them but only with the aid of some sour cream or yogurt.  The calories are high for one ounce (130 calories and 7 grams of fat). Reduced fat potato chips are about the same with less ingredients.  I won't be buying these chips.  Check the ingredients list in the description of this product before purchasing.
3583983,B000062WUT,Lambchop is a great girlfriend ~,"Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight, all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose, nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And, uh, this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share, but I think it's time to call the vet."
3692973,B003SOVCPW,Excellent configurable gate,"I am so impressed with this gate for a difficult space where I need it for my Pomeranian puppy- once I figured out the workable configuration and used the end caps to make it rigid, it is perfect, easy to use, and looks great. There are instructions on the Richell website for how to adjust the gate latch to make it close securely and easily.My initial reaction was that it is too high, and I just found out that it comes in two versions- low (20.1 inches) and high (35.8 inches). But I am happy with the high version- I don't have to bend over to open the gate, and I won't risk my neck stepping over it. The wire slats are a bit further apart on the high one, but my 2 pound puppy certainly can't get through them.One caveat- I wouldn't use this for a large dog- it wouldn't withstand the pressure of jumping on it. But small and medium dogs are fine."
118888,B0097PFU1I,BUYER BEWARE,"This case is VERY well crafted and arrived in good condition. However, this extended case will only work with a SEIDIO extended battery housing cover. It will not work with Hyperion (etc.) extended battery solutions. When I called SEIDIO (yeah I was mad) to order their version of the extended back housing for my GS3 it was RIDICULOUSLY expensive at like 30.00usd ... just be warned if you don't already have a Seidio brand extended battery STAY AWAY from this case."
3633862,B000KV61FC,not good,my dog wouldn't even touch it.  However from what I've heard other people use it. It seems way too heavy and bulky for a dog to play with and I can see if causing a lot of damage to your furniture if your dog was to swing this around.  Especially if you have a small child that could get whipped in the head with it.
1781712,B003L0XB8Y,Great tool,"This is a great tool I wish I had years ago. This drill stop is perfect for drilling into materials that you dont want to leave a mark like the metal ones will. Also with this you dont have to sort between a bunch of rings or use allen wrenches. Also this will not damage your bits like metal ones do. Another plus is you do not have to make sure your not in the grove of your bit like the metal ones in which you do. These make it fast, simple, and accurate."

I just wanted to give a heads up to those who suffer from depression and know it can tip with even the slightest chemical change. Be careful."
1404291,B0012N3ZXS,unforgiving timing,"The new focus attack system is not charming to me at all. Normal attack combos require you mastering exact timing like a robot(such as couch M punch to standing H punch).I've done hundreds of online battles by now, and rarely did I see players pull that focus attack off during intense battles(true that noobs use focus attacks more often than experienced fighters, but if you do lots of ranked matchs, you will see tough fighters are more onto trying reading each other's moves ahead, reversals, and short/safe combos than, say, figure out how to do focus attack combos) in addition, I feel some of the normal attack combos requires much more precise timing than other SF titles. I could manage beating the challenge mode. but honestly, it was such a painful experience. If I keep tapping the required buttons 20 to 100 times, I may succeed once. After all, my eyes are not laser precise, and I can't read the frame rate down to 1/10 second. I'm a human player not a programed CPU.But don't get me wrong, it is a very good fighting game, expect the timing thing is a bit too unforgiving."
1800905,B00635VIY8,changed my review,"I originally posted a review of this oil last year, but have changed my mind on the positive review.  I had 3 bottles of this oil and a couple of LUCAS GUN OIL in my garage.  I am totally devoted to the LGO and so I have neglected this slip 2000 oil.  Well, I was shocked when I tried using the oil and nothing came out of the cap.  I know it was opened, but double checked it.  To my surprise the &#34;oil&#34; was caked up and dried around the tip of the cap.  That wasn't the worst part though.  After clearing out the tip I decided to just pour out a little oil straight from the open bottle.  WTF, is all I could think of when a mix of sludge/water/oil came out of the  bottle.  Now, I did use this exact same bottle last year and I know that at that time it was in fact &#34;oil&#34;... It also smelled pretty nasty as well.  Ok, so opened up the other 2 bottles of the same exact oil slip 2000 and looked inside the bottles.  They all looked the same, like crap.  It reminded me of semi-gloss paint that sits for a long time and the oil starts separating from the paint.  With &#34;paint&#34; I can totally understand, but &#34;oil&#34; o.m.g. that's total b.s. and that tell's me this &#34;oil&#34; is NOT safe for long term storage.  You have been warned....."
1835635,B000002IXU,You Bet Your Life It Is.......GOOD!!!!!,"Okay, I was introduced to the music of Tori Amos by my wife, who's a big fan of hers, and has seen her in concert several times. She plays Tori Amos in the car, while cooking, cleaning the house, etc. This has been going on for 2 and a half years now, and I must say that I've been annoyed more than I've been entertained. However, like certain records out there, this one had to grow on me. It's like drinking beer for the first time; it's an acquired taste. Yes, Tori is outspoken, and the music is so alternative in nature. But what I've realized through a few intent listenings is how much thought she puts into her lyrics as well as the music itself. She is a very liberal-minded individual, and this I can relate to, and for that, I appreciate her passionate and philosophical messages through her music. Yes, the music and lyrics are hard to get used to, but in order for it to resonate the right way, I started my listening with one of her most famous songs, CORNFLAKE GIRL, and went from there. As I listened to the catchy chorus, ""you bet your life it is"", I started to like this stuff slowly but surely. What's more is that I've really come to appreciate her musical talent on the piano and all of the other instruments she plays. I would like to see her in concert the next time she's in town. I've passed on it the past two times, but now my wife is going to have an unexpected guest with her!!! I like artists who are outside the box, and Tori fits this mold perfectly. She is a master of thought-provoking words through music. I will boldly move to another album very soon; perhaps Little Earthquakes is on deck."

3622995,B000CMKHDG,Potentially very DANGEROUS -- please be careful,"Please use extreme caution if you purchase these toys for kittens in particular. My 12 week old kitten started to lose weight and failing to thrive when he was always the largest and strongest of a litter I am fostering. I weigh the kittens continually to track their progress. A barium study revealed 5 broken pieces of these springs in his GI tract which will now have to be removed either endoscopically or by surgery if the pieces migrated to his intestines. This would have killed him and/or caused perforation if not caught in time. Despite careful supervision of the kittens during play with the springs, the one kitten ingested them a few days ago. We supervise very carefully as my spouse, a veterinary internist, has had to remove many unusual items from dogs and cats that one would not expect they would/could swallow over his 20 plus years in practice so this happening was especially distressing.UPDATE:My lucky kitten is now a healthy cat in our multi-cat household. I wanted to clarify that pieces removed from my kitten stomach were both the plastic Ethical WIDE Colorful Springs Cat Toy and Ethical THIN Colorful Springs Cat Toys.  The wide ones do not break easily, however, cats can break them and chew the edges making them sharp. People can also break the springs unintentionally. I do not think the vast majority of cats would ingest the pieces, however, I wanted to share my experience so owners are aware that it can happen even if it is a rare occurrence."

I like that they contain whole foods as the source for most of the vitamins.  I wish I didn't have to take THREE tablets, but I  assuming that added space is taken by the green foods that have been  added.Sundown products are the vitamins carried behind the counter at Costco and in many CVs and Walgreens pharmacies.  I have purchased their products in the past and have never had problems.  I wish I knew more about them, but in my limited experience! this seems like a mid-quality brand at a very reasonable price."
2114368,6300248178,Classic!,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, and whenever a new viewing format comes out, this is one of those titles that I will usually upgrade sometime after they put it out on the new format.  I have been watching this movie since I was in high school, and it's absolutely one of my all time favorites. I was actually fairly impressed withPredators ( + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] as well, which I would have to say would be my 2nd favorite Predator movie next to this one.  I wasn't as big a fan ofPredator 2 [Blu-ray] or necessarily the Alien vs Predator movies, but they were decent I suppose.  Anyway, this will always be one of my absolute favorites, along with the likes of such movies asAlien [Blu-ray],Aliens [Blu-ray],Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray], and various others.  This is not any kind of spectacular collectors edition Blu-Ray or anything, but it's still cool."
3408538,B006X040NY,"A New, Tough Bond -- Shaken Not Stirred!","Daniel Craig is a different kind of Bond, and I think he was getting some mixed reviews because viewers were comparing him to other Bonds rather than this film.This film is continuing the origins of Bond, why he thinks the way he does - he's a tougher, more somber Bond who at the beginning of the film with an exciting chase scene through Istanbul, gets shot off a train - and survives!  (Hey, it's Hollywood, that's fine.)I liked this film.  The action was fun but not over the top.  The scenery was very nice - the Shanghai boat scene was lavish. The moody shadow & light show as an assassin gets his rifle loaded up and takes aim.  (But why did Bond let the guy take a shot and kill his target?  That's never explained).The Bond girls were tragic, intensely interesting and Bond's empathy for them was palpable.Enjoyed the back & forth with Moneypenny, as she shaves him closely.  Later they discuss how it's easier to get dressed with an ""extra pair of hands.""  Cute.Yay, we get a ""shaken not stirred"" scene at a Shanghai bar, as Bond is watched closely by a gang of toughs about to kill him.  We get a view of the Connery sports car, the Ashton Martin.Bottom Line:The film made fun of itself at several points, but true Bond fans would get the Easter eggs, and new viewers would be fascinated with the ""origin story"" of our favorite MI6 spy, out in the Scottish Highlands (""Skyfall"").  ""M"" is basically our co-star.  Bond is serious, has a lot of depth, and Daniel Craig plays him well.  Good film.Cast:Daniel Craig - James BondJudi Dench - MJavier Bardem - SilvaRalph Fiennes - Gareth MalloryNaomie Harris - EveB&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe - SeverineAlbert Finney - Kincade"

1818382,B00EPEISF6,Just a tinge of doubt,"About quite a few things:- The manufacturer. Although it has apparently developed a degree of visibility on this site, the products do not appear readily available in the usual suspect brick and mortar national Home Improvement stores.- The price. Measured against comparable models from manufacturers I am familiar with this drill seems reasonably priced with consideration to features and promoted capabilities but I still wonder if it is really a lesser quality product with an inflated price depending on buyer subliminal acquiescence to environmental consciousness.-The lithium ion batteries. This is my first power tool with something other than NiCad (or a cord), and the thought the package includes two 24V 2.0 Ah batteries at the current price point because you are going to need them to do anything substantive.- Long term durability of the tool. It feels lightweight and thus far comfortable to use but I haven't dropped it on the driveway yet so we'll see.I haven't placed any significant demands on it yet, only using it to drill a couple of holes in some drywall and attaching a sanding wheel to it to brighten up some plastic headlight covers and really I could have accomplished either of those tasks with a screwdriver, hammer and a sanding block, hopefully not getting the order reversed. Maybe I'll loan it to an acquaintance roofer who does real work but he might get the snazzy green body dirty.Like most drills today, this "" keyless chuck compact drill makes changing bits a simple task. It also has a 24 position clutch and is rated to deliver up to 498lbs torque from the higher of  two available speed settings. As noted, thus far I haven't needed to crank up the torque or even ramp up the speed to anything near the published maximum rate of 1700rpm. The built-in base positioned LED light, which is not a  feature with any of my present tools will come in handy in tight locations where manipulating a flashlight or getting sufficient illumination can be frustrating.The batteries, delivered with a partial charge, are easily attachable to the bottom of the drill or the included battery charger, when necessary.  As noted a full charge did take about 45 minutes. It should be noted conventional wisdom indicates lithium ion batteries should not be fully depleted before recharging but recent studies have suggested they may in fact have similar memory tendencies as NiMH and NiCad so I suppose for the time being, the user has to make the call. They should not be stored in locations susceptible to either extremely high heat or cold and can be expected to last for two to three years under moderate use and charge cycles. It is also represented these batteries will not drain significantly if left sitting unused for extended time frames.The Greenworks deal also includes an attachable metal belt clip, a dual head screwdriver bit that can be stored on the body of the drill and  a carrying/storage case that will accommodate the drill, the charger, both batteries and has enough room for me to include medium sized drill bit and screwdriver bit sets.In any event, presently I'm quite pleased with the drill and dependent on the course of future experience, this review will be updated accordingly."

1525002,B00CF7KVMI,Waste of money,The game is just another iteration of the same formula for the last 10 years possibly. I honestly bought it for the DirecTV promotion.

3150282,B002DU39GW,Thrilless,"Positives:(1.) Do not see this movie until you've seen the far superior BBC 2003 miniseries (also on DVD). Many feel, including some staff of this movie, to be one of the best TV thrillers ever produced.(2.) A well conceived Americanized version in which the governments use of private ex-military personnel and lobbyists, ostensibly to promote the American concept of freedom, but more accurately it's an exercise in economics or how to get rich quick.Negatives:(1.) Miscasting both in terms of the skill of the actors to become believable journalists, politicians and other professionals,  and stereocasting as exemplified by an aggressive novice female reporter; an unkempt lead reporter; a couple of blacks playing unfortunately stereotypic roles; an obligatory ex-Bond British female matriarch boss; dumb police; sly politicians.(2.) Stereotypic both for the newspaper and background, e.g. reporter strolls through newsroom with harried staff jumping up for attention; unkempt respected lead reporter with unkempt apartment with unkempt office; scenes with helicopters (served no purpose in the story) underground public garages and hotel rooms - all crutches used too many times in movies of this type.(3.) Poor directing with scene jumping and disjointed transitions that left you feeling deprived of connection with the story and it's people. No flow and too superficial. Notice I didn't say characters because there was plenty of, and all too apparent, artificial characterization.(4.) Poor script writing in this Americanized dumbed down version best illustrated by the fact that they had to over rely on music to create suspense and tension;  as well as trying to be contemporary American chic with iPhones, blogs, Blackwater (XE) and  contemporary TV newscasters. Alas, the movie was made before tweets were hot."

1652517,B005KK56JU,Tastes Great,"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others."

1873329,B000EGEKWE,Hit&Miss,"i'd give this album more of a 2&half. vocally he has never really moved me. always dug his lyrics&His guitar playing. this double set showcases his versatility which he has always had,but he doesn't quite have the voice to pull off the bigger task here at bridging the gap that he is still reaching for. Lenny Kravitz styling& success at being able to do certain things on a more commerical level have for the most part eluded Ben Harper,but I give Harper props for at least thinking outside of the box this time around."
2774832,B0007RO4IA,Cyrano put to musak,"Well no one could accuse Cyrano of being melodic. There are a couple here and there, but nothing you would be able to take home with you. It actually seems that Alfano is doing his best to avoid melody. Lots of lines are chanted on one note. What we have is really an old time Hollywood movie where the music plays an important but subservient role and aids the story. And of  course Cyrano is a good story - I admit I wept at the ending just as I did everytime I saw the film with Ferrer. Alagna is a little young for the part, or maybe Ferrer was too old. But you just can't get over the nose. It's obviously fake and wouldn't be a problem in the audience, but on video it just stands there and draws attention to itself. His singing and acting tho are wonderful as is the rest of the cast.  The production is good - sticks to the original story - no director's tricks. I've often wondered what really happened to Italian opera after Verdi outside Puccini. Cyrano gives us an idea what was going on."

3743340,B0002Z9L8K,Disappointing,"Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well."

3601252,B0002DIS1I,Just big enough for 18 lb. dog,"This carrier is great, but, since it is sized to meet airline regulations, you might be shocked at how small this &#34;Large&#34; is when you open the package. My disproportionately long 18 lb. Chi-Dachshund-Mutt fit in, but pretty obviously touched the sides and the roof. The woman at the check in counter easily could've turned me away--thank the lord she let me board without any problems. This carrier weighs 4 lbs. alone; keep in mind that most airlines have a weight limit of 20 lbs. for the carrier and pet combined.After his sedation meds wore off, my dog managed to chew through the mesh panel, but it certainly took him a while to do so. Overall, I was impressed with how well this thing held up. I don't plan on flying with my dog EVER again, so it's no big that he destroyed the mesh. It was also nice that this carrier is non-descript enough that oftentimes people won't even realize there's an animal inside."

2919298,B000KCHZI8,Even cannibals deserve better respect,"BarricadePerhaps there is a fine line between the zombie movie and the cannibal movie .  Whereas the former usually has some kind of comment to make about society in general, the latter inevitably turns inward and holds a looking glass up to human nature itself when it is reduced to its more primordial level.  No such luck in this this little outing set in the Black Forest of Germany.  If you like over the top gore (which I do), then you will love this film.  The special effects are eye-popping in some parts--it must be owned there is one awesome scene shot from the point of view of being inside the cadaver and looking up the spine as the body is being pulled apart.  But good gore cannot alone a good horror movie make, and alas, the way the gore is woven into the story . . . .well, it isn`t.  It is like watching a little kid do something gross and then smirk for his attention.  Where as it was once said that the gory special effects were the story in some of Fulci's finer films, it cannot be so in Barricade, because behind Fulci's effects were some half-way competent actors to give substance to the carnage as it unfolded before and around them.  In Barricade, the insubstantial characters do nothing but make one non-sequitor decision after another:  who takes plastic lawn chairs and tables on a camping trip??--and since when is a car battery dead when you can still turn the car over, if not start it---even I know that much about cars!  The violence in Barricade, rather than logically sequencing some act of stupidity on one of the characters' parts, is almost Monty Pythonesque for its extremeness and for coming from nowhere out of the blue.  As for the main leads, if you are going to cast a scream queen such as Raine Brown, and then not have her scream or get undressed, there's not much left she is good for---and don't say acting!  The video game style first person shooter will either appeal to the view or leave them languishing for the good old days of Blair Witch Project movies that still pioneered this approach.  And if extreme close ups of people's faces while they are scared out of their wits or are getting mutilated aren't enough for you, there are always the sporadic and random pig squeals to signal a scene transition."

1299138,B000RN53LQ,Amazingly versatile practice tool,"I wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features.  Though it's not perfect, it's like having a room full of guitar effects and different amps.PROS:  32 amp models, 16 cabinet models, effects + thousands of available presets = TONES GALORE; good software for managing tones and creating new ones; can be used in front of an amp (in case you want to know how a modeled Mesa/Boogie would sound coming out of a real Vox); lots of connectivity; compact enough that I keep the unit, the cable and the power supply in my case; no tech problems at all; built-in noise gate and tuner; easy-to-use tap feature.CONS:  There's a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models; manual is a pdf file; hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit (though you can rename and re-arrange them with the software); presets based on famous songs don't always sound right; minor background hum; uses 4 AAA's in a few hours and the manual says don't use rechargables (though it doesn't say why); for legal reasons, the unit uses generic amp names (check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps they're based on); with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy; doesn't sound as nice as a good pedal and a Marshall half stack (no kidding, right?  And I still don't sound like Alvin Lee).As an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp, this thing is cool.  You won't get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it.  Master some of the amp/cab models and how to tweak them for gain, reverb, delay, etc. before you dive into the presets.  And once you've got the presets you like best, use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easily.The Line 6 Pocket Pod Pack includes a patch cord, power supply, USB cable, CD, cheap ear buds, and MP3 player cable.  The Pack is 150 new, so if you're going to buy the power supply then just get the Pack.  If you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so it's like new again."

Although it has not stood up quite as sturdily as the previous masterpiece AD, I can still rationalize this as their most mature and certainly most diverse work. Few bands could dip into so many genres without loosing credibility, and the way Patton frames his voice differently for each track compliments these refined musicians like no one else in rock music can, as they say. Perhaps this is even the last disc this truly gifted vocalist approached with full on open mindedness before spiraling into anti-earnestness, but you almost can't blame him when loosing a band as gifted as this."
2757111,B0006L0L5W,Unattractive paintings.....long and a bit boring,"Baby Monet begins with a zebra puppet painting two muffins which turn into 2 huts of a Monet painting.  It was kind of a long introduction.  This has mostly live-action of things in nature, not as many toys as most Baby Einstein's videos; which is nice.  So, for spring they show time-lapsed photography of plants and flowers, which was kind of neat.  Honestly, I thought this video was boring.  It was a bit longer then most Baby Einstein's videos.  I don't think there was anything with holidays, which is good for those that don't celebrate the holidays (Baby's First Imprssions Seasons had a lot of that).  Maybe I just can't appreciate certain artists work but I really did not care at all for the Monet paintings in this video.  Frankly I thought they were ugly and it makes me wonder how Monet got so famous."

1832893,B000002G50,Unfortunate,"If you want just one CD that gives you an overview of Joan Baez's career and contains her greatest hits, well...you won't find one.  Her career has been too long and varied for that.  She was at Woodstock and at Live Aid.  She covered traditional English, Spanish and French folk songs, protest and mainstream pop.She currently has 46 albums to her credit, including 15 compilation albums.  Newcomers to her music will assume that an album entitled Greatest Hits, which is her current best seller, is the best place to start.  Unfortunately, it's the worst.The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down was one of her finest songs; I remember the excitement her version generated in the 70s.  This album has a live performance which is a pale imitation of the studio version.  Her voice is tired and slightly off-key, the backing is scrappy, the acoustics are poor and the tempo is a little too fast.  A mess.She does a Dylan impersonation on one verse of his A Simple Twist of Fate.  This might have been amusing at the time, and may still be to those in the know, but to newcomers it will be irritating and confusing.  A mistake.One of her signature tunes is Amazing Grace, which she has performed better than anyone.  At the 1985 Live Aid concert, she made the terrible mistake of saying the words before each verse, to encourage audience participation.  Mercifully, the DVD of the concert cuts this short.  So why, in the name of all that's musical, does this album include a 1976 performance of her doing the same thing?  An embarrassment.All the tracks were recorded in the 70s (1972 - 1976), by no means her 'Greatest' era, nor her most representative.  Simply, they are her years with A&M; Records.  They had the nerve to cobble these tracks together and call it a 'Greatest Hits'.  A smart marketing move but a shameful musical one.To add a positive note, the final track, Less Than the Song, is very fine.  I guess you can't keep a good singer down.Joan's is the finest female voice of the 60s folk revival and protest movement -- pure and melodious and true.  As a child of the 60s, the album of hers that I remember best and which now seems most representative is her eponymous 'Joan Baez'.  If you are new to her music, start either with that album or with The First 10 Years.  Both are great."

2767990,B0007KZQAC,HIGHLY DISAPOINTED EDITION,"The remade English version of Astro boy 2003 has proven itself to be the worst disatrous version of all time.This is my protest against the company that remade Astro boy. Congratulations, you have secussfully turned a piece of juwel into a piece of junk. Whoever incharge for the ""remaking"" 2003 version of astro, evidently has no respect towards Osamu Tezuka.Before getting this edition, I had seen some orginal episodes from this seiers of which were dubbed in Japanese. I was highly impressed for its charming stories and lively charecters. Delightful as I could be when I found out this show will be relesed on Dcemeber in full boxset collective edition, I did not hesitate to pre-order this item. I waited and waited till the disaster began.The theme song was gone, the background melody used to be so touching and heartstrings, changed into something metallic and cold-hearted with no emotion at all. Is this kind of music the American kids enjoy nowdays? What make them think that this kind of music is better than its orginal? The background music of this show used to be the key to bring the audience to follow the thempo of the story, now thanks to the changes, I could hardly moved by the story with this metallic din.The remaking of the dialogues is another reason to fail to bring the audiences along with the stories. What a fantastic job the have done! Not only did they change the dialogues, but somehow they have managed to change the whole stories. What it used to stimulate deep thoughts, now has become totally rubbish and rediculous. The English dubbing has also failed to bring this version into a higher level. In the specail features, this so-called director Michael Hack questioned the Japanese production crew of ""why would make a children's programe look so sad""? Therefore it turns out to be a perfect edition better than its predessor. Thanks to this director, it proves that kids nowday are mindless glasses afterwards.I will not recomend anyone to buy this edition, especially for those who are fans of Astro boy, I strongly suggest you to skip it for the sake of your memory.Due to my experience with this set, I have very little hope and expection for the upcoming relese boxset of astro boy 1980 the Amercian version."

This is a fairly large unit and takes up a large amount of room in a trunk or the back of a station wagon/hatchback.  It charges fast and has plenty of reserve power to start our motor home or inflate large tires. Great carry handle.UPDATE 19 May 2011:  The user manual was missing.  Now I need it to check something.

She took my name, email, telephone, address, etc.  Said she would ""look around"" for one and send it ""somehow"" if she finds one.Apparently, this is a ""marketing arrangement"" where they buy the use of the Energizer name, then import and distribute it.Design pretty good.

1810928,B009GDHYPQ,"'Very, very happy with it, in the end . . . .","We love this thing!  We already had a good quality programmable thermostat but wanted the remote-monitor and adjust feature.  Now, I did have a truly awful time getting it set-up and working.  'Even had to have the manufacturer send a replacement.  You'll think I'm lying if I try to tell you the number of hours I spent on the phone with the Nest techs and also with my WI-fi provider.  I'm an &#34;old guy&#34; (late 60's) and I can be very, very impatient when it comes to electronics and intimate objects &#34;messing with me&#34;.  The Nest techs REALLY, REALLY hung in there and supported me.  In the end, there was nothing at all wrong with either of the thermostats.  The problem was that some brilliant person at frontier ('different story - - I hate frontier) had set my router so that it thought we were located in the central time zone.  I really think with all of the attention I got on this, the problem should have been discovered much sooner so, I expect everyone learned something with this.  The reason I am going through all of this is - - just be aware that the Nest is very, very sensitive to you having the date and time all set exactly right both on the thermostat and on your router.  Once we discovered the problem and corrected everything went smoothly and I'm 1) amazed I was able to persevere and work-through that experience and 2) I love the unit and its capabilities."

1836113,B000002KBA,Does anyone besides me hate this band?,"Okay, I don't think My Chemical Romance could churn out a song as banal or inane as ""Speed King"" if they tried, and that's the second-best song on the album. Anybody else seeing a problem? This erases all the effort by superior acts like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix to establish rock as a legitimate art form. Take ""Bloodsucker"". It's even duller than ""Speed King"", believe it or not. Three of these songs run at epic lengths, including one (""Child in Time"") being stretched longer than ten - ""Child"" has got to be the most painful song Purple ever recorded, a blundered attempt to combine opera (listen to Gillan's shrieking vocal histrionics and Jon Lord's painful haunted-house organ) and hard rock (listen to Blackmore's unspectacular, clumsy, loud pentatonic twiddling). Sounds interesting in theory, but it's a good thing virtually nobody else tried this. I can't call it the worst song on the album because it gave me a good chuckle (which I'm sure wasn't intended), but it sure comes pretty close. The other two (""Flight of the Rat"", ""Hard Lovin' Man"") are basically just your average Deep Purple songs (or, should I say, sub-average Deep Purple songs) dragged out as long as possible. Ouch. ""Into the Fire"" is everything I hate about Deep Purple: soulless and derivative, with Gillan wailing away as usual. I'm sorry, but I don't like his voice. At all. Now I do like ""Livin' Wreck"" - cool riff, interesting drumming - but it's almost ruined by Ian's shrieked backup vocals. This is insipid, soulless, and overrated. So's Deep Purple. Go figure."

It has moveable dividers, collapsible, and is perfect for keeping grocery bags and the like secure in the trunk. But, it's low, so tall things can topple out. I had been using an old plastic bin to carry taller items, and thought the Thule bag would be much better.Well, it looks nice, but in terms of actual use, doesn't offer any more value than my $1.99 plastic bin. The Thule bin has the capability to collapse, but it's somewhat ackward to do - the metal rods are tough to wedge into place. It's a two-handed operation. The Rola design is much better/easier.There's no dividers within the bin, nor are there any pockets on the outside. It's basically a nylon representation of a box, with a zipper on the top and handles on the side. The base is non-skid, but is not all that grippy. Stopping short caused the bin to slide quite a bit.I wish I could be more positive about this since Thule does make some good products. While this is well-built (good zipper, nice stiching, and quality nylon material) it needs to go back to the drawing board -- either add more value to it by adding features such as dividers, pouches, etc. or drop the price by way more than half. As it stands, if you buy this you're paying an awful lot for something that is functionally equivalent to a plain box."

1687365,B0000222Z6,No substitute for the Porter Cable 310 production router,"While this trimmer might be fine for quick roundovers and the like, it lacks the refinement and precision necessary for fine woodworking and production work. Careful observers will notice that the base and motor are not perfectly perpendicular to one another. There is too much slop in the height adjustment mechanism and set knob. Too, the base itself is not perfectly flat (place a sheet of 400 grit sandpaper on a flat table and run the base plate over it a few times. High and low spots will quickly become apparent.) All in all, the 7310 is very underwhelming in its quality and precision. As far as the &quot;Rotozip&quot; style trimmers go, the DeWalt and Bosch models offer better quality and refinement then this PC, though they, too, suffer from some of the same problems.By far the better alternative is the tried-and-true Porter Cable 310 production router. This model has long been a favorite of professional cabinetmakers (the guys in my shop own two or three each), but it is somewhat unknown to the woodworking public at large. It is not made for mass market consumers (Home Depot/Lowes don't carry it), and PC has instead promoted the 7310 trimmer as its mainstay trim router. The 7310 trimmer, however, is but a shadow of the 310. Read some of the reviews on the 310 and you'll see what I mean. The 310 is truly a fine machine. At $100, the 7310 is not a great value. At $159, the 310 is worth every penny. Spend more now and you'll be very satisfied with the knowledge that you own the very best. More importantly, your work will show the wisdom of your choice.Sadly, Porter Cable no longer sells the excellent offset, angle, and other optional bases for the 310. If you need these you can acquire them used or new-old-stock, but they are getting harder to find. The premium prices of these trimmers and optional bases found on Ebay attest to the loyal following the 310 has. These bases are available for the 7310, but you will still have to deal with the inferior design and quality of that trimmer. Again, go with the DeWalt or Bosch if you need a complete trim kit with all the bases. If you don't need them, get the 310 and you'll be set for life. You'll be glad you did."

2141219,6301543408,The Worst of the Bunch!!!,"Star Trek 5- the worst Star Trek film of all- sufferes from a REALLY BAD script and way too much reliance on face gags and stupid jokes. PAINFUL from begining to end. That said the actual story it self isn't that bad  and often reminds me of the hippy episode of the original series. Not a great episode mind you but if they had actually connected those stories and took a serious look at Sybok's quest and explained his relationship to ""God"" and Spock better it would have worked far better. At least there may have been a kind of connection to Spock having a brother (an adopted brother would have worked far better one who became fascinated with a half human Spock- anything would have been better than what we got) which came out of no where. Uhura falling for Scotty comes out of no where too. Since when did she have any interest in him? The embarrassingly stupid scene of Chekov and Sulu lost in the woods off the top should have been on the cutting room floor. The god awful dialogue between Kirk and Spock while he climbs the moutain just about get me kicking the thing across the room. Them singing Row-row-row your boat just about had me toss my drink at the movie screen when I saw it in the theatre (Doctor McCoy suggests Camp town races which again would have been the better one). A marsh melon? Is that a generic name for a marshmellow?? Although the film sucks it does have a few saving graces which are the serious moments with Sybok although few and far between they at least make it watchable. They couldn't get the special effects they wanted so they hired a third rate shop.. although they do pull off a fairly reasonable shuttle craft (which wasn't ready for the opening spot light shot) and although the barrier could have been way better it wasn't completely hopeless. Nice touch was the viewing room where Sybok works on McCoy and Spock the barrier in the window approaching was pretty good however going through it looked like a bunch of clouds. Over all the biggest problem with this film is the script which has so many errors in it that even a rainy day fan could spot half of them. Did they even watch the other films?? Strictly for those wanting the whole collection."

1339081,B00007M5D8,"A strategic, stealh-based Vietnam sniping game that's a real challenge","How many other games out there, especially ones set in Vietnam, are about stealthy sniping of Vietcong?  I can't think of any, and that's what makes this game so awesome.  ""Line Of Sight: Vietnam,"" developed by N-Fusion Interactive and published by Infogrames, puts you in the role of an elite special forces soldier who travels deep into the jungle to assassinate several priority targets.  It's extremely well done, but definitely lacks polish in the technical areas.  Nevertheless, it's still a rare game that prioritizes stealth and strategy over run-n-gun battles.Your best friend is your sniper rifle, as it's the only weapon in the game that actually allows you to zoom in towards an enemy.  All the other weapons just put a crosshair on the screen when you hit the aim button.  The best moments of the game are when you're stealthily creeping through the underbrush, spot an unaware enemy in the distance, then nail them in the head with your sniper rifle.  The extended inventory slots mean that you can carry a wide variety of weapon, both for long range and up-close and personal if you're exposed.  You're able to loot enemy bodies for additional supplies like health packs, extra ammo, and different weapons like pistols, knives, and assault rifles.  Enemies can drain your health very quickly, so you have to immediately deal with them or risk dying.The graphics, powered by N-Fusion's proprietary engine, are of mixed quality.  It establishes some well-realized jungle environments, complete with thick undergrowth and steamy, torrential rain, but has a very laughable draw distance.  Trees and hills magically materialize into view as you get closer, as if someone is drawing them in.  The sound is clear and immersive, however, as rain pours down, subdued jungle music plays, leaves and branches rustle in the wind, and various animal noises surround you.The Vietcong were infamous for their environmental stealth and barbaric, unconventional weaponry.  LOSV does a fantastic job of creating an authentic Vietnam War experience, one that is based on stealth, patience, and precision.  Out of all the Vietnam-inspired games that were released during the ""Vietnam game boom"" of the mid-2000s, this game is probably the most authentic and representative of what really happened out there in the jungle."
3750640,B000W0TM6Q,Nice design - fits my 2012 F150 hitch,"This is a nicer lock than I expected.  I missed this detail when I ordered it... but this lock is different than the other receiver lock I have used.  Most receiver locks (I think) use spring loaded pins to ""lock"".  When you unlock it you pull a sleeve out and then the springs push the pins away and the lock comes off.  This is all fine and good till you get some rust, then the springs can't push the pins out and you end up banging on the lock with a hammer for an hour (trust me, I know from experience)This pin has a T-shaped tip and the lock rotates around it to lock it in place.  This means there are no springs to jam.  The turning of the key directly unlocks the pin.  This seems much more robust to me.Notes on Material* The packaging states that the PIN is Stainless Steel.  It never claims the lock is all stainless.  I'm guessing the inside of the lock has some carbon steel due to strength requirements.* Some people have complained that the inside rusts.  I put a couple sprays of silicone in the lock to help protect from rust.Notes on Fit* This is longer than needed for my truck.  I have a 2012 F150 with the Max Tow package.  This is probably about 3/4"" longer than what I need.  I was worried about it being too short so I ordered this ""extended"" version.  I suppose I should have just gone out and measured the hitch receiver.* Anyway, I am not worried.  I will probably add a couple o-rings (like others have said) to keep it from rattling too bad.Pictures* I took some pictures of the packaging and on my truck.  I thought it would be nice to see the notes on the packaging so thats why I took the pics..."

111524,B008YRIWWE,"Real review, looked for days and decided on this one...","First of all, it's a hard plastic.  No grip to it.  I say this only because that was a huge buying point and for some reason I thought it was rubber or had a texture that gave it grip.  It doesn't.Second of all, when taking photos it causes ghosting in your photos.  I read this about white cases and didn't believe it but it's true.  The hole that exposes the camera and flash is white.  When you take a photo the flash reflects off the white casing and causes ghosting.  I ended up having to take a black sharpie and coloring in the inner ring of the casing which seemed to have fixed the problem.Third of all, it does tend to push up any screen protector you have installed on the glass.  Has a great bumper which allows you to place the phone face down but unfortunately the bumper does tend to push your screen protector up causing bubbling and eventually dust under the bubbling.I would not recommend this case unless these issues don't bother you.  It's not worth the $16.  You can get cheaper cases that work just as well if not better.  I already sharpied my case to fix the issue so not able to return this one.  Oh well."

There were, I think, a couple of ""meat sticks"" of various types. Both were pretty average / adequate. The pretzel chips I didn't much care for, but then I don't much care for pretzels, generally (other than the big fluffy bready kind, as long as they're not overly salted). The cheese straws had a rather odd flavor, thought not bad per se, and seemed very ""fluffy."" Somewhere between a long thin cracker and something jet-puffed like the fluffy Cheetos.What stood out for me, honestly, was the Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch. SO GOOD. Might have to see about picking some of those up on their own, they're that good. They're basically just cashews with exactly enough sugar to make them stick together even when cut into cubes and ever so lightly sweet. But not so much sugar as to leave your fingers or teeth sticky. Not entirely sure how they manage it. Almost wonder if they bake the sugar on. Regardless. Really good! I don't know if it's enough to recommend the entire box just for that.On the whole I found more to like in the package than not to like. As a care package for a starving college student, it might be well received. Though, whether the ""convenience"" merits the price is anyone's guess. One could probably put together one's own ""care package"" (with even healthier options) for a similar cost. But, on the other hand, for a ""no brainer"" snack package on a trip or an airplane flight or whatever, one could certainly pick this up and run with it. Maybe not the healthiest thing ever, but reasonably tasty on the whole and very easy to port around and dig into on a moment's notice.Will leave it up to the consumer whether to go with this or make your own care package. But even if you don't get this, you should try theMrs. May's Cashew Crunch, if you're into slightly sweet nut clusters. So good. In fact, now that I think about it, I almost want to go out and see if some local store has some. :) (Of the Cashew Crunch.)"

1677399,B00BNR7I18,Excellent Product!,"My son LOVES these things!  One box was gone within 48 hours!  He absolutely loved them.  And I love that it's made of fruit, with no added sugar.  I always like to give my kids fresh fruit like apples, bananas, oranges and clementines as often as possible, but sometimes I run out or the last couple pieces go bad before I have time to go to the store, so these are great!  It's definitely not a fruit/vegetable replacement by any means, but it's a great alternative to things like fruit gummies that I don't like to buy for my kiddo.We will definitely buy more of these!"
3745959,B000BN3A4Y,more like a toy,"I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost."
3757038,B003V3RVWI,WORKS GREAT,WOW I sure had my doubts about this stuff beacuse here in Nevada right now it ius very very cold! So I rode my bike the other day in the rain and it was real dirty so I used this spray on was and it worked just fine and did not even hurt the wax job unbelievable I really like this stuff it goes a long way I did just like it says to on bottle and my bike was clean and still looked GREAT!!!
3227294,B003EYVXV4,Great movie from someone who hasn't read the books.,"I really enjoyed this. It took me awhlie to get my wife to get me to watch it, She read the books, but the last time she did this to me, I was stuck complaining through Twilight. But this was a great movie. I really enjoyed it. Very well done, and I actually can't wait for the next one."
3688665,B003E8GWFW,Cute but didnt last,My dog loved this but it did not take her long to rip it to shreds. You have to  watch them while they have it to make sure they don't eat one of the squeakers
1793053,B004X9CMDW,Adequate for most small projects,"This product is exactly what it appears to be - a simple but useful tool for marking a circle pattern on your woodworking project.  It is made of cheap plastic and lightweight aluminum shaft.  I wouldn't think it is too durable for the long run, but it did what I needed it to do.  FYI - there is no measurement guide on the shaft.  That would be a design improvement the manufacturers might consider for next time."
1295414,B0002E2VXS,Classic Picks,"These are a little larger than a traditionally sized, what you normally see used picks.  Thus, just a heads-up.  Having said that, they are top quality and are excellent picks.  I use all types and all brands and Fender's are always predictably great quality."
1925862,0782002064,Colorized Version Is Awesome,How can you go wrong with this movie.Watching it in color makes it even better. A holiday tradition to come in my family.
180336,B00FHL9CME,This is JUNK!,".What is it about Amazon that they can't oversee the claims attached to what they sell at least a LITTLE bit.I have bought SEVERAL cables from Amazon.The ones that really get my ire up all claimed something to the effect that they are Original, OEM, or something like that &#34;Samsung products.&#34; They even show pictures of the product with the Samsung NAME on it, as does THIS one.However, not everything is as it appears. What you usually GET doesn't have ANY name on it, and is made in China by some knock-off company, not in Korea by Samsung.And, having said all that, to the product, itself:NOT A SAMSUNG PRODUCT. NO SAMSUNG NAME OR LOGO ON IT.Don't make data connections, AT ALL.It is UNUSUALLY delicate, it breaks easily. You have to be unreasonably careful not to bend the cable or it will break. That is fatal. Mine broke within a week.I really resent the misrepresentations and shoddy products.."
3322197,B0050QNO5W,What goes where?,"Like others have said, they (the Travel Channel) should have named these volumes instead of seasons.

1835696,B000002J2S,Pleeaaaaaaseeeeee!,"Today there are lot of untalented artist that claim they arereally talented such as Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton and those kind og garbage. The one who started that was Jewel. This girl from Texas or whatever made this album which has probably one of the most non-exicting collection of songs ever put on an album before. Her voice is not very good and when she sings it's like she has a fever or something and has just thrown up. It's that bad. The music isn't very interesting. She is clearly copying Joni Mitchell ( who is another overrated singer, but has created some amazing songs). The lyrics are not good either and knowing that over 11 million people bought this album just shows how the music industry is becoming more like a circus."
180754,B00FK0ECYA,It feels you pretty much have to stand next to the tag to make it work,"This is a thin plastic device that houses two button cell batteries (included in package) and a Bluetooth radio. You download an iPhone or iPad app for free and supposedly you can leave this in a wallet or something else and use the app to locate it. In pratice, I found this impossible to use. First of all, since it uses Bluetooth, its connection range is really short.  I placed it on my dining table and walked to the next room, and it disconnected. No I don't live in a house with steel walls. Worse, even tho during the setup I gave the app the permission to access Bluetooth even when the app is not running, it does not stay connected to the TrackR device when it's not running in the foregraound or when my iPad is sleeping. Also, what good is this when it doesn't really attach to anything? A small lanyard is included but it's not practical or convenient in most cases. It does not have a built in magnet or Velcro to stick to anything. On their website they quote Cnet as saying you can leave this in a wallet. Really??? The BT radio in TrackR won't magnetize my credit cards? And even tho it's thin it's still too thick for a normal wallet. A handbag, maybe, but then the BT range will be even shorter!The battery tray is very poorly made, and unlike what the sheet instructions say, you have to pull it all the way out to fit the two button batteries inside, and then sliding it back can be tricky. The whole thing is just so poorly thought out, plus the app has to stay on the foreground with your iPad or iPhone on full time to allow it to work, and then you have to leave your iPad just a few short feet from the device, because after you walk away and come back later, there's no guarantee that the app will set off the alarm. I've tried it several times.I didn't get a chance to try the Crowd Source Tracking feature, supposedly it lets other registered users discover your lost item with TrackR and the system will send you an e-mail about it.Finally, why did I have to give this company my name and e-mail address just to use this device? You cannot use the free app's features without registering. Sure, people can use fake info and whatnot, but that's just an annoying requirement, especially considering it's designed for short-range communication between this and the iOS gadget YOU own. I can't recommend this product, at least not before they worked out all the real world issues or clearly communicate to users what the limitations are and how to work around them."
3664430,B001LUCG9G,Much better than I thought,"I had been using a different product that included cleaning pads but they were just a bit too perfumy, but got the job done.  I thought I would try these drops and am glad I did.  I placed the bottle in a plastic sandwich bag and then put it in a cup of warm water, to warm the drops to room temp.  Then administered to the dog's ears.  He accepted them and I was able to wipe his ears out without issue.  The smell is a fresh smell.  Not very antiseptic in odor as someone else mentioned in another review.  But favorable and clean smelling.  I'm better able to detect (by smell) if my dog has foul smells in the ear. *Reminder to keep the tip clean*  I highly recommend this product."
69492,B006GZITVA,"Simple, elegant and effective","This is a great case and exactly what I was looking for. I am not a fan of bulky cases, especially with the Galaxy Note 3. I usually got with TPU because I love the feel and it fits snugly without stretching. Nonetheless, this case keeps the phone safe and keep the extra bulk to an absolute minimum. All of the cuts for headphones, charger, etc. are perfectly aligned. The last item I wanted to address was something which was a concern for me prior to ordering this: the &#34;handle-looking&#34; ridges on the back. They look much larger and more raised in the picture, but they are quite small and protrude only 1-2 mm from the rest of the case. It seems to be just a minor aid for grip.Bottom line: Awesome case and definitely a recommended buy!"

411816,B0042RPDYU,This is NOT a non-toxic product,"This is pretty much the same review that I made for the to-go pack of hand wipesBabyGanics Alcohol Free Hand Sanitizer Wipes, On the Go Soft Pack, Light Citrus Scent, 20-count Pouch (Pack of 4). The ingredients that are listed on Babyganics website (and not even listed here on Amazon) are not the same that those actually used (at least for this citrus scent version, that contains fragrance).These wipes get a ""3"" on skin deep database ""build your own report"" (when you enter yourself the list of ingredients), which is a ""moderate health hazard"". There are worst products, but this is also not a non toxic product.At least this one ""only"" contains fragrance as an additional ingredient, compared to the to-go wipes. However fragrance is a major offender. I guess I'm not too objective though, doing this review still upset by the hand wipes (that are rated 4 and contain potassium sorbate, phenoxyethanol and fragrance on top of the ingredients listed).Anyway - I tossed the box as soon as received. I will stick to CleanWell products, that are TRULY non toxic (rated 0 or 1)."
1799546,B005UD5D36,Perfect for rifle crown deburring.,These dermal bits work very good for what they were designed to do.  Keep in mind they are rubber so they are for very very light sanding.  Each bit will work for approximately one application and then it will be trashed.  I used them for deburring a recrowned rifle barrel.
1167731,B00DZJ4O2S,Fabulous!,This game is addictive. play on break at work and can't. wait to play again.  You will love this Game.
64971,B0060BOYSM,Having to buy a replacement,Bought this to use with my Droid X. Specifically to use for drawing with a game... I've only had it about six weeks and just noticed the stylus end is torn. I have no idea how this happened because I am careful with my things. Also the pen end keeps popping off.  Not happy with it at all.
1547231,B000EDK67K,Do not use for cheese making; allergy alert - not pure powder.,"It may be a great buy for people who don't make cheese and have no food allergies.Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. I relied on a positive reveiw, hoping to make cheese with this milk.  It does not act or taste like pure powdered milk should.It does not make a curd at all.Additonally, the powder has some inclusions in it, small purple seeds (grains), when dissolved in water- it becomes soapy, and tastes soapy too.. Probably mixed with one of those ""gums"" or ""beans"" to give a no-fat product a more ""creamy"" (comes out as soapy) flavor.I give it one star, because the producer of this milk does not indicate the full ingredient list of his milk and tricks customers like me into buying it relatively cheaply, but with a no-return ""catch""."
3676255,B002CZNC4C,Can't get past the smell&#8230;,"This stuff smells like my grandmother's house (think baby powder and cheap floral). It isn't horrible, so I didn't feel like sending it back in the middle of a busy time (moving to a new home) because it wasn't that bad&#8230; but I honestly don't think I'll ever use it. There's lots of grew options out there that will make your little pupster smell delicious&#8230; and this isn't one of them."
461999,B006U7BLAK,Naturasil for Skin Tags,This product does not work. I have used it for six months to remove skin tags and not one has fallen off. I don't know why you want to advertise a product that does not work. I finally had to go to my dermatologist to have all my skin tags cut off. Why do you want to offer a product that does not work? I cannot recommend this product to remove skin tags. I should have asked for a refund.
3749558,B000N3W8J0,Good strong product,"Works just as described.  It does well by giving me a surface to loosen the dirt off my car cleaning brush, and it also allows the dirt to filter through and go to the bottom of the bucket.  Very tough also, a few times I have thrown the water out of the bucket after I'm done only to see the guard launched across the driveway - no harm to it, and just rinsed it off for the next use."
424098,B004JF3G08,Not a fan,"I'm a 30 year old male and I tried this on quite a few occasions over the winter in an attempt to alleviate seasonal depression symptoms. I had minimal luck, which was probably more placebo related.  It is really bright and hard to have pointed at you for the suggested times.  Also it has no adjust-ability on where the light is directed, the kick stand is either in or out and it makes it very hard to properly align with your body. It also has no grip on the bottom and slips very easily on most surfaces.  It has fallen maybe times when gently bumping the unit itself or whatever it is stationed on top.  To its credit, it did not break in the many drops, and all of the lights still work.  I wouldn't suggest this product in its current form even if the light itself did alleviate my issues, I believe it is very poorly designed for what it is supposed to do."
1518613,B00AXE639A,Not suitable for kids....,"Hmmm I am very reluctant to buy this for my kids.It is an alright product, of course way overpriced for kids.Biggest problem is, why is the pre-pubescent girl dressed in skin-tight clothes, with her black panties on the outside, highlighting the crotch area?Could have given her a different costume design, I am sure there are more conservative ones they can think of.So.... just 2 stars."
42733,B004WOBMIE,BIG disappointment,"I was excited to get this because of the extra battery.  Which is needed because even with my Wifi and GPS turned off my Droid Charge battery is awful.  It takes two batteries to get through the day.  I tried extended life, but they don't seem to last much longer.  And to make matters worse, now my Desk Cradle stopped charging batteries.  So other than being helpful to turn my phone into an alarm clock, this cradle is not worth it.  I basically regret getting the Droid Charge.  I don't live in a 4G area, but when I turn off the 4G seeking the my 3G stops working.  I only get 3G when the phone is in 4G mode.  Sigh.  And now the desk cradle stopped charging batteries.  I'm trying to stay true to the ANdroid phones because I really loved my Droid 2 and I love having a Google based phone.  If my Droid 2 didn't die, I could have waited for the Bionic or the Razr.  Oh well, just put up with it for 2 years and probably switch to iPhone.  My iPhone pals seem to get a lot more from their batteries than any of the Droids I've had (and I'm no my second Droid Charge thanks to a defect on the first one I bought)."

It turned out he had allergies to grain and dairy and a weakened immune system.  This dog food has helped him become a happy, healthy dog.

I often will give him a taste of our food from the table IF it is included in the ingredients in this food.  I feel good knowing that he is getting the best food available for him."
46863,B0054VNHSW,Excellent Power pack!,"This Anker Slim battery pack is outstanding.  It is as it says, very slim and convenient.  It charges with a Micro USB cable which is included.  Charge time is pretty quick.  It also comes with a built in micro USB cord that will charge something with a micro USB slot, such as an Android Smartphone.  Most of the people buying this will charge their phones or tablets with this device, and it works great in that regard.  I've had many rechargeable battery packs.  The ones from Anker have always been excellent working and a value on top of that.It also includes a built in LED light which is bright enough for fishing around in the dark in your glove box or purse if you're a woman.  Handy. It also has a very simple battery gauge that shows power remaining in the pack in 25% increments.  All in all, this battery pack will serve your needs at a fine price and without bulk.  Perfect for recharging your cell or giving your tablet a bit more juice if you can't get to an outlet."
1300448,B001MMYVZU,Works as advertised,"Nothing special here. If you don't like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap, and you don't want to bore a hole in the heel, then this is a nice compromise. There are slits on both ends of the leather, which means you can reverse the button if you don't want the logo on the front of the guitar neck/headstock. You could even flip it inside-out and have the soft leather side exposed. I subtracted a star because I think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic."
1299555,B000W00X1Y,Very nice for the price,"It sounds good. Not as a professional tube driver, but quite well for the price. Perfect for begginners and intermediate players that can't afford something else that is a little bit more expensive."

1854171,B00004TA8K,Sleeper cd of 2000 brings Dandy's to forefront of rock,"&quot;Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia&quot; is about as perfect of a rock record as you'll find anywhere.  The Dandy Warhols have grown by leaps and bounds since &quot;The Dandy Warhols Come Down&quot;.  The songwriting is, for the most part very original, with the exception of the blatant Stones lift for the beginning of &quot;Bohemian Like You&quot;.  Courtney Taylor-Taylor and the rest of the band weave in and out of styles and sounds effortlessly which results in a very cohesive listen.The cd opens up with &quot;Godless&quot; (which also borrows a little bit, this time from George Harrison) a stunning mid-tempo, acoustic driven piece, laced with trumpet for extra oomph.  It's a wonderful way to start things off.  The Dandy's followup with 2 instrumentals that fit perfectly in the mix and then the back porch twang of &quot;Country Lever&quot;.  Things shift into high gear with a triumvirate of catchy rockers that practically beg you to put on repeat.  The final 5 tunes are a grab bag of styles ranging from cool loungers to mad rockers to gospel-flavored ballads.  These tales tell a story that everyone should hear."

1705418,B0000DCBK0,outstanding in & out of the table,"This is the ""perfect fit"" for router table use. I can't comment on hand-held use because it immediately went into the router table. This machine is smooth cutting, powerful and quiet. The features for the table mount are perfect. PC put a lot of thought into this one! You can adjust the bit height using the 75301 height adjustment knob, lock/unlock the motor from the mount and lock the spindle all from above. The spindle/collet raises enough that you don't have to reach down inside the mount to get to the collet nut. My only gripe was that the height adjustment knob is an accessory costing an extra twenty to thirty bucks depending on where you find it. Amazon doesn't carry it yet but a web search will turn up a bunch of sites that do. I thought I'd save a few bucks and just use a 1/4 drive 3/16"" socket and extension bar but none of the sockets I have found will fit through the hole in the base. The knob from PC has a second, located lower, plastic guide that helps to align the knob shaft with the height adjuster mounted on the base. I guess the best bet is to spend a few more bucks and get the PC version.This unit comes with an interactive cd that is very well done. Even has plans and a short movie from the router workshop on building a table. Very well done I might add.All in all I would give it six stars if I could.This is an up-date to a reveiw I posted in 2003 the same week I got this router. Well the good news is after 3 years of regular use I would still give this router 6 stars if I could. I figure I saved major money over buying a ""router lift"" type of accessorie because this router does all of that and does it well. The not-so-good-news is the router was recalled. I called my service center and drove over to be presented with a brand new router motor. Yes I am well out of warranty but they gave me the brand new motor, no questions asked! I don't think I could ask for more. I have since purchased the vac. handle kit and can rave over the performance of that item too. Once again, six stars if they would let me! I've never had one moment of dissatsifaction. I have had to make a few minor adjustments over the years but performance has never really suffered. Give this one a good look. I know you won't be disappointed. I sure haven't been!"

1297377,B0006NDF8A,It's not what i was expecting.,"The material it's made of is good, and it holds the guitar. The only things i don't like are 2.1)Each of the corners has a cap. The one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2)The part at the bottom that looks like a U (used to hold the guitar) it spins... It means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still, so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.I would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one."
1560389,B000HVX6NK,THIS IS PRETTY GROSS,"Not good at all. I am comparing these to the Trader Joes seaweed snacks. These are texturally similar, TJs are a bit crunchier. The flavor on these is pretty gross though. They do not taste fresh and crisp, they have this weird gross dirty seawater flavor. I would avoid these and try another brand. I wish amazon will allow a return, but it is food so highly unlikely."

1439462,B002I0EH6I,Not my type of game...,"I bought this game because of all the reviews were so high for it. I personally think it's terrible. The graphics look cartooney and there are no real good cinematic scenes. Also there really isn't much of a story to this game except for you are a fallen angel who tries to regain your position as a guardian angel and you don't know why you lost your angel abilities in the first place. Trying to alchemist anything is also pretty lame and the people you have in your party you create yourself, there is no character story line for them and I didn't like that either. If you are a final fantasy 7 fan or a fan of the other later final fantasies I would not recommend buying this game. Gameplay was lame too."
3094124,B001KEHAG2,"The ""must-see"" independent film of 2008. Melissa Leo is a powerhouse!","FROZEN RIVER is not the sort of movie that will ever generate excited enthusiasm or exuberant praise.  It is a movie of quiet power, and a reminder of what acting can really be like.  It won't change lives or stir national debate.  But it can remind us that movies have the power to show us, up close, how others live.Set in upstate New York, right along the border to Canada, we meet Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo), a late 40-something mother of 2 boys, aged 15 & 5.  She's sitting her beat up little car, in front of her seriously run-down tiny mobile home...obviously frozen in shock or anger or sadness over something she's seeing (or not seeing) in her glove box.  Turns out her husband Troy, a problem gambler, has found her hard-earned stash of cash...the cash that was to make the initial payment on a new double-wide mobile home for her family.  We soon learn that Ray Eddy is almost single-minded in her NEED to get this trailer for her family.  For these very poor folks, it is a step into luxury...one that promises a better life for her kids and a Jacuzzi tub for her.Her oldest son is often left to care for the younger kid, and he has a pretty good idea of just how broke his family is.  He even turns to phone credit card scams to earn some extra money.  But he's only 15 after all, and he might think he's pretty hardened, but he's not.  He's also torn between anger at his mother (who he blames for driving his dad away) and anger at his father for gambling their money away and leaving home.While searching for signs of her husband, Ray Eddy meets Lily (Misty Upham) a belligerent, empty-faced Mohawk woman with problems of her own.  She's recently lost her husband to drowning while he was running illegal immigrants across the frozen river that runs through Mohawk land between Canada and the US.  Her mother-in-law has taken her infant son away, and Lily lives in a tiny camper in the woods, trying to scratch out a living, and trying to find a car to use for running illegals.The two women forge a very rough partnership.  Ray Eddy sees a chance to get back the money her husband squandered and Lily sees a chance to make some money to help provide for her child.  To say that these two women are not well-suited to a life of crime is putting it mildly...but this is no caper movie about criminal schemes gone wrong (although some things DO go horrifyingly wrong).  It is an exploration of poverty and a study of these two women and their relationship.What's nice is that the film doesn't depict these two women becoming buddies, or comrades or even laughing together over a beer.  They need each other to get what each of them wants, and they don't really care for each other all that much...or at least, they don't care to understand each other.  Except you can imagine that driving illegal immigrants over a frozen river in freezing conditions, compromising your own values, just to take care of your kids DOES have an effect on Ray Eddy & Lily.Thankfully, the film never preaches either.  It isn't making a political point.  These people are poor, and expect to be all their lives.  No politician or political party is going to change this.  We aren't asked to think, ""ah, if only we could help these poor folks.""  We're asked to understand what people in these circumstances might do for their families.The film manages to build the most incredible tension during its second half. I will NOT tell you the various things that happen.  In a way, they could be deemed as being a bit too ""Hollywood""...but the movie has earned your trust and drawn you in, that you don't see the developments as mere plot twists, but instead as the natural outcome of what these women go through.  For a movie so quiet and unassuming...it sure had me on the edge of seat and filled with dread.  It also has a truly satisfactory ending...something SO few movies can really claim.There are a few problems with the film.  Ray Eddy, despite all her fierceness and protectiveness, is pretty stupid with money.  There are a couple of nagging loose-ends (what happens to the cars?).  There is also a NY state trooper (Michael O'Keefe) who functions almost like a slow-witted Javier...that it to say, he's a convenient device who makes a couple of unlikely appearances.  Also, I couldn't help wondering if Ray Eddy was totally ignoring programs that might have helped her, like food stamps.But for every little nagging moment, there is a wonderful observation.  My favorite example:  Ray Eddy's family nearly misses their next payment on their Rent-to-Own TV.  And despite the squalid conditions they live in, their TV is of the giant, widescreen variety.  Everything else in their house is cheap and/or broken, but hey, this is America and we've got to have our priorities straight!  Sure, they're eating popcorn and tang for breakfast...but at least the cartoons are giant.  The sad thing is...this observation is all too believable.And let me also say that the performances are revelations.  Misty Upham has the calm, stone-faced demeanor we often see in Native American characterizations...but she shows us in only the tiniest ways, what is going on beneath that exterior.  Charlie McDermott plays the oldest son, and he's thoroughly convincing as a smart but nave, angry but lonely 15 year-old.  But best of all is the always remarkable Melissa Leo.  Perhaps the best performer in 21 GRAMS, a movie packed with powerhouse work...Leo never ceases to be anything but down-to-earth and ""un-actorly.""  She is the most unshowy of performers, yet her characters feel lived-in and alive.  Never afraid to look haggard or lost, Leo also never fails to show grit and determination in a way that is believable.  Sadly, in much the way that Molly Shannon was overlooked a couple of years ago for her work in YEAR OF THE DOG, I imagine Leo will be overlooked come this awards season.But I hope you don't overlook FROZEN RIVER.  For a movie with such bleak subject matter...it is surprisingly uplifting and starkly beautiful.  And with little bad language and no sexual material...I'd encourage you to let your kids aged 14 and up take a look and see how a movie NOT playing in the local multiplex can be so satisfying on a completely different level."
1519014,B00B03H6GM,I loved it. The storyline was great,"This is a play and play again game, I loved it. The storyline was great, games terrific, provided hours of enjoyment. The interaction with characters was fantastic, felt I was in the story itself.  I thought the male character could have been a little bit more developed though. Maybe in a sequel, (I hope, I hope) they could write him a bit more masculine."

I have tried the spiral compact fluorescent, but I really don't like how long they take to ""warm up"" and I'm not so sure about the way they are ""recycled"" locally.  So this seems like a better idea, and I'm happy to see how much brighter they are than regular bulbs.  Perfect for the basement."

2444129,B00004Y631,Not really worthwhile on any level,"I rented this film knowing it would have nothing to do with Beowulf, the book. In fact, I rented it expecting very little, except for maybe a couple good action scenes and some Rhona Mitra cheesecake. There's one passable action scene in the first few minutes, and Rhona Mitra is appealing in her low-cut leather bodice, but she doesn't really do anything in the movie, and frankly, neither does anyone else. This movie is ten minutes of excitement jam-packed into two hours. It's not really &quot;funny bad&quot; in a B-movie way, and it's not really interesting on any other level. The biggest laugh you will get out of this flick is the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; rip-off opening credits. If you're looking for a cheesy B-movie to watch, re-rent an old favorite and don't waste your time with this one."
3710808,B0053V7WHA,I dislike this collar,I didnt like how this leash was a very thin fabric cord similar to a coiled ribbon that is tied to the handle.....TIED as in with a knot. It was also uncomfortable to hold. I was very worried that my dog was going to give one good pull and the knot would come loose. My dog is also hyper and she circles. This leash gets tangled easily.  Not the type of dog walk I enjoy. I only used it once and it got thrown in my garage somewhere. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this.

1413503,B001AZFSDS,A good time waster,"I purchased LotR Conquest because I was looking for an xbox 360 equivalent to Starwars Battlefront. While Battlefront is a sensational game, LotR Conquest is not.Let's start with the singleplayer. It's sometimes fun, mostly easy, and sometimes frustrating. I blew through both good and bad singleplayer campaigns with ease. They don't follow the story well. A few parts I literally died 100 times because of a save sequence right before the point that I died. That was frustrating.The multiplayer aspect of the game is not strong at all. There are very few people playing it online. Those playing have been playing for large amounts of time and will therefore crush you unless you spend large amounts of time catching up.The classes in multiplayer do not feel balanced. There is lots of kiting for ranged classes. Once somebody gets a hero character it's GG unless you happen to possess higher skill than them. Unfortunately, they would not have gotten a hero unless they possessed more skill than you.There is also quite a bit of spawn killing.Overall, if you're looking for a cheap game to keep you occupied for a few days, go for it. If not, beware."
1680417,B00DBSFXTQ,A subtle flavor that lets you taste the topping.,"When it comes to food, I'm a purist that enjoys simple foods.A cracker should be crisp and meant to be used to carry some kind of more potent flavored topping.This cracker fills that bill. Other crackers may be too spicy. This one is almost boring -not anywhere near as dull as a soda cracker, but subtle enough that it won't overwhelm whatever your put on top of the cracker.The crackers are spiced a very light sprinkle of sea salt.They remind me of bagel chips, except hey are stout enough to hold up to scooping from some pretty viscous dips.Serve these with your favorite dip and you will not be embarrased."

1294273,B0002CZVXM,Not as good as Schallers!,These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.

1705284,B0000CCXVO,Terrible quality control,"The concept behind these pipe clamps is great, but I had exactly the same problem that Dana Vogel did (we're not related). Specifically, the clutch plates on the fixed side were installed upside down so that the long tabs point down. As a result, the clamp cannot lay flat, which completely defeats the entire purpose of these clamps. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of obvious mistake, and a company with a reputation like Irwin should never, ever have allowed this to happen. The fact that another person here experienced the same problem leads me to believe that Irwin has enormous quality control problems. I will definitely be returning these. I plan to replace them with the similar ones recently released by Rockler even though the Rocker clamps require a threaded pipe."

1635345,B004IN28BY,Can't recommend ..,"I've made two batches of these, using the chocolate chip variation, and can't recommend them.  The first time, I followed the instructions exactly and they came out really thin and hard, spread all over the pan, and had to be thrown away.  The second time I melted the butter instead of just softening (per the instructions) and they were better, but still not great.  I noticed the dough was flavorless, so I tripled the amount of vanilla, which helped, but they were still missing something in the flavor, probably resulting from the blend of flours in the mix.  I'd recommend the Betty Crocker GF Chocolate Chip Cookie mix if you are a novice baker like me."

1649816,B005DVUTIO,I expected much more from this soup; packaging not easy to recycle,"I saw an advertisement for this new line of soups and was really interested.  I often have soup for lunch at work and thought this would be a nice treat from my usual Campbell's Select Harvest or Thick & Chunky soups.  Considering how much more it cost than those soups, I had high expectations.Before I get to the taste, I want to talk about the packaging.  The usual Campbell's soup comes in a metal can that is recyclable in almost every community recycling program I know of.  This soup package will require more effort from me to recycle.  Instead of a can, it is packaged in a #5PP plastic container with an unlabeled plastic lid.  My community recycling does not accept #5PP so I will have to save it in a bag with my yogurt containers until I have enough to bring them to a local grocery store that collects it.  But even that will take work because the interior lid is an aluminum poptop and there is an aluminum lid on the plastic container.  So I will have to find a way to get the aluminum ring off before I can put it in with the plastic.  I wish Campbell's had stayed with the traditional can packaging.The extra work for recycling and the extra cost might be worth it if the soup were really fantastic.  I didn't think it was.On the plus side, the chunks of beef and potatoes are much larger than even in the thick & chunky line.  And it has portobello mushrooms.  But the carrot pieces were small and the ratio of broth/sauce (it's thick like stew sauce) to chunks of meat/vegetables was thinner than I expected for the price.  I also didn't care for the taste of the sauce.  I couldn't identify why I didn't like it but it didn't taste good to me.  This was a lunchtime ""splurge"" that wasn't worth the price.  I'm not sure I'd want it again even if the price were much lower.I won't buy this flavor again and, unless there is a coupon giving significant savings, I don't expect to try any of the other flavors."
1665489,B007ZMP2M2,amazing coffee,Ok this coffee is some of the best I've tasted for the price.  I can't find this quality of coffee at the grocery for this price.  I'll definitely be buying it again.
327585,B001FSA8X0,WARNING Side Effects,"First, Thank you Amazon for letting me return the item and handling it in such kind, helpful, understanding way.Per my doctor, A Osteopathic doctor (J.S) I have been onSP Green food (two/day for 5 days), Antronex (4/day 30 days) Min Tran (3,3,3 for 7 weeks) now.I begin, slowly to have the worst kind of reaction till I almost went to the Emergency room. I thought I was going to die. I also searched intensively to find side effects, reviews but I could not find much if any negative reviews.My reaction includes:Abdominal pain, Delirium, Diarrhea, Metallic taste in mouth and hair growth on leg, irregular period.I have never had such emergency that is near death. I do not know which one caused this but guessed it maybe Min Tran. 1 hour without it Delirium and itching is more intense. I asked the doctor who gave it to me if I became addicted to it. It did not help at all but ordered me to take more. Until I saw a new doctor who asked me to stop all supplements. The second day, I was stable, and felt much better. Slowly, now 10 days later I felt I am 80% myself. I feel I should post this review and let people know what I have been through.I found one person reported side effects on Antronex.I am still going through testing after seeing five different kind of doctors. I can only honestly say thatEveryone, PLEASE, BE CAREFUL with all supplements you are taking, do not think if it is holistic, then it is OK.Even your doctor say its food, don't trust him, trust your own gut feelings and your symptoms. That is the lesson I learned."
1840912,B000002P5W,The middle album of Hendrix's original breathtaking trilogy,"Like all the greats, Jimi Hendrix always continued to improve with each consecutive outing.  Although it is often overshadowed by the Experience&#65533;s hit packed debut CD, Axis: Bold as Love signified a dramatic growth in the band all around that ultimately results in a more concise and mature message.  While still staying within the confines of 60s radio, a total of only three tracks crack the 3 minute barrier, Axis&#65533;s songs are all well within the short, pop spectrum of Are You Experienced but they&#65533;ve expanded exponentially in content as compensation for what they lack in length.  The talents of Hendrix&#65533;s backing band are also noticeably more developed and allow the group to gel and flow so perfectly it sends shivers down one&#65533;s spine.  Mitch Mitchell&#65533;s propulsive, complex rhythms should instantly guarantee him a spot as one of rock&#65533;s greatest drummers and Noel Redding&#65533;s bass runs sound cleaner and more natural than ever.  The member of the Experience who has developed the most though in the brief time between Are You Experienced and Axis is the legendary guitarist himself.  Instead of flaming out with one passion filled album, Hendrix proved to all of his critics that he was so much more than the flashy stomp rocker sometimes illustrated on songs like Foxy Lady.  Not only do his inarguably god-like guitar skills improve by leaps and bounds seemingly every time he plugs into his amp, but Jimi Hendrix&#65533;s talents as a songwriter emerge on Axis as something intensely profound.  Songs like the brilliant anti-corporate &#65533;If 6 was 9&#65533; and the sleek, jazzy &#65533;Up From the Skies&#65533; show that he has come a long way from his days of power chords and playing with his teeth.  Jimi&#65533;s sense of diversity remains intact as well with a song like &#65533;Ain&#65533;t No Telling&#65533; sitting next to &#65533;Little Wing&#65533; fusing together to create an album that is as beautiful and calm as it is flowing with pure adrenaline.  The biggest difference between the wide range of styles encompassed by Are You Experienced and Axis however is that while Experienced simply sounded like a set of wildly different songs, Axis: Bold as Love manages to seamlessly fit together using each unique element to build something much grander than the individual songs themselves.  Even though The Experience&#65533;s work up to this point had been nothing short of awe inspiring, Axis: Bold as Love was that extra step that pushed Jimi Hendrix and his associates from being simply amazing to being legendary.  All three of the original Hendrix studio albums are a must for any sort of comprehensive CD collection and like the rest of Jimi&#65533;s work, Axis pushed the boundaries of music itself to achieve a sound that completely exceeded all prior accomplishments in the world of rock."

1758170,B001EOS36O,Good - but go with the Photon Freedom,"I'm a bit torn on this on. On one hand - it's incredibly neat and it does work well, but it just isn't worth the extra real estate it requires in your pocket.Here's the  issue - the two ""killer"" features of this light are 1.) it's rechargeable 2.) It's extra bright because it has four LED's versus two. Unfortunately, there are issues with both of these ""killer"" features. Firstly, it just isn't that bright. Yes, it's brighter than a Photon II or a Photon Freedom, but it's not 4X brighter as you'd expect with 4X the LED's, in fact it's not 2X brighter. Comparing them both during the day, and in a pitch black room - it's really only 20% or so brighter than the new Photon Freedom or Photon II's in white. Secondly, the battery only lasts about 40-50 minutes or so on full brightness before requiring a recharge. Usually these lights are most handy for emergency situations and 40-50 minutes just doesn't cut it. While it may seem trivial, it isn't as when you do in fact need a recharge, then you better have the little recharger cord and a suitable battery handy and once you have all three of those items in your pocket/bag/etc its value proposition suddenly starts to diminish. The charger cord is cheap and the wires don't stay wound very well, so I don't think it'd last long on your keychain, and it's just easier carrying a slightly larger light that has a longer battery life, versus all three items.Pro's:1.) Charging feature is easy to use and works well.2.) While not as bright as expected, it is bright.3.) Looks neat.Con's:1.) The unit is much larger than the Photon II and Freedom lights - it's nearly the same size as your cars keyless entry remote, taking up substantial real estate in your pocket.2.) The charger isn't the highest quality piece and will unwind and catch on things in your pocket - so it's not really feasible to carry it around in your pocket - only in a bag or purse.3.) The ""glow in the dark"" button only glows when the button has been recently exposed to light - which defeats the purpose of having a glow in the dar button.4.) You can only use batteries that are magnetically charged.5.) Comparatively short battery life (to Photon II & freedom)6.) Not that bright for having 4 LED's.All in all - I prefer the Photon Freedom. It's a lot less expensive, comes with a magnetic stand and clip (to position it on a stationary object to illuminate your work area), has a 12 hour battery life (batteries take less than one minute to change out) and is MUCH smaller/lighter. I'd rather carry an extra set of batteries and have 24hours of full power run time, versus the Rex, it's charger and a fresh AA battery - which would give you only 3-4 hours of use at best."

3749942,B000P23HZS,Works fine as a maintainer if you don't lose power,"Like a few other reviewers, I've had this ""charger"" kill a few batteries.  It seems like if there is a power outage that lasts longer than a few seconds, these guys get confused.  The BatteryMINDer has killed 3 batteries for me like this.  Everything is fine, power goes off for a couple of hours, you don't think about it, and then days/weeks/months later you go back and the thing has a red light on and your battery is at 1-2 volts.  This is a design problem, the charger should not discharge batteries no matter what. It also does not charge weak batteries.I would have thrown mine away but the desulator mode has brought back a few batteries from the dead.In conclusion, good desulfator, poor charger, and unreliable maintainer."

1742501,B000RFX032,Possibly a lemon,"This review is from a FINE woodworking perspective.  These chisels have received fairly consistent good ratings even since their production move to China.  That being said, one of the risks of buying cheap tools is that production quality is rarely consistent.  I have the 1/8"" chisel of this brand and have had better results with it, but you really don't need a chisel that thin to be as sharp.  With this set I may have been unlucky and received a lemon.Cons:* The backs of these chisels not even close to flat, siting down the back it's very easy to see the rainbow shape with the naked eye.  You can only reasonably hope to polish the leading inch or so unless you have an expensive purpose made grinder.* Though these chisels take a very keen edge the steel is extremely brittle (even after grinding back 1/4"" to compensate for possible irregularity at the tip). The edge breaks down when I'm shaving hairs off my arm for testing.  After two blows with a mallet in even the softest species the edge is completely serrated across the entire width.* Quality of this brand seems to vary wildly, it's a gamble unless you're a framer or a general DIY user.Pros:* The handles are very durable and quite comfortable to hold, their shape prevents rolling.* The blades are longer than most chisels, if you get a set with reasonably flat backs they'd be good for paring.* Great for the general user.* Great price, everyone needs some chisels they don't mind beating up."
3760448,B008FYKOX6,Not impressed,"These ACDelco wiper blades ship with multiple adapters so they will fit a variety of vehicles. The installation directions cryptic and virtually useless.  I wish I'd noticed the videos provided on the product page before I did my install.The adapters are bulky in size and are noticeably distracting in your field of vision when you're driving.  Furthermore, both the adapters and the blades are made of plastic similar to what you'd expect from a Chinese made dollar store toy.  The blades feel super flimsy and do not even have the strength to hold the wiper against the curve of the windshield from end to end.  The actual rubber wiper does a decent job, where it touches the glass.These blades come equipped with a wear indicator that is supposed to let you know when it is time to replace the blade.

1082531,B00BQZBK48,Repetitive and Difficult in the Wrong Ways,"As other reviewers commented, the game is just maneuvering a ball through randomly placed holes using your tilt controls. Same range of holes, same textures, forever. There are three kinds of power up objects placed randomly along the sequence, and three progressively more effective balls to earn through game play.The part that annoys me is that there is really no strategy involved. There is no elasticity to the camera at all, so you can't build up any kind of advantage while you are doing well, and if you are pegged at the bottom of the screen, you literally can't see the shelves until you either pass or hit them. No way to plan even a split second ahead. Which means the game basically consists of achievements that are due largely to luck and the need to play catch-up after impacts you had no way to avoid. No thanks. Calibrate it to always give at least a little warning, and it would be better, but then the Achievement issues (the lack thereof) would be an issue.Tried it as FAOTD, glad I didn't buy it. Uninstalling."

1670167,B00934WBRO,Nice healthy snack,"These are little clusters of apple chunks stuck together with apple juice and corn starch. They are in little balls and actually kind of look like little apples. They have a tart apple taste, with a hint of cinnamon. I like the fact that they are organic and do taste like real food. They don't have artificial ingredients or sweeteners. Probably the only draw back is that they are made in Chile, instead of a bit closer to home, but they taste great."

Maybe I received the only clump-inducing batch that they've ever produced.  Either way, I switched to a different brand for now."

467838,B007DKVI4C,Fails to Provide a Close Shave,The Remington F3-3900B Rechargeable Foil with Pivot and Flex Technology is an inexpensive razor that fails to perform. A razor has but one task and this Remington misses the mark.Aspects that I like include:+ Light+ Fits well in your handAspects that I did not like include:- The initial charge takes a very long time (24 hours)- A little loud- Feels cheap and not durable- Does not provide a great shave. At the end of the day this is the biggest factor with this unit.Overall Assessment:The Remington F3-3900B Rechargeable Foil with Pivot and Flex Technology fails to deliver a close shave which really is the only thing it needs to do well. There are just too many other shavers on the market that perform better. I would not recommend this unit.

1764630,B001U3Z448,"2 stars for performance, 1 star for Leviton","Update 1/21/2014This switch stopped working today, so it barely lasted over a year. I expected it to do better. After all, it is just a dimmer.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I purchased this to replace a 3-way switch that, as typical of that type, the bulb would work for a while, then no start being bad for one setting and then another long before the bulb should have gone bad. So the old switch was also by Leviton. I get this new one and it won't fit! They made the connector smaller than the old one. I go to a store and sure enough, all Leviton switches, including their 3-way's, are now smaller. Why? Is there a conspiracy to change sizes every so many years to make us have to buy new lamps? So I found a connector to fit over the lamp's end and the other end accommodate the new switch.Now that my rant is over, the switch itself works perfectly. The knob rotates very smoothly for a nice graduated increase or decrease in brightness. I use a 100 watt bulb and can get brightness as though anything from 15 watt to the full 100 watt.If you are fed up with 3-way switches and bulbs always going bad, buy this!"
1298501,B000H2BC4E,Not enough gain,I bought this to connect a Technics TT with an Audio Technica cartridge to my newer Onkyo receiver with no phono input. The unit did work but I had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. In addition I have an Onkyo M3040 connected to the receiver that I use for as a zone 2 amplifier. With this preamp I am getting some serious spikes into the amp. They are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. I do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.This unit may work perfectly fine with a Behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. I am returning it.
1884694,B00A3AX9VY,For that occasional irreverent moment...,"Noise masking as holiday fare.  There is nothing unique about this AI alum, his voice or (having among my other holiday tunes &#34;grunge/rock&#34; versions) particularly unique/fresh about this interpretation."
1294099,B0002CZUUG,Nice guitar and a great value,"If you are considering this guitar, I have to assume you're shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end, not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom.  It is in the category of beginner/intermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrument.I really couldn't find anything ""wrong""  with it.  Yes, it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls, such as having only two controls for volume and tone, rather than four, which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson.  But you weren't planning to try to fool anyone, were you?  Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique, rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway.The sound is good, and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine.  The pickups are surprisingly good.  The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls.  It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good, although it would sure be nice if they didn't cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality.As for fit and finish, reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both, and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying.  For several reasons, if I had this to do over, I would not buy it online (nor would I buy it from GC).  Better to inspect the actual guitar you'll be buying, and don't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don't like the first one you see.I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price, but they would have included a full professional setup, including string change.  You are likely to find a similar deal where you live, because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GC.As it is, I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup.  It had some intonation problem, the action was too high, and as others have commented, the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately.  I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners, as I'd read a lot of people trashing the tuners.  Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them, he instead assured me that they were fairly decent, and advised against changing them unless a problem develops.Out of the box, I was a little unsure of my purchase.  However, now that it's been fully set up  and new strings installed, I am quite pleased with this guitar.  I don't believe you will find a better guitar, or even close, at this price level.I did a lot of shopping, and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric.  I was tempted to go with something more expensive, on the theory that in a couple years, I'll want to upgrade anyway.  Now I'm glad I chose this one.  For one thing, this is a guitar I'll always enjoy having around.  There is nothing cheap or toy-like about it.  In 2-3 years, my tastes may change.  I may want something completely different down the road, and now I still have that option.  Had I gone with a more expensive model, I'd feel locked in.  No good!BOTTOM LINE:  If you're shopping for a guitar in this price range, I think you'll be pleased with this guitar.  Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you're buying, and negotiate to have a setup included, because it will almost certainly need one.  Have it set up right, install some quality strings, and you'll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II."
1294015,B0002CZSJO,Best capo out there!,"I've played guitar for 5 years. Seen many different capos, but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser.You really can't go wrong with this capo. It is very mobile, easily adjustable, sturdy, and durable.What's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo. The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black, silver, gold, and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home"
1448683,B002MED6H6,"Worst entry in the series so far, buy the old ones!!","If you've never played Scene it on the Xbox before, do yourself a favor and buy the previous edition, Scene it Box Office Smash.  You'll save money and have more fun.  That version was built specifically for the Xbox 360, and had avatar support, online play, and tons of fun modes designed around the Xbox 360 big button controller.  This game was designed with the Wii in mind, so it's unresponsive, ugly, doesn't have much content, and is real dumbed down.  They took out online play and avatar support!!!  If you already own the two previous games, still DON'T buy this game.  You will hate it compared to the others.Hopefully Microsoft will release another DLC pack for either of the old versions so we can continue to play them until next year when maybe a decent edition of this game will return."
1321373,B00005BIGE,I hate this game......,I couldn't even get through the first level. The graphics aren't 3-D but that's okay because the colors are awesome. I don't like the levels and the powers you can get. It seems very boring for me to go around and punch cages and weird...bad guys. The levels are really bad and it's too hard. Not a good GBA game.

374323,B002UXRXE6,Good Batteries Without Paying Box Store Prices,Having small children I go through batteries like crazy. Amazon has a better price then the box stores so getting them through them is a no-brainer. Duracell has always been my choice of batteries since I've never had one blow or leak. These AAA's come in a plastic container but I prefer the cardboard boxes that some of their batteries come in. Better for the landfill and easier to open and close.
1493350,B0053BSMPQ,Meh,"It's okay. Nothing spectacular. The original Metro 2033 is much better.Both games are as linear as can be but in the original the challenging scenarios, story, atmosphere and characters were so amazing and immersive that you didn't really care. Even after finishing it you wanted to play it again just to re-experience those things. At least, I did.Last Light offers almost none of that. To me it comes off as just another dumbed-down, generic rail-shooter capitalizing on the unique appeal of it's predecessor.I don't know... The game IS good, I suppose, maybe better than I imagine but it shares very little of the things that I thought made 2033 such a great game. This may serve to exaggerate my disappointment.If you have never played 2033 I recommend you play Last Light first and 2033 after. Why? Well. first of all Last Light simply does not offer the greatness of the original. It'll be less of a let down if you go ahead and play it first and because Last Light doesn't hinge on 2033 there is no need to play them in order to get a proper &#34;feel&#34; for the second installment.Yes, the beginning of Last Light will give away some of the things that will happen in 2033 but c'mon, we aren't babies. We already know pretty much how all these games play out anyway and by the time you get around to 2033 you'll probably have forgotten most of what they showed you about it.So, why the 4 stars? Because it's Metro, silly!"
1784356,B003VCL4XQ,Good while they last,"These seem like a great bargain initially. They throw a good, intense beam and seem to be built solidly. But then the batteries wore down and got a flashing red light on the switch, which shuts down the light. This is supposed to be a low battery alert, but putting in new batteries (that were tested to be good) didn't change the flashing light. So I have a flashlight that will not turn on because it still thinks the batteries are dead. Too bad, it really seemed like a value."
1297986,B000BBRZ3S,not my best choice,"It is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it."
192690,B00JFGIVVA,Great sound; difficult user interface; uncertain value,"Bottom line: This is an rather unique take on a wireless mini speaker. It offers excellent sound quality and solid build quality. On the flip side, the user interface has a couple of (for me) major downsides. Depending on how you feel about the light display, this can be either be a unique speaker or something that&#8217;s a poor value.Full review: This takes the typical mini bluetooth speaker a step further by building in a light display that can be tied to the music being played.My initial impression was very favorable &#8211; it feels solid and well-built. It&#8217;s all plastic, but the plastic is of good quality. It is also very well packaged, which is a departure from the usual &#8220;just toss it in a box&#8221; approach that&#8217;s typically seen. Unfortunately, the brief user guide that comes with it is very sparse and doesn&#8217;t really go through the product features or explain them very well. A better guild should have been included given the price point. Also included in the box is a cable (more on that later) and AC plug adapter for recharging, and a very nice cloth carry bag.The sound quality is excellent. The upper and mid-ranges are clear; there&#8217;s ample bass that doesn&#8217;t sound muddy or boomy; and unlike other bluetooth speakers the volume range is excellent &#8211; you can really blare this puppy! Zero complaints about the sound quality be it in bluetooth mode or direct wired mode.The built-in battery is 1300mAh which gives it a longer run time than pretty much any other speaker I&#8217;ve used. Excellent!The user interface is tied to the remote. I don&#8217;t like that since I&#8217;m prone to losing remotes. Granted, this has a slot for storing the remote but should you lose it you&#8217;ve also lost pretty much all functionality from the speaker since there are zero controls on the speaker itself. For me, that&#8217;s a major negative.The remote is small and thin, with well-marked buttons that provide a good amount of tactile feedback. No complaints about the remote &#8211; I just find it problematic that it is a mandatory item to use for speaker control.In addition to the remote you can download an app for iOS or Android for control options. I found the app unwieldy to use versus the remote, but it&#8217;s an option, and also serves as a &#8220;backup&#8221; should you lose the remote.As is usually the case with recent bluetooth speakers, zero problems pairing this with a device. The operating range is also very good with zero dropouts at 20+ feet.You can also direct-connect the speaker to a device, but instead of using a standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord, you have to use a cord (which is supplied) that has a 3.5mm plug on one end, and a mini USB plug on the other. That&#8217;s not a problem except for the fact that you have to remember to bring that cable along &#8211; a traditional 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord (of which I have a bunch of) won&#8217;t work.The advantage to the unique cable is that it can also be used as a charging cable (the included cable has 2 ends: one is a standard USB plug; the other is the 3.5mm plug). So, while it is unique, it means you only need to carry one cord to both charge and direct-connect.The light show is what really sets this apart from other speakers. That&#8217;s hard to judge in terms of value. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care much for it. Yes, it was fun for a short time, but I use speakers for the benefit of my ears, not my eyes. After a few minutes of playing with it, I turned it off (in addition to a variety of lighting options, it can also be turned off completely).So, if you find the lights distracting or unwelcome, you can turn them off but you&#8217;re paying a lot more for a speaker than you should &#8211; there are a number of bluetooth speakers that sound as good as this at far lower price points since they don&#8217;t include the light show.My ratings:Build quality = 5Sound quality = 5Instructions = 2User interface = 2Direct connect approach = 3Overall value = 5 (if you&#8217;re into a light show); 2 (if you just like to listen to speakers)Overall rating = 4. It is worth considering, but if you&#8217;re main goals for a speaker are good build quality and good sound, you can accomplish those goals by spending less than what this costs.[Sample provided for review]"
1299316,B000T4PJC6,Tone is subjective,"If you need a tube screamer. You can't go wrong with the TS9. The only reason why you shouldn't get it, is if it isn't the right tone for you. I say this because you can't say anything bad about this pedal. It sounds amazing. It just might not be your sound. I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9. People who say this is better than the TS808 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording. They prefer it. It's not better. Both are great."
3056307,B001B2U1BE,Highly recommended especially for public library DVD collections,"Breaking the Maya Code: The 200-Year Quest to Decipher the Hieroglyphs of the Ancient Maya is a DVD documentary about the scientific and linguistic quest to rediscover the literary heritage of an entire civilization. In the 16th century, Spanish invaders burned Mayan books and remorselessly exterminated their hieroglyphic literacy. For two hundred years, scientists and linguists have worked to relearn the knowledge once lost, and uncover the mysteries and heritage of an ancient civilization. Though scholars from around the world applied their brainpower to the puzzle, the final breakthrough came from an 18-year-old boy who had been immersed in the glyphs since his early childhood. Revealed, the ancient hieroglyphs tell of an astonishing cosmic mythology, held by a people who burned their blood to invoke the Vision Serpent, that interleaves the deeds of mythical heroes with the cycles of planets and stars. Recounting a treasury of cultural heritage not only for history and archaeology, but also for the six million Maya living today, Breaking the Maya Code is highly recommended especially for public library DVD collections."
1484759,B0050SVMCC,Great Game - Full Features in Portable Version,"Bejeweled 3 for the PC is great, and it loses very little in moving to the DS platform. It is a favorite of my daughter's and she is very ZEN about the whole thing. The game has all the modes of the PC version so there is a lot of replay available. Very solid 5 stars for both game and overall price."
1331945,B000065SQJ,Less is not always better...,"Finished the tournament twice, on different settings.Why less?  Because there is less excitement, less fluid gameplay, and less weaponry than in the first installment.  Where sequels usually follow the formula of let's add things, and make money, this game takes away things and may or may not make money.  Two aspects that really lost were the weapons and the level design.  The rocket launcher is now limited, and no longer has grenades, the sniper rifle has been replaced with a weaker weapon, and most importantly, the starting weapon is now an assault rifle that is weaker than the handgun in part one, AND THEY TOOK AWAY TWO-HANDED SHOOTING WITH TWO HANDGUNS!!!  The weapons balance was one of the great aspects of part one. No other game evere matched that balance.  Even the handgun was effective.  With well place headshots you could take out enemies wit better weapons.  Why the designers would ruin the wepaons balance is a mystery.As far as levels and the game go, it seems they were to scared to change anything there, and didn't.  So there is nothing new, but the levels now are less interesting, and not that creative.  The jump-pads are different than the first installment, but not to good.  They did add a TV atmosphere, with an overenthusiaistic announcer, but even that come across as annoying and not serious enough.And What are the ancient egyptians doing in the game???? (New characters in the game).Just like the first time you get the letter in the mail saying You are the winner of the publisher's >>>> Sweepstakes! - The game's graphics amaze you.  Then the game leaves you hanging with it's lack of excitement.  The game does not grab you.On the bright side, the game is graphically and technically superior to anything out there.  The graphics are incredible.  And on Adept and higher setting th game becomes more furious.  However the gap between skilled and adpet is pretty large.Maybe the producer and design team did not try to hard on this one, beacuse they were relying on the laurels of part one.Finally, a personal hurt:  I picked Frostbite for the cool, rugged gladiator look, and then when I took some rounds the character let out a most un-maly ""OWwwWie!"" - What were they thinking and who put that in there?"
3713511,B005BV24GQ,How funny!,"My little corgi thinks this thing is awesome. She spends all her time trying to rip out squeakers, murder toys, and in general make a mess, so I really love that with this toy, she can't do that. It's hilarious watching her try to figure out how to kill the squeaker. It seems like decent enough plastic for a dog her size, I dont think she will destroy it. It also has a fun bounce when thrown."

1372807,B000FQ2DTA,more like FINAL FIGHT FANTASY XIII,"Feels more like an action game than a Final Fantasy role playing game...it's not bad, just seems like something is missing.  I'm up to chapter 9 now...i'm assuming there's gonna be 13.  things have picked up a bit, but the first 7 or 8 chapters felt like a chore...constantly running away and not really feeling part of the story.  All you really do is run, fight battles, run again, cut scene, run, battles, repeat.  To me, 10 is the last great Final Fantasy I've played.  Oh yeah, the music is pretty bland.  I really miss Nobuo Uematsu's music in this series.  You have no real control over your party...everything is automated.  This is even more hand-holding than the battle system in 12.  People were already complaining about how that game felt like auto-pilot the whole way through.  Well, this game makes that system feel like a high level chess match compared to this ""Paradigm"" system.  All you do is hit X and L1...rinse and repeat.  People have been able to beat BOSSES while not even in the room!  I've read the stories online and trust me, it's feasible that they are true.  This is a very disappointing entry in a once great series that has been falling off lately in my opinion.  I'd say try it if you are a long time fan, but anyone else will wonder why this series has so much high regard if this is the first game they try.  GRAPHICS DO NOT SAVE TERRIBLE GAMEPLAY AND DESIGN!**EDIT...I HAVE NOW FINISHED THE GAME AND MUCH OF WHAT I SAID STILL APPLIES.  THE ONLY ""FUN"" I HAD WAS WHEN I GOT TO GRAN PULSE AND THE GAME ""OPENED UP"" AS MANY HAVE SAID.  IF BY OPENING UP YOU MEAN A LARGE PLAIN THAT RESEMBLES THE CALM LANDS FROM FFX.  I HAD MORE INTEREST IN FINISHING THE GAME SO I COULD GRIND CRYSTARIUM POINTS AND MONEY TO FULLY MAXIMIZE THE CHARACTERS THAN ANYTHING ELSE THIS GAME ENTAILED.  THIS IS THE WORST FF GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED, TAKING THE TITLE AWAY FROM FF8.  IN FACT, THIS GAME MAKES ME WANT TO DOWNLOAD FF8 FROM PSN SO I CAN ACTUALLY COMPLETE IT AND REMINISCE ABOUT THE ""GOOD OLE DAYS"".  FF9 AND FF10 ARE STILL MY FAVORITES.Fun-2 stars (is showing 4 for some reason)Overall- 3 stars"

2322923,6304821549,Star studded funny movie...,"I can see this happening, in a weird way. Hollywood, strange and lost celeb, feeling like they need to speak their mind on something they don't need to. But this is a really fun and funny movie with a great cast. Reality comes crashing in a for a teacher who has lived as deep into a closet as possible until he is outed and then the fun begins. Addressed are many stereo types and phobia's followed by acceptance, by himself, his family and then finding the one he has been waiting for but not allowing himself to accept.

1641529,B004TJD72Q,Best green drink on the market no lie!!!but there was a bit of mishap,"This green blend is the best in terms of quality of ingredients and efficacy. It even tastes good, not great but good enough to chug down every morning. Better than the rest i ever tried in the past.Gave me lots of energy and helped me poo more easily. I would have rated this product 5 stars but there was only one problem. This green powder comes in a GLASS bottle/jar. I recieved this jumping for joy only to find it completely shattered in pieces when i opened the box....sucks i know. It's alright, though i ended up getting a refund. Oh well better luck next time. Great product, careless handling. Beware. If you can buy it at a local foods store then buy it there. Support local businesses. Good bye thanks for reading :)"
1697740,B00004XS96,Forget it,"Did not go all the way into the socket, and did not work as advertized.  A call to the MFG resulted in no return calls.  This unit was to replace an older model that plugged into the wall.  I suggest they go back to that model.  We have two of the old style, one of which died, and newer model was supposed to replace it.  If you look at the base, their are two wires that are supposed to make contact, however if you have a paper inside, that will not allow it to work."

2219785,6302783348,The last opus of the Trylogy!,"This is a hard film which plays with your inner feelings without a drop of merciless. Two sisters stop in a hotel and will exchange her different opinions and points of view. One of them is frustrated lesbian without anything to give and furthermore nothing to share. The other one is the free loving mother of a 10 years old child. In this claustrophobic stage and micro cosmos Bergman will interweave a painful and harsh portrait in a hallucinating and valiant drama where the loneliness, the hopeless, the God's silence and the lack of affection will be the main springs of terrible revelations and mutual accusations.A must for Bergman's fans and despite the elapsed time it keeps its semblance and actuality."

So, it will have to be sent back, or thrown away, or whatever. But it is now TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE!!!!! I was so loyal to this brand and this flavor but I cannot drink it anymore. The smell is different, the taste is absolutely awful. I'm going to e-mail the company but in the meantime, if you drink this tea, stop. It has changed and the change IS NOT for the better. BOOO."

I was thrilled because I live in an old apartment and my doorbell doesn't work. So This was a cheep and easy fix. It worked fine for about a 3 months. Then stopped. I changed the batteries and it worked when I tested it. A few days later the post man said the bell wasn't working. I tested it and it didn't work. I changed the batteries again with new ones. All the lights worked, it test fired just fine. the next day my friend came to visit, and said my doorbell wasn't working. Overall I'm disappointed with this product."
2690694,B0001GNJF6,One of the best film noir from 20th Century Fox,"I ended up buying this DVD after checking it out from the library 4 or 5 times. The combination of Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews is irresistable (as they were in Laura). Dana Andrews once again plays a detective whose down on his luck and in trouble for working outside the law - a character he was born to play. Gene Tierney is the femme fatale who can freeze an iceberg with a single glance but melt a heart with a single smile. Another favorite of mine, Craig Stevens, has a small part of the guy who ends up dead due to the Andrews character's conduct. A good addition to any film noir collection."

1413911,B001B5L7GO,Surprisingly Good Product. What's Up w/ AC Adapter?,"I have had this charger for about a month now, and it's been working great.Unlike another review, I don't think the controllers are very difficult to attach. The charger isn't anything fancy: just four mini-USB chargers with shaped plastic spacers to accommodate the width and rough shape of four PS3 controllers. You basically have to align the mini-USB prong with the controller, but it's not terribly more difficult than, say, plugging a USB cable into your computer the right way.The base is lit at all times by a blue LED, and the front has four red/green LED lights to indicate the charging status of the various controllers, which is  kind of cool.The only quirk I could find about the unit is that the AC adapter's cord doesn't fully plug in to the back of the charger, which seems strange. It seems like it's half sticking out, exposed metal and all!For the price, however, this charge station is a very good value."
522495,B00EOXZJFU,laundry scent additive,"DROPPS Scent pacs..these scent pacs are way easier to use than the granular version.  they also don't leave a thick residue like the granular version.

However, you will not get the BIG scent from Dropps laundry Pacs either.If you are looking for something just mild  then this is for you.  You can actually use this on all your clothes not just your workout clothes and towels."
3757410,B00404WDUC,Very poor quality for the price,"Unlike other reviewers I would have to say I have been very disappointed with this product.  I have purchased two of them, and one seemed to be okay.  The second was more than 5-10 psi off accurate measure.  I checked it against the first unit and a completely different manufacturer's measure.  Even the rather crude gauge on my air tank measured more accurately than this gauge.  At this price the gauge should be very accurate and reliable.  Not the case for me."

2553113,B00005N89K,DON'T  MESS  WITH  THE  DUKE  !!,"John Wayne fans won't be disappointed with ""Brannigan"". Wayne plays a Detective named Jim Brannigan who has been sent to London England to retrieve a known fugitive hiding out there. Brannigan the hard nosed Irish-American detective quickly forgets he's not in Chicago and the British authorities have a different way of doing things. Detective Jim Brannigan teams up with a female constable named Jennifer Thatcher played by Judy Geeson and her superior Commander Swann played by Richard Attenborough.This movie is a great way to spend an afternoon in front of the television. The video transfer and digital 2.0 sound is really good. The picture is in widescreen and it's a pretty clean video transfer with some minor blemishes here and there. The sound is also better than I expected. The DVD doesn't have any extras other than the original theatrical trailer, so it's a bare bones release. Brannigan is full of great action and a very affordable release from MGM Studios. Another John Wayne movie called ""McQ"" from 1974 is available on DVD and definitely worth a look. I hope this review was helpful.DVD Features:- Play Movie- Scene Selections- Theatrical Trailer- Languages"
1295466,B0002E2Z8Y,"Simple, Well Built, Works","Simple, compact, well constructed, easy to use, and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo, designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make, each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar, Heritage Cherry Sunburst), aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar, Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge, andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck, it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock. Not a huge deal, but a consideration."

Now that I'm a bit older, I realize how much better Annie's is. And even though it's not incredibly healthy, it's still somewhat healthier than Kraft is (more organic). It is a little more expensive, but is definitely worth the extra money. You can find it on here for cheaper than the grocery stores often, and using prime and the subscribe and save option makes it the best way to buy Annie's."
1734118,B000LDC3R4,Disappointed,"Having used numerous Greenlee tools in the past I decided to order the Flex Splitter when I saw the Seatek Roto-Split wasn't available for immediate shipment. I have had the original Roto-Split for years but lost it to Hurricane Sandy. It is a light weight, easy handling, well made tool. The Greenlee on the other hand looks like it was carved out of a chunk of metal. Its not comfortable in the hand and does not have the finish of the Roto-Split. The blade on the Roto-Split cuts cleaner and easier through the conduit and is smaller and easier to handle. No real comparison between the two. In short I'll be buying a Roto-Split and the Greenlee will go on the junk pile."
2723849,B0002JJBZY,NO TITLE CAN CONVEY MY ANGER,"The only thing they should have done was clean up the artifacts, pull back from the picture a bit to give it a little more scope, and put them in production order, starting with The Cage followed by Where No Man Has Gone Before, and so on. THAT'S ALL THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE! But, NOOOOOOOOOO.... they had to interject their own stupid opinion into the effects shots. I don't need to or want to see some yahoo's crazy interpretation of so called ""impressive"" angles of the Enterprise. I mean really, if they were going to ruin this show with ""Lucasitis"" they should have gone way out, like a knockdown dragout fight between Spock and Kahn in where Spock kicks Kahn's ass in Space Seed. Or have the Tribbles reveal giant fangs when Klingons were nearby.  Making phaser fire look sharper and space explosions look less cartoony, Hey, I most definitely would have been in favor of that. But for them to change just about every effects scene just shows me that these idiots playing on a computer have nothing but contempt for the great classic series. Until someone comes along and does this series the way I said at the beginning of review, I'll just stick to my original dvd releases thank you very much."

50812,B005CTXWMM,Cool!,I think this stylus pack is a very cool deal for folks that have smartphones. Simply plug the plastic top into your 3.5 headset jack until you need it. That makes it easy to keep up with when you're not using it. It's very light and works very well. I'm going to order lots more of these and give them out as stocking suffers for next Christmas. Thanks to the seller and to Amazon for this cool deal!
2746250,B00064LJVE,2 1/2 stars... Major Let Down,"Warning: This review is spoiler-ish...Well, visually this movie is fantastic. It's atmospheric, spooky, vivid and wonderfully shot. The score is also tremendous and deserves to be part of a more fulfilling movie. I liked the characters. I felt moved during the movie. I thought it was interesting. But The Village was a total let down. I still remember how cool, original, mysterious and exciting this movie looked and how I waited for it to come out. Then it comes out, and what's the big deal, the big secret about the village? Nothing. I was ripped off. Even if I'd never seen the marketing, this movie sets itself up as a thriller, and then it deflates itself. It felt like a lame prank being played on the audience, and it leaves me bitter to think about it.The final twist is just weak. Big deal. It's not that unpredictable. And at the end of the movie, what is the point? In the end, it's unsatisfying as a thriller, as a romantic drama, and as a ""twist"" movie. So the whole movie is just supposed to be these political metaphores? That's it? Well, if I'm supposed to look at the village and then turn a critical eye towards my assumed Bush induced paranoias, it didn't even work. Because I liked the village! If anything, this movie actually made me wish I lived in a place like that. I sympathised with Ivy's father. Plus, the political messages are a bit obvious, simple and trite.I am glad to have seen this movie for its good points, but I still feel cheated. Did everything have to be mundane!? Not fun! This is not a good way to progress the story. Was it all just a lame joke on the audience? And the way things ended up with Noah was cruel and unnecessary. Sheesh."
1851084,B00001IVJS,Absolutely Phenomenal!,"This album is incredible...fabulous...phenomenal! Tori Amos really knows how to make superb, alternative music that sinks into your soul and doesn't let go. Her voice is amazing and the way she compiles her songs together is  amazing as well. This album is yet another masterpiece of her's and has an  overall sound and feeling, of each song, of soaring through outer space and  relaxing in the heavens for awhile......before returning back to Earth. I  also love her quirky lyrics...especially, especially in this album. But, as  if one album of Tori's is not enough, my gosh, there's even ANOTHER album  included in the package of live material from her 1998 tour! This double  album, box set... whatever you want to call it, is ABSOLUTELY  PHENOMENAL!  If you're a Tori fan, even at least a little bit, you must  own this double album. If you like her music a little bit, this box set  will make you like her music a lot more. My brother can't stand her music  at all, but for all you Tori fans out there like myself, this is a MUST  HAVE!"

1876255,B000QUCPUC,Still in the Hood?,"50 Cent came to Chicago talking so much trash about Kanye West. When people brag that hard, you start to wonder is their album really that raw. Initially I wasn't sure if I was going to buy it, but this cat is charming in interviews so I pre-ordered his CD along with Kanye's.  The radio interviews he did on WGCI and B-96 were so funny that I took my shoes off and laid up in my car for an hour to listen to the whole thing before I left the parking lot. I didn't want to miss anything he said--the man had grandmothers calling in talking about how much they love him and to drink his water.  However, I found a Website to preview the whole CD, and I'm so disappointed. Basic summary of the album: Load a gun, I'm fly, I have money, and if I call my woman a b**ch, I'll apologize with my fingers crossed.  AND?!  I heard ""I Get Money"" on ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and I loved the routine they did to that show.  I'd already been bumping ""Amusement Park"" for quite some time.  I thought this album was going to be full of cool songs like that, or at least something clever.  The man even had Robin Thicke on here, and I love Thicke, but I was bored to death with that song. ""Straight to the Bank"" irritates me to no end with that one guy who hangs with him all the time laughing in that anal ""Ha ha ha ha ha haaaaaa"" chorus.  Aargh! Of course the song that really blew me was when he said he's not from the hood, he's still in the hood.  The killer part about that was a young lady called in while he was on WGCI and asked him if she could find him in New York, and he said he doesn't hang around like that.  Now how are you going to be still in the hood, but then say you don't hang around like that?  I hope Kanye's album is better. I'm actually quite shocked that Kanye is being so mellow, when he's usually so vain about his work. I guess 50 decided to take his place."
2469049,B00005JA9Z,an exercise in the mediocre,"I was hoping this film would be better, as the novel it is based on creates a story and world you don't want to have end.  The novel has moments of brilliance, and moments when it fails, and I thought someone creating a film would take the opportunity to expand on the brilliance rather than the mediocre.  Unfortunately that is not the case here.  While there are glimmers of potential, most of the compelling elements of the novel either don't work as presented in this movie or are absent.  The character of Mary in the book was endearing, here in the film she is annoying.  Why change Courtney's name to Serena?  And what's up with the UFO?  There's no UFO in the novel, and it falls entirely flat here, especially when it is shown and is so fake looking.  Sometimes the filmmaking seems lazy, as if a scene is just a bare skeleton, not fleshed out.I'm disappointed.  This film could have been so much more."

You will die a million deaths just to get to the main challenge within the level. Just to get to it you will suffer the million deaths. Just to do a simple maneuver you will die. When you finally get to the main challenge you will die many times and then do it all over again at the very beginning and suffer from the preliminary challenges. I just wanted to throw my controller at the screen. If you are buying this for a young child, or even a child, don't. They will not complete this game. This game is only for hard-core gamers. I don't consider myself a hard-core gamer but I have played many games so I know that this is simply ridiculous."
3637144,B000NVC7DO,Perfect! Have had it for 3 winters for outdoors cats.,"This has been by far the best thing I've ever bought for the outdoor strays, and they would agree! I have used it for 3 winters and it is good as new. I leave it plugged in for days on end, and it always works, regardless of weather conditions. This was a perfect size for a single cat, and durable for their claws.How I used it: I have a K&H; Insulated Outdoor cat house that I used for 3 winters - perfect! For extra warmth, I simply added a waterproof cloth covering on the doors of the house. That cat did not leave the house except to eat and potty, loved it. Per the instructions, do not put anything over the mat. I had a small soft towel area beside of it, but nothing on top of it. I kept the house on a table, up off of the ground.This winter, for a different cat, a male cat that likes to pee on everything, I used a cardboard box house that I made. Same concept, just temporary housing that I didn't mind him making a mess out of, He peed on the pad but it still worked, and it did not penetrate it with odor.We even had two ice storms this year and that sucker kept working. It's a gentle warmth. But once they get in an insulated area with it, it will be perfect. They do not mind the hard mat, the want the warmth it gives off. Trust me! I had two houses for them to choose from, they always chose the house with the heated mat in it.This is so wonderful for their joints, and overall their health. So worth the money. Seeing how it helped them made me so happy, I was thrilled with this purchase. I love this thing, the cats love this thing. I hope you buy it!"
3739195,B00H8MDKBE,Great Odor Protection and Effective Clumping,"We just got a cat and whose job is it to clean the litter?  Not the person who wanted the cat, I'll tell you.  However, this particular litter is something that I now buy regularly, as it really does a great job of sealing off any liquid waste, or any solid waste if the cat does her part in burying it, and keeping the house free from cat odor.When scooping out the litter, the clumps stay together rather than falling apart with no spills so far. I'm very pleased and highly recommend it."
3673523,B00292BMMM,"Hardly lasted, less than 10 minutes by 6 month old pup","Treats were inserted into the big blue Everlasting ball, properly. Originally the treat ball came with one treat, so I bought these for refill of ball. I prefer to keep her no grains of any type, but the ball came only with one regular treat preloaded in it. My 6 month old rottie pup had that first treat out of the ball and a major hunk of the ball scooped out and all were entirely consumed in under 10 minutes. So I tried reloading the ball with the replacement treat, she removed and fully consumed the treat even faster. The last try of the refill did take her about 12 minutes as she decided to remove the treat and herself to another room to consume it. Way too costly for the speed of consumption by this girl."

This was a great documentary...funny and strange and so full of life (although maybe not a side of life that everyone would be comfortable with). What a conundrum...to be such a seemingly shy and quiet person doing work that is so confrontational and dark. What a wonderful thing to make a living at something that is an obsession. R. Crumb is a great artist, period...not just a great comic/comix artist. The volume of work and the quality of that work is amazing.  It was nice to get to know him a little through this film."

2293289,6304198841,Matrix Trilogy of Anime,"This is wildly overrated.  Other people have said that the last disc of the series resolved nothing.  This shouldn't have come as much of a surprise to them -- it wasn't until the end of disc 4 that there was actually a tangible plot, and that plot wasn't developed further until disc 7.  By this time, they've changed half of their world-building to fit their evolving philosophical exploration (which never gets beyond the middle-school characters).  And after all of this, they've got several sequences where they leave the viewers staring at the same cel and listening to script plod slowly along.Neon Genesis Evangelion, like the Matrix trilogy, isn't abominable -- but I wouldn't do it again, and can't therefore recommend that other people spend money to watch it for themselves.If you want incomprehensible philosophizing, watch Lain -- it's more interesting.If you want philosophizing dramatic action, watch Trigun -- it's much more powerful.If you want useful existentialism, watch Slayers Next -- it's infinitely more enjoyable."

1538004,B0002PSOJW,"It's Huy Fong, but it feels so right.","Ok, sriracha being delicious isn't exactly a secret anymore.  But if you're here and looking at reviews I'm guessing that you haven't had an opportunity to try it out yet.  Sriracha, also known as ""rooster sauce"" because of the rooster on the green topped bottle, is a delicious hot chili sauce that works in many different ways.  It is excellent for spicing up a dish in the kitchen. I use it in several different recipes to add a nice kick. In fact, my understanding is that Sriracha got its fame as restaurants discovered the product and starting using it in their recipes. It also works great as a condiment, and is slowly showing up on restaurant tables as the years go by.  I've come to the point where I'll even dip my pizza in this stuff, it's that good! It might take you a few tries to learn what the right amount of sauce is for you to get that lip tingling boost to your favorite foods, but find it you will, and you won't regret the purchase. The bottom line is that your kitchen probably shouldn't be considered complete without a bottle of Sriracha present.  It's definitely something you need to try, and I wouldn't be surprised if it rises to the level of ketchup, mustard and mayo as something every American household has in the kitchen a few years down the road."
1679192,B00CP3LPZY,Reeses ROCKS !!!,One of the GREAT things about winter in NYC is that the chocolate candy stays FRESH at the news stands & doesn't melt !!It is one of the BEST candy item out there !! WOO HOO !!  ;D
1271,B0009B0IX4,Perfect fit for intended purpose,"This was my first bluetooth headset and I have used for more than 8 months now. It is perfectly fit for me and I am satisfied with the quality of voice both ways.Pros:1. Very flexible and can fit as u like.2. Can be used on both ears3. Voice activated dialing works, so it is convenient to call someone while driving.4. Battery retains charge for quite long time, depending on your talk time.5. filter for air noise works. I tested it while driving on highway with open window. Caller confirmed very little air noise disturbance and great voice quality.Cons:1. Switch off little inconvenient to use when it is on your ear. But the flip side is that you would like to keep it on, while on your ear. So, not a problem.2. Some reviewers have mentioned, difficulty in positioning on ear due to flexibility. But it is not a big issue, since once positioned, it stays there.**-> The best thing I liked is the Customer Service from Plantronics. My first headset developed some problem with the microphone and people were not able to listen to me. I called Plantronics on a Sunday evening and the rep guided me through the online warranty form, very nicely and I got my replacement part within three days. Perfect..isn't it?"
1869992,B0007NFL18,Gaawbage!!!,"i had the luxury of gettin my hands on this album a couple weeks ago. since then, i have listened to hit about 4 or 5 times. Throughout the entire cd, i only heard one line that i thought was remotely clever. not one Verse, one LINE.""sometimes i sit and look at life from a different angle, dont know if im god's child or satan's angel."" - I'm Supposed to die tonight. That was the only line on the whole album that i thought was hot. Gatmann and Robbin has gotta be the most wack song i've heard in my life. for real.candy shop. that song does what its supposed to do. make puplicity for olivia and promote 50's new album. but thats it. im pretty sure that 50 got his rhymes for this track from his book of cut rhymes. (probably the majic stick page). I cant believe that 50 is using this as single, and then callin' out joe crack. PLEASE. alot of people dont know that this beat was produced by Scott Storch. Scott Storch produced this beat WITH Fat joe. Fat joe said he didnt want it cause it sounded too much like lean back. 50 is biten the hand that feeds him.After all the hype about piggy bank, i dont think 50 could have made a less dissapointing battle track. all he had to say is ""i get paid, you don't"". FOr real, 50 must not understand that there are different types of emcees. Jadakiss, fat joe, and nas are the rappers that dont sell much but are respected in the street. As much as it pains me to say it, 50 is the next ja rule. jUst wait, im tellin u, in the next two years, everyone will hate 50 as much as they hate ja. seriously, hes already gettin shot at outside radio stations. NEw York city hates him, so where can he rep? all 50 is, is a knucklhead who gets the top producers to give him good beats, then he spits generic crap over it so that aftermath can sell units to white kids in the suburbs.I have a feeling that one of the big reasons why 50 and game are gettin into it now is that 50 is mad because games album is better than his.To all the 50 stans: THIS ALBUM IS STRAIGHT GARBAGE!! PLEASE ADMIT IT.Get rich or die tryin = 4 1/2 micsGuess who's back = 4 micsTHe massacre = 2 micsThe massacre high points: in my hood, im supposed to die tonight, ski mask way, i dont need emI can sum up this album like this. Hot production overshadows lazy lyrics from a rapper that used to bring it. But 50 has already fallen off after 1 good studio album and a decent ep.My prediction, this album gets no love from the streets, especially new york, but will still sell 5 million units at the very least because it is so commercial."
375551,B002VWJZHE,Drive medical deluxe gel wheelchair seat cushion,"The cushion is very comfortable, but slick. Our family member actually slid out of his wheelchair once, wearing cotton shorts. We purchased heavy duty Velcro and stuck it to the chair to ensure safety. We also now use a safety belt to help keep him secure in the chair and do have to reposition him frequently, as he slides forward. We have actually considered replacing it with another seat cushion. The manufacturers need to rethink the cover so it's not so slick or provide an additional cover that has some traction to it. If you have the ability to sit upright in a chair and can reposition yourself easily, this would work. However, if you cannot do these things yourself or have any lower extremity paralysis, get a different cushion or make modifications to this one, like the Velcro strips and/or a fabric cover with some traction to it."
3286992,B004EPYZT4,"Terrible, easily worst movie of 2011","I had pretty low expectations going into this.  I'm a huge fan of the old Conan comics and the original Conan movie with Schwarzenegger and understand the inherent campiness.  He's a barbarian.  He drinks, he kills, he beds women.  He's the James Bond of the Bronze age.  But this movie had the most ridiculuous plot and horrible Syfy channel acting, it took campiness to a new low.  The movie starts with a shot of him in the womb, and his mother getting stabbed in the belly during a battle.  His father then cuts him out of her belly during the battle and has time to raise him in the air.The rest of the movie is just as ridiculous.  There's some people made of sand, the rules of their abilities unexplained, there's a giant squid, there's a pure blood... it's just all crazy.  Just about everyone in the movie, while not exactly A listers, are better than this.  Jason Momoa did a much better job being Conan while playing Khal Drogo in ""Game of Thrones""."
1483927,B00503E9FY,Overpriced DLC,"Ok so Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is finally out and I finally got a chance to play it and here are my thoughts of the game.CampaignThe Campaign picks up from where MW2 left off. If you plan on playing it on Veteran i will admit that its not stupidly annoying like MW2 which was a huge ragefest!!!!!! The campaign is solid and is worthy enough to be that of a sequel.SPEC-OPs SurvivalI've played the Zombie mode in W@W and Black Ops and i wasn't sold on it. Survival adds that element of fun for the ppl who did not like Zombie. After the 1st wave you'll unlock the Armory support, 2nd Wave Explosive and Armor Support, last but not least 3rd Wave Air support. I managed to get to Wave 31 all by myself  until i blew myself up tryna cook a gernade when i saw a Juggernaut coming out of nowhere lol. Unlike Zombie how you can have 4 players, Survival only allows up to 2players which sum ppl might not be to happy about. If you haven't played this mode yet i will say it's definitely worth playing you'll be hooked for hours playing it.SPEC-OPs MissionLike MW2 Spec Ops after you get all 48 stars its not worth playing anymore. Hopefully this time around they'll come out with more mission when they come out with DLC.MultiplayerMW2 all over again.ConclusionBesides the Campaign and Survival the game failed to impress me. IW/Sledgehammer(mostly IW) attempted to make MW3 have that COD4 gameplay style but fell short horribly. The multiplayer maps are god awful and it still has that MW2 gameplay style. This game would of been better off as a $30 DLC to MW2 rather then a brand new $60 game. Rent it or wait for a lower price!"
1419806,B001H4NMNA,Boy That's Some Bright LED's,"Just like the picture shows, you can dock two PS3 controllers right into this charging station. The controllers charge very quickly, and it makes for a great storage spot. There's two USB ports on the side, so you can actually plug in two mini USB cords and charge a total of 4 controllers at once (not a pretty solution, but it works).The pro and the con to this device - those LED's are BRIGHT. When the unit is charging the clear plastic docking piece glows red. Once fully charged that plastic glows green. It's a very cool look, I like it a lot. But darn it if it isn't bright. Energizer could have dropped the brightness by 1/2 easily.Construction of this device is good and solid. I like the look a lot. Definately way better than all those stupid USB cords dangling off the front of your beautiful PS3."
1645446,B004YV80O4,Not much flavor,I really wanted to like this product but found that it really did not have much flavor.  I had to add some grated Romano cheese to it to make it more palatable.  The picture on the package does not look anything like the end product.The pasta did not cook evenly and ended with some falling apart while other bits were still tough and chewy.I certainly would not purchase it at the regular price.

506241,B00BMQQSJS,Not Good at Removing Stains,"If you are like me, laundry is a chore that must be done. It is not like our ancestors where we actually have to scrub the clothes by hand, but nonetheless, it feels laborious. So anything that we can buy to make the process run more smoothly and efficiently is always welcome.This is where this product fails miserably. It makes you work. The container had two spouts for different kinds of stains. The idea is to use both spouts and then rub the solution together. That's the first problem. To squeeze out both spouts takes finesse. They do not come out evenly and one spout always dominates. The second problem is one has to rub-again extra effort needed. The third issue is that if you leave the solution on longer than five minutes, it may bleach the clothes.This product is way too much work for a task that is already at the bottom of my to do list. Now I would give in a little if the product actually worked well, but it does not. And I do not know if it is a user issue or the product itself. I have tried many laundry stain removers-oxy clean gel, spray in wash( which this is now called) shout, and oxy clean powder. The only one that I have found that works reasonably well is oxy clean the powder.Take it from a laundry pro, this is not a stain remover that does it job."
3686145,B003ARUKTG,Inconvenient,"My dog only plays with toys that involve getting treats so I ordered this and the wobble kong.  This toy works as expected, except that it's a hard smooth plastic, so once she gets going with it, it easily rockets across the floor, banging hard against the hard wood floor and the walls, and often gets trapped under couches and whatnot.  The wobble kong serves the same function but doesn't knock hard against things or get lost."
1298346,B000EEK4VM,"Cheep, fell apart the 2nd use","Lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? WRONG! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name. What a let down. on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. Already ordered a different one to replace it. One thing I cant stand is inferior tools."
3705375,B004QLX0LA,Very Happy With Rachel Rays Dog  Products,I purchased this on June 26th and received in a few days. The price was very good & free shipping. My 10lb minpin loves this food and does literally high jumps while I am putting it in his bowl at meal time. He has skin allergies and so when it comes to feeding him meals and treats I always look for all natural products. I definitely think the quality is in this product and the price is affordable even on a tight budget. For me the 14lb bag goes a long way but for people with multiple large dogs I could see where it would go fast. I felt that way about this very food in the 6lb bag. I do think a lot of thought and care should be put into what goes into your pet and I feel Rachel's line of dog products is looking out for the best interest of our pets.
3072054,B001EHF3RS,"A wondrous entertaining ""discovery""","As I have previously indicated on this board, my ""discovery"" of this very fine British spy thriller began with Season seven (7),  After becoming completely besotted with  this BBC  series I started procuring  the seasons that lead up to season seven (7) and now I am at Season six(6) of this great series.  Season six (6) on five (5) discs with ten (10) episodes entertained me greatly.  Season six (6), is filled with loads of breathtaking tense dramas, and lots of ""high tech"" wizardry, that I love.I am ""hooked""  on the MI-5 spy thriller series and I will continue to purchase future seasons."
1297997,B000BKY8CU,Simple and sturdy,"I bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard. It was already assembled right out of the box, and seems well padded and sturdy. My daughter likes it. I like the price because of the special deal from Amazon."
1301387,B0037M62M8,Not for me!,The material used is fine.  The looks are fine.  The length is horrible.  This is too short for most adults that play guitar.  It felt like I was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders.  I attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what I could use.  To me this was a worthless purchase.  I just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again.
3740847,B00II743LY,It Works!,"I have two very well behaved dogs who sometimes bark when they go outside at the neighbor!  I use Pet Corrector once, and they come running back in.  I never let them see the can but rather surprise them with the &#34;sound&#34;.  I put the can away once they are in.  I really like this product and would recommend it.  I also purchased the smaller one to take on walks but have not had to use it yet."
1364782,B000AVBFU8,Didn't Like the Combat Experience,"I don't like RPG's where you only control one character in the party, and the computer controls everyone else.  I want to be able to control every action; that's how I prefer to play RPG's.  Therefore, I did not like this game, despite the good setting (though the story was generic, the ~10 hours I played through).  I'm sure other reviews cover the positives, but this negative was enough that I stopped after [constantly] replaying content because the AI was another hostile enemy.  This may give the impression the game is hard, but it isn't.  I could see how to beat every battle, if only the AI would cooperate.  It would not combo with me, and it would not heal me. I was not interested in repeatedly grinding so my main character could one-shot everything, not with *that* combat system.  YMMV."
3750099,B000RGQ4Q6,Good but doesn't last long,"I've never seen any wiper blade that can last for more than a year under New England weather condition, these wipers aren't an exception, other than that, they work very well, nice, smooth and quiet, this is my 2nd pairs of them, I tent to stock them up whenever Amazon or auto part stores have them on sale, $22 per blade isn't worth it (as I mentioned, no blade will last more than a year...)"
2821625,B000AYNG1G,Modern Retailing Run Rampant,"Before you ever set foot in a Wal-Mart store again, see this movie. Sure, you've heard they are greedy capitalists, and not very good to their employees. But I'm betting you didn't know just how bad they are in how many ways if you haven't seen this film.The most heartbreaking part for me was the look into the Wal-Mart suppliers all around the world. Like China, where employees work incredibly long hours for incredibly low pay, under terrible conditions. When the Wal-Mart ""inspectors"" come to review the working conditions, they send word in advance so that the managers can brief people in what to say (or more significantly, what not to say), and they can clean up the place and let the inspectors take home a satisfactory report.The film points out that Wal-Mart gets huge government subsidies in a variety of ways. One way is to direct their employees to government services such as medicaid and WIC for which they are eligible because their income is so low. Their techniques for quashing any attempt at union organizing are detailed. Irony abounds: in a segment on safety in the parking lot, one store where a woman was abducted had the abduction on film, even though there was no one watching the security cameras. They had been installed to record union organizing activity in the parking lot so as to identify and eliminate employees who talked to union organizers.You'd think the number of lawsuits against the company might tell them something, but apparently it is more cost-effective to pay off when necessary rather than to correct their practices.The good news is that the film ends on a positive note, showing how many communities have managed to keep Wal-Mart out of their area. Yes, it takes organizing and fighting, but it can be done."
1329436,B00005UNWB,Nothing like a good old fashioned riot,"I don't know what to make of this game. I think the idea is for it to be serious, but I wound up laughing at this game while playing it. You are going against the corporation and all h*ll breaks loose. For that matter, everything breaks loose. The crowd is all rioting by breaking into stores and stealling. You go around with your trusty baseball bat and club people to a nice pulp. But wait till the cops get a hold of you. You won't be a happy camper for long. Basically, the idea is interesting, if not a little warped. But the final verdict is that it is boring to play and has very little story line, if any, to keep you wanting more. I would say I got a few good laughs out of it. You haven't lived until you have seen a town go on a riot rampage. Speaks volumes about how RockStar sees society. Lots of people were looking forward to this game. It is luck that there wasn't a riot after they found out how poor the game was. Good thing I only borrowed the game."
1381470,B000K1CS5Y,"Cheap, low quality","At the start, the controller seems nice. It's light, and the buttons are easy to use. However, after about two months of use, the joysticks start to wear down. After about four months, they are almost unusable. They are poorly made, and can't stand even a tiny drop. And let's face it, it is very possiblr. Inside (because I wanted to see if I could adjust the wore dwn joysticks) the battery is just loosely hanging there, as are all of the parts. Don't buy this, save for a dualshock 3. It is more expensive, but it's better than buying a new sixaxis ever few months."
3619759,B0009ZBKG4,like it,The directions  on how to size it were easy to follow.  The price was $10.00 less than every place in town.  I can walk my 70 pound goldendoodle in this harness with one arm and hold my tiny chihuahua in my other arm without worrying about losing control of the goldendoodle. Works great.
90338,B0085JRQG4,broken clip is common,"I bought 23 of these and within a month 5 have broken clips. The guys aren't hard on the phones, but if they get caught on anything such as a seat belt or table top then the clip axis points will break. This is a common occurrence looking at other reviews. Even the knockoff replacement holsters have this problem with the clip."
556600,B004I9ZBC6,very good,b sure to watch the information video included before you start with the program. the application works so well that you really don't know it's running.

1834177,B000002GZ1,the start of it all,"Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the &quot;roots of the roots of the roots&quot; of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world."
1642913,B004V3INE2,An excellent flavored coffee that is a favorite of my wife!,This is a good tasting cup of medium strength coffee that has a hint and taste of Kahlua in it.  We like that with the Keurig you can pop in a K-Cup and make a cup or two in just a few minutes.  We make the large cup and sometimes split it as an after dinner coffee or as a special treat in the middle of the day.The taste of Kahlua is just right in the coffee and we both like it.  I like that you can get the taste of Kahlua without the alcohol in the drink.  We recommend it to you.  I have posted a photo for your information.
3593979,B0002AR0HO,Babes kong,When I ordered I believed large meant large. This Kong is more the size of a Yorkie dog. So when you order make sure you are getting the right size. I have to say it bounces good!!!

3506704,B00AZNEW5G,This should of won Best Picture.,Now &#34;Argo&#34; is a very  great film but this film is 10x better.  Where &#34;Argo &#34; glamorized and &#34;beefed up&#34; the story &#34;Zero Dark 30&#34; stays true and the results is a  much better and powerful  story that leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusion.If you missed this at the theaters then makes this a must see.  I don't think children would want to see this but if they do watch it with them.  Not recommended for anyone under 12.

3550710,B00E4AFPJ8,total junk,"I thought this might be a fun movie to watch about Los Vegas, but it was the most boring piece of junk that I've seen in a long time. It starts with the star being horribly scared from an accident in which she was burned and then telling her church that she dosn't believe in God then taking off to Los Vegas to fullfill her list of sins. She is befriended by the bartender and a African American singer and begins to explore the seedier low class side of Vegas. I kept waiting for it to get better, but that never happened. A total waste of time and money."
1302477,B004PFWYL4,Junky,"I ordered one of these (from MF) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work.  Even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case.  But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing.  As for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed.  The other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.Disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case.  The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag.  It also won't stand evenly on end (if that's important to you).On the positive side it's light, it does fit a Telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment.  But do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better.  I have a Musician's Gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all."

I was skeptical about pulling the trigger on this light because of the low price.  I'm so glad I did.  This is my brightest flashlight by far.  Make sure you have good rechargeable batteries to get the full potential.I have to debunk other reviews that advises you have to scroll through the modes.  While it isn't an ideal switch, it does remember the setting you last had it on when you first click it on, and the very next click turns it off.  You won't find yourself fumbling with the modes.  That being said, I'm spoiled by the momentary switch on my Olight M20 and would love to see that quality of a switch here.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to annoy the heck out of their neighbors, flood fields of trees with a bright light, or compete with the largest helicopter spots."

Crystal is best known for her hit ""Gypsy Woman,"" but songs like ""Surprise"" and ""Good Lovin'"" were fan favorites.  It's a nice set list and as mentioned it deserves the remaster treatement."

1645765,B004YV80O4,Skip for the plain regular mixes.,"I'm not sure what I was expecting--maybe dried veggies? But here they are, clumped in smaller packets which you'd all mix up. They look more like seasonings you'd find in ramen packets.You're better off, as another reviewer put, mixing in your own broccoli and chicken.As such, price-wise it's not a bargain. Just buy the regular Velveeta cheese mix to add to your meals. I personally always use less than recommended because it's really heavy. The cheesiest is right."

1783470,B003SVJED2,No issues yet,"I've had two of these for about a year now and have no complaints. They do exactly what they are supposed to do. The only thing I can say in the negative, is that the nightlight feature seems to be dimmer than they were when they were new, though I can't say for sure. They still light up the hallway and kitchen well enough to get around without turning on other lights. Maybe it's just my older eyes!"
830148,B0081SRJSY,Great kindle fire version,"This is a great board game and works very well with the kindle fire.  I have only one complaint about it though when scoring happens at the end of the game there is seemingly no rhyme or reason to which players pieces score in what order so it gets confusing when wanting to track the additions, not only that but the actual point values flash on screen for a quarter of a second and in random positions on the screen. I would like to see a simple text box with the last few players score being updated e.g.Player 1 Field: 8 pts.and so on...Other than that fantastic, hope to see an online multilplayer added and more expansions."

403996,B003V32UDI,A new experience...,"I've never used an electric shaver like this before. About 10 years ago I converted to regular razors, and currently use the Gillette Fusion all the time. In the past (about 15 year ago), I used a cheap Remington electric shaver. With my sensitive skin, I found moving to more traditional razors was better for my skin. Thus, when the opportunity came to try out this nearly $300 razor, I jumped at the chance. I don't necessarily enjoy shaving, but it's one of those things I do to make my wife and others happy (otherwise, I probably wouldn't). My thought was if I could save time and get a shave nearly as close as my Fusion blade, I'd be a happy camper. Again, I'd used a Remington that worked, but wasn't the best experience. Moving to the Norcelo 1290 blew me away. I never thought an electric shaver like this could even exist. It's worth every penny, and could (I assume) save me a bundle if it lasts. Say goodbye to replacement razor blades that are too overpriced anyway.My first time using this was on about 2 days of good stubble. I tried the razor dry, and was pleasantly surprised. The way the head is designed, it truly does contour around your face and does a pretty good job of cutting away successfully. It certainly wasn't as good as my Fusion, but it was close. Close enough that that one use has converted me.Later, I've even tried it with my regular shaving foam, and I felt that brought me to a whole new level. This thing was a much more pleasant experience, much faster, and provided probably 95% the shave that my Fusion did. To me, it was a done deal....and my wife certainly agrees."

Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's just sweet, without much going for it, and without any particular fruit's flavor. Considering the price that it's sold at for such a small bottle of product, I think that there are much better offerings on store (and Amazon's) shelves.I'll stick with my favoredCrystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4). They're cheaper than this MIO product, and that flavor in particular is fresh, crisp, and refreshing-tasting, with just as few calories, and far less food coloring..."
2162861,6301966015,"Funky 60s Look, Some Interesting Scenes, Not Much Else","Gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie (of course, it was just a product of its time--the mid-60s--it's not a film trying to recapture the era..it IS the era). Still the storyline is slim and the going slow. Interesting scenes appear here and there. The parts are definitely better than the whole. There's an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should. Actually, thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was. It's subtle, I'll grant you that. And a nice character study....and yet....?We were counting the minutes left in the film by the end (""Only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives!"") so that's not a good sign."

1874204,B000G1ALRU,Le Sigh....I just don't get the hype,"OK, ""Torn"" is a somewhat acceptable lead single, but what were the producers thinking when they crafted this middling, forgettable album? I think everyone is so caught up in the DC hype, and the additional hype of this having debuted at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100, that they forgot the basis of a good album - the MUSIC.Of which there is none to be found here. Granted, LeToya definitely sounds better than most R&B; vocalists out there today (her desperate need to emulate Mary J.Blige is a little obvious though), but the material lets her down. The song ""Obvious"" is a wonderful showcase for her vocal abilities but then the rest of the album drowns itself in the common references to pimps, ice and clubs. I am so tired of that whole thing, seriously.LeToya is a novelty item in the market right now, thats about it. Does anyone seem themselves playing this five years down the line? I think not.Mildly recommended."

They were much sturdier and more difficult to bend or break. I was very impressed by that. Next, I have thin hair and I noticed I had a few short hairs sprouting on my crown. At first I thought my hair was breaking off and proceeded to panic. Luckily I had an appointment with my stylist the next day. The first thing she said when I sat down was, ""Whoa look at all this new hair growth! What are you doing?"". She confirmed that those short thin hairs were new hair growth. A month later I can say that the crown of my head looks slightly fuller. Hoping this increases over time!"

3761097,B00APL77NW,Huge disappointment,"I had some plans for this that included a Vanguard GAEMS portable gaming system (suitcase with a 19"" monitor in there that also mounts an Xbox or such inside for portable gaming).  The Xbox itself uses 175W, the monitor a fraction of that.  Yet this would power neither of them.  Not concurrently, nor individually.  Nada.I pulled my Harmony remote charging base in the car, tried that, and that would power, so I knew the inverter at least works, and isn't defective.USB charging worked for my tablets and my phone, although it's far more convenient for me to use my dual USB cigarette adapter for things like that, rather than the large box here.The other major complaint I had is the short cable for the cigarette lighter.  Give me something long enough to reach the back of my SUV where I'm more likely to have things set up that need AC power. The provided cable wasn't even long enough to reach from the center mounted dash cigarette jack to the armrest between the seats - a short straight shot.  I had just enough to reach to put the unit on one of the front seats, that was it.  And since not all vehicles have a rear mounted cigarette plug (something I think all auto makers should do) I have no else I can plug it in.Had it worked, I probably would've given it 4 stars, taking one off for the shot cord.  But since this 500W unit couldn't even power something at about 30W, let alone something that's only using 175W, it's completely useless."

3759015,B005ETCIO8,they fail quickly but the vendor tries,"New Review after about 3/4 year.ALL of the lamps that were installed have developed flickers or have just gone out. The vendor readily replaced the first 2-3 that stared flickering within 2 weeks. By now the rest have started flickering and one or two are completely dark.They seem fine if they are not on full-time. ones in the parking/license lights are the first to fail, then the overhead dome lights. the best ones remaining are in the doors, only on when that door is open. The dome lights lasted until one day I had the doors open for an hour or so while cleaning, then a couple of those started flickering.I haven't contacted the vendor again. I don't remember what the warranty is. No sense in going through the trouble to get more of these, just to have them fail.I suspect they are not running an adequate resistor, if any internally; instead pushing for maximum output, which raises temps and lowers lifespan.oh well. May just go back to incandescent.1. light quality: typical slight-blue LED output. They are brighter than incandescent in a non-focused housing like a dome light, and acceptable for clear marker lights, license lights, etc.. very happy with these in interior and puddle lights and dome lights. They throw a lot of flooded light. In a focused lens they are about the same as a filament bulb, just not as much pinpoint focus.2. bulb quality: it's a solid bulb that is a little tight to install, but even in really tight sockets they did not break on me. they run a little warm in always-on use, so i'm not sure what to expect from them long-term. Of the 12 I have installed, 2 have had one element (each bulb has five) start to flicker. the flickering would stop if I pressed on it. The vendor has quickly replaced the bulbs and has said they'll provide 90 day warranty. This works for me.3. price. $10 for 10 LED bulbs is reasonable. Keep in mind, at this price, while some may have given me trouble, the cost is no more than incandescent.4. I'm giving 5 stars because the vendor and the low price makes up for the problems I've seen so far. It's a neat product and affordable to experiment with.EDIT - docking one star to 4. Afte a few months, half of these have lost several LED elements."

1837616,B000002L5U,Beautifully dark chamber pop.,"Echo And The Bunnymen are a gravely underrated post-punk band from Britain, alongside better-known contemporaries such as Joy Division, The Cure, The Smiths, and U2. Their albums had a great deal of influence on the alternative genre, starting back in 1980 with the excellent debut Crocodiles and continuing throughout the '80s.1984's Ocean Rain was perhaps one of their best releases. Similar to its predecessor Porcupine (which is now back in print as a remaster), Ocean Rain features a gorgeous string section that serves to bolster the four-piece band's sound. Compared the more insular and dark, occasionally bleak previous albums, Ocean Rain is brighter and more expansive (dare I say poppier) yet still cryptic and mysterious. It doesn't &quot;rock&quot; as much as some of their previous work, but Ocean Rain still offers plenty of ear candy.The lyrics are full of dark romanticism and ambigious imagery, sung to great effect by Ian McCulloch. His voice recalls the deep, brooding timbre of Jim Morrison (The Doors). Will Sargeant's shimmering guitarwork places him in the echelon of excellent post-punk guitarists such as U2's Edge and Joy Division/New Order's Bernard Sumner, while the rhythm section of Les Pattinson (bass) and Pete de Freitas (drums) is tight and fluid. The strings and other instruments (piano and the occasional woodwinds) are beautiful yet never overwhelm the other instruments in the mix.Some of the Bunnymen's most notable songs can be found here. Silver, Crystal Days, and Seven Seas are all glorious pop gems, while Yo-Yo Man and Nocturnal Me are ominous and memorable. The title track and The Killing Moon rank among the best post-punk tracks ever cut (the latter was featured recently on the Donnie Darko soundtrack, which by the way is an excellent movie). Not all is bliss, however--Thorn Of Crowns is junk, with goofy lyrics and some annoying vocal theatrics by McCulloch, and My Kingdom is a little better but suffers from similar faults. Also the album runs on the short side--skipping over Thorn Of Crowns (like I do) leaves you with only 33 minutes or so of music.Still, this is a classic album that makes a fine introduction to an overlooked and great band. I reccommend it highly, along with Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, and Porcupine."

1762171,B001N1DPDE,"Blunderbuss of knifes, terrible sheath - FOLLOW-UP Review","I originally gave this knife three stars (bad sheath, fat handle, overly heavy knife), but as I spent the hunting season with much better knives on my belt, I just had to revise my original review downward for this cumbersome, clunky pry-bar of a knife.I have several knives that are more practical for my purposes (hunting and back country hiking) than this overweight blunderbuss - the best of these for ""survival"" purposes is an ESEE-6, but other than for chopping wood, I also prefer my ESEE-4 or my Helle laminated blade hunting knife for general purposes in the back country.  Hell, my Leatherman multitool is a better more useful knife than the BK-2.I'm a little surprised by all the positive reviews and honestly I think maybe they were written by Kabar employees or maybe the reviewers have never really hefted a good knife.The only thing this BK-2 has only two things going for it - it's cheap, and it's thick.Here's my original review:The knife is so stout you can chop wood - which also means it is really heavy, but overall I like the knife.  The sheath is very poorly designed.  I used the knife on one hunting trip and two of the 4 screws that hold the belt loop to the sheath came out.  Also the rivet holding the securing strap tore loose.The worst thing is that when it was brand new - before a week of carrying it in the back country, the huge belt loop on the thing makes it impossible to pull the knife with one hand - you need to hold the sheath with one hand and pull the knife out with the other - jeez - what if it was needed in an emergency?Very poor sheath design - I guess that's why the knife is being sold so cheap."

2452689,B0000541W8,A good film...for the first 30 minutes,"&quot;Bless the Child&quot; is a predictable and seriously flawed movie.  There are WAY too many plot twists and special effects that were thrown in for apparently no reason.  I won't blabber on about the story premise, but it was no surprise that the turn of the millenium would foster so many films about the apocalypse.  This film is all over the map and there is no connection to the various avenues that it approaches.Kim Bassinger is her usual twitchy self (why does she DO that?) If you don't know what I am referring to, watch 'The Real McCoy' or 'I Dreamed of Africa' or this film...she has a tendency to twitch whenever she is injured in some way.  Bassinger does well with what she was offered in this part(twitching aside) and manages to invoke emotion and realism in her somewhat altruistic character.  Jimmy Smits performance was a joke.  Should've stayed with NYPD Blue...at least his character had some depth.  Christina Ricci manages to create a believable character that surfaces from the bottom of the barrel to help save the world.  Rufus Sewell's performance was creepy but a little too over the top.  The young actress that portrays Cody does very well with her part and creates a believable and yet chilling Saviour.  The special effects however were beyond cheesy.  Overall, this movie is a dog.  It's barely worth a discount rental."
1819217,B00FN1LP1Y,"Cheaply made, plastic light","I have to say, I was unimpressed by this light from the moment I opened the box.  There are a number of things about this light that disappoint me.  First, there were no instructions, and while with some lights no instructions are necessary, there are some non-standard aspects to this light that could use some explaining.  Nothing so difficult that it can't be figured out, but why no instructions... one page zeroxed - how hard/expensive can it be?Secondly, even though it's USB-rechargeable, the connector is not a standard USB plug, it's the barrel-type of plug that we used to be saddled with before the switch to USB standardized rechargers (remember when you had drawers full of wall warts all with different voltages and connector plugs?  Yeah, the bad old days before everything could be recharged with the same one or two USB cords.) So, rather than being to charge this flashlight anywhere, with any old USB cable that's lying around, you have to keep it close to it's specific cable or you are SOL.Third, it's really lightweight... too lightweight.  It feels like a cheap-o plastic 9-volt flashlight without the battery installed.  The slightest bump will send it flying.Fourth, it's feels really cheaply made.  A single drop and life for this light is probably over.  The housing is thin and feels fragile, but not nearly as fragile-feeling as the lens covers - the clear, thin plastic that covers both the lantern light and the flashlight bulb (LED diode?) seems designed to break.Speaking of design, that's the fifth thing: the design is clunky and rather ugly.  Not that a camping light has to be well-designed, but in this era of nicely-designed products, it's a little unusual to find a product quite this uninspired.  I didn't deduct any stars for the poor design, because it is just a camp light, after all.Overall, this light is just okay, at best.  But it seems destined for the trash way too soon: either it will break or the oddball recharging cable will get lost, but either way, it seems inevitable that this flashlight is not long for this world."

1876301,B000ROA07W,2-1/2 stars -- Why in the world did I listen to this?,"Plies is another rapper that I was introduced to on MTV Hits. I listened to his album The Real Testament, and, well, I'm really not impressed.But I do have to hand it to him. It seems the easy way to get a hit nowadays is to throw T-Pain or Akon on your track, which is probably why the respective songs ""Shawty"" and ""Hypnotized"" had good standings on the Billboard Hot 100. Disposable or not, though, those two songs are a lot better than the rest of the album; the only other song that really stands out is possibly ""Kept It Too Real"", where he laments on how his buddies screwed him over.Everything else pretty much falls flat. First you have the mindless club tracks (""Money Straight""; ""Friday""; ""I Am the Club""); then you have the obligatory sexual songs: ""1 Mo Time"" is ridiculous because even though he cheated on his girl, he asks if they can ""f one mo' time"", and the Tank-assisted ""You"" is so graphic that it would even make Too $hort wince. And ""Goons Lurkin"" is hard to get into because the production as well as Plies' rapping is so slow that it sounds like the song is screwed and chopped, but it isn't.Plies also fails when he tries to tell stories. He tries to pull the race card on ""100 Years"" when he talks about one of his buddies getting locked up; and on ""Runnin My Momma Crazy"", he says he hates driving his mother out of her mind by bangin' in the streets, and if he really wants to stop hurting Momma, there's a simple solution: STOP BANGIN' IN THE STREETS!!! Anyway, ""On My D"" is hard to relate to also, as he talks about self-encouragement by stating that HE'S on his d. Who says that?I was surprised to learn that Plies is 31, because this sounds more like the kind of album that anyone with ""young"" or ""lil"" in front of their name would create. Though this disc would still probably bump in the club, here's the real testament: the album sucks.Anthony Rupert"

But i did have a DC and i have to say it was one of my fave consoles ever.  great graphics, it looks like Ps2 and it looks almost a little better than gamecube.  when i heard a while back that sega was ditching dreamcast, i was so mad, i wondered y because it was such a great console.  So, i think if you are someone out there who wants to play games that areen't up to date, but great, this is the system.  I think that someday, sega should jump back into the marketing and make dreamcast 2, with more power than ps2 or xbox, and come with dvd and net support.  It woulld be great!!"

389496,B0039LMTI8,AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!,"Finally a bikini shaver I've had invented in my head for a while! What took so long?!!! This works VERY well, keeps it clean and short without having to worry about ingrown hairs or itchiness when it grows back, MUCH better than shaving it 100%. This keeps it the perfect length. My only complaint is that couldnt just buy the bikini shaver I had to buy a kit which forced me into buying a razor and lotion which I will NOT use (the lotion has PARABENS in it!!!). They need to sell just the bikini shaver by itself. Also I was shocked in find out it was disposible not reuseable with replacement heads. They should make it with replacement heads. All in all this product is AWESOME. TRUST me if you like it nice neat and trim without it looking all uneven trying not to cut yourself with scissors this product is def. for you, I""M SOLD!!!!"

1331465,B00006418I,Wireless done to perfection,"I received a Wave Bird controller as a present recently, and am completely taken with it.  It is very similar to the standard GameCube controllers, with the addition of a small platform on the bottom & a battery pack for the two (included) AA batteries...none of which is really noticeable during gameplay.The control is precise...I have noticed no lag, nor has the control ever been interrupted due to it pointing the wrong direction or something coming between it and the system.  In fact, we tested it for range, and I was able to work the control from my back yard, with the door closed...a range of somewhere around 60-70 feet!!!  No, most people aren't going to be using it from this far away, but it is nice to know the radio signal is that strong.  You can rest assured that your signal won't be cut off at a crucial moment in your game.Being a user who frequently utilizes all four controller ports, this is wonderful.  We continually get cords tangled, or the dog runs by & knocks one out...with this controller, all there is is the controller itself and a small receiver that plugs into the Gamecube.  The receiver can be attuned to several different frequencies, so you can indeed use four of these at once without encountering interference.The Wave Bird controller is a fantastic value...after the recent price drop, I was pondering buying a couple more standard Nintendo controllers to replace the third party controllers I have, but not any more...it is completely worth the extra money to pick up one of these instead."

2750804,B0006A9FQY,Barely a rental,"I cant believe some clown from Tennessee gave this movie 5 stars (maybe he helped produce it). We are talking 5 stars? ""best movie you ever seen""!! Phfft! stick to the Jack Daniels dude!Let me summarize: Low budget, bad acting, picture quality was better than most B horror movies, even though it was a dark picture (even in the sunlight), stupid, and unoriginal. How was it unoriginal? Most horror movies are ripped off ideas of others, but this one steals almost everything from `wrong turn' and `blair witch'. How was it stupid? Add the bad acting on top of the terrible lines and you have the recipe for vomit. One point I should add, I think this movie was going for the record of saying the F word (which I'm not an old prude by any means) I just thought it was out of place, and actually stated getting retard. (especially when you have managed to fit the F word 3 times in the same sentence, as a verb, noun, and adjective) I'm all for profanity, it makes me laugh, but I wasn't laughing, it just didn't fit in when it was being said. Very poor writing. Next, My biggest complaint of all was IT IS BORING!!!!!!!!! The girls go for a walk in a mind field of bear traps that last for  of the movie. The guys hunt the inside of the house for 2/4 of the movie. You will be bored out of your brain just waiting for these people to become the obvious victims they were meant to be.Summary: its defecation, however I gave it an extra star for what minimal blood it did have, especially what he does to his mother. Plus the extra star is for the picture quality (usually on movies with this low budget you tend to get a grainy picture).P.S. I can't believe how much they are trying to sell the piece of garbage for. I laugh at all who buy it."
1832056,B000002AEN,sweet sweet blues,"This is simply the smoothest blues i've ever heard. His incredibly fluid and smooth playing style is like a steady flow of water. Im also amazed at how one man could create such a sound with a guitar and sing at the same time. This music is also incredibly happy sounding for blues, the lyrics are rather sad, but the pretty way he sings them makes it very sweet sounding. This music reminds me less of the old delta blues (even though thats what it is) but sounds more like music from the hills, almost as if there is a folky feel to it. This is definately a great addition to anybodies blues collection, and i thoroughly suggest anybody who is interested in the blues to check this out."
1354516,B0002RQ3J8,Brawlers are not platformers,"I'm actually playing through this series backwards. I bought the 3rd game despite it getting critically panned and I liked it, so I figured I'd give the second game a try too. Unfortunately, this game deserves its horrible reviews.The thing that seperates this game from the third (and probably the first) is the platforming elements. Like a 3rd-person action game you'll be forced to hop across platforms, activate switches by jumping on them, etc. This part of the game fails miserably. Jumping is a stiff and painful affair, and you'll fall to your death several times in some of the levels. Making matters worse is that once you lose all your life, it's back to the beginning. No mid-level saves here to make things easier. Removing these platforming elements could have made the game a lot more enjoyable.Really, Konami forgot they were making a brawler here. Horrible jumping sections aside, the levels aren't that populated with bad guys and the attack combos aren't satisfying. The old arcade game (which can be unlocked on this disc) was called a button-masher for a reason. It threw so many enemies at you that you were busy mashing buttons to stay alive. What TMNT 2 ends up being is neither a good adventure game nor a good brawler game. And in the oddest trick of all, it asks all players to share a life bar. I guess this was to encourage cooperation to protect less experienced players, but what it really does is put the burden on that player to not screw things up for everyone.It's unfortunate the gameplay stinks, because the production values are decent. I like the cel-shaded look, they got the cartoon voice actors to reprise their roles, and use a lot of clips from the series. There's even some ""new"" animation in here, but its off-model and stiffer than a bad anime program. Whatever. And again, the inclusion of the classic arcade game is a huge bonus.I really can't recommend TMNT 2, except it might be worth it if you unlock the arcade game, which is buried reasonably far in the main levels. Unless you collect all things Turtles, skip this one and grab the third one, which is a real button-masher and not this sorry excuse for fun."
1302734,B0053CUHMG,Nice Ukulele: Too bad it's defective. Gibson quality control shouldn't have missed. Otherwise I would give it a 4-Star Rating.,"I really like Epiphone products. They are well-made, easy to play guitars. I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back. But, I received this Uke defective. I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I couldn't here anything at all. Totally dead. There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down. I'm disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory. I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him. I just requested a return/exchange from Amazon. If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me. I seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon. I had to send back my Dean 12 string elec-acoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem.  I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically.  The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture. If this Uke was working 100% I would have given it a 4 or 5."

This was a downgrade of my other psp, this psp feels like its made of even cheaper materials than my psp 2000. The mic works fine and the keys feel better too, but I rather have a better screen.  If you already have a psp, don't bother with this version.If you don't care for the lines, then get this, the screen has more vibrant colors and looks not as blurry as the older psp."
151935,B00BQ2Y3TA,Really poor quality case,"I've had this case for less than a month and it is already faking apart. The rubber that surrounds the front edge of the car is already coming off of the plastic. There are odd feeling nubs in the rubber in certain areas and strands of it in others. All in all, it's not even worth the cheap price I paid for it unfortunately and now I'm out that money and will have to order a new case."

1298212,B000EE8YPK,Input jack bad...,"This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input."

1299821,B00154OJOI,Too flimsy,"In an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, I decided to dive in and give these a go.  They are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick.  I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just can't compete.  Not only were they too flimsy, but when I played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands.  This was a huge disappointment."
1832079,B000002AH6,At least as good as the original opera,"I was lucky enough to see Gershwin's ""Porgy and Bess"" performed in Amsterdam in the fifties, by an excellent group of American musicians, and a great experience it was. Even so, I probably prefer this instrumental version by Evans and Davis. It seems to me that they in more compact fashion distil the very best from Gershwin's music and then proceed to turn it into something all their own.  The result is electrifying in its musicality: stirring, moving, pulsating - any kind of emotional sensation, almost, that is worth having expressed in music. The variety and versatility here, both in musical ideas and emotional range, are to be heard to be believed, not to mention the sheer  beauty of it all. This one is no less satisfying than any of the other recordings Miles did during this period with Gil Evans, and the two men produced some of the most memorable and truly enduring musical experiences of their, or I daresay any, time. A wonderful recording indeed, probably as good a Miles Davis buy as any, which is saying a lot.  - Joost Daalder"

I decided to spend 10 bucks since it has one of my fav.actresses in it (franka ponte). She was great in it and almost had me for the entire movie, but it was just filmed so dark and gloomy that I didn't make it through the end, only about 3/4's the way thru. No fun and not scary. Cool creature concept, but not cool enough to carry the movie."

1860529,B000069HKH,Not Recommended for the Suicidal,"Ugh. Leave it to Springsteen to base an entire freaking album around the horrific events of you-know-when. If some of his earlier work could be criticized for sounding too bombastic and over the top, then THE RISING suffers from the opposite malady. On most of these songs, the individual instruments are buried in an awfully murky mix. The true believers are thrilled to see BS reunited with the E Street Band. But given the production values, he could have recorded this with any bar band from the Jersey shore.As for the quality of the songs themselves, be honest. How many of them would have been good enough to have appeared on DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN? If you can get passed the melodramatic title and lyrics, ""My City of Ruins"" is probably the only one. Maybe three other tunes such as ""Countin' on a Miracle,"" ""Worlds Apart,"" and the title track ""The Rising"" are somewhat distinct, if not necessarily very memorable. The rest are consistent with the bland, depressing, connect-the-dots songwriting that has characterized most of Springsteen's career, especially since the 1980s.And the ungodly hype! The back-to-back appearances on David Letterman were one thing. But when a quasi-articulate rock star is interviewed on Nightline and the Charlie Rose Show like he's the Secretary General of the United Nations, you know things have spun out of control. If Springsteen walks away with an armload of Grammies for this mediocrity, and he probably will, it will only be because the stuffy Grammy voters can't stand Eminem. Once again, Bruce looks like a musical genius by default."

The knobs, covers and tips are all in great shape, however."
1856416,B00005AU9N,ummmm.... no.,"Sorry, but this self-described &quot;important document&quot; doesn't really work. The first 12 or so songs (the supposed lost album) are decent. Actually, &quot;It Always Rains on a Picnic&quot; and &quot;Dukes Up&quot; are two of the band's best songs, but both have long been available on the &quot;Blue Cadet&quot; 7&quot;. The last half however is pretty much-unlistenable in my opinion. Those songs were obviously not intended to be released, and they're nothing more than tossed-off jokes. It's incredibly harsh too (as in trebley) and it just grates.Really, the only previously unavailable song that could be considered essential is the unlisted track (#4). It's very nice. I also have a soft spot for &quot;5-4-3-2-1 Lipsoff&quot;, as the &quot;this Tang is delicious!&quot; line is about the funniest thing ever put to tape, but that too is available on the &quot;Blue Cadet&quot; 7&quot;, which is still in print and easy to find. At any rate, I guess I was expecting something like Pavement's &quot;Westing (By Musket &amp; Sextant)&quot;; a fuzzy snapshot of larval yet obvious genius. That's not what &quot;Sad Sappy Sucker&quot; is. It actually reeks of pathetic crassness: a shameless attempt to cash in on Modest Mouse's success, something I certainly wouldn't put past K Records. Don't fall for it!"

1299208,B000RW0GT6,Seagull S6 Dreadnought,"Seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website, but there is no dealer anywhere near me, so I bought one sight-unseen from Amazon, based on the good reviews. I'm glad to say I can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative design.A traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction.  The narrow, reverse-taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom-heavy look when viewed vertically. Back and sides are cherry with only a light stain, and the binding is dark. The top is natural cedar.As dreadnoughts go, this one is very comfortable to play sitting down. It appears to be based on the Martin outline, but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout. Weight is pleasantly light, and the semi-gloss finish is comfortable to the touch. Players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard, but those with small hands should consider the """"Slim"" version, with a neck 0.08"" narrower at the nut.Sound is what really counts, however, and this Canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there. The maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high-quality, fresh strings, allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up. Overall, it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category, with good volume.Buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer. Both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering, and the truss rod required adjustment (a long-reach hex wrench is included). If you are not experienced in these tasks, a local luthier should do it for no more than $30 or so.Based on sound, playability once adjusted, and construction quality, this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range. It is a real standout in value.Update 8 DEC 2012: The more I play this guitar, the more I love it. It delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought ""snap"", and once the action was dialed in, the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding I didn't fully realize hindered my playing. I am considerng replacing my Takamine mini-jumbo with a Seagull equivalent."

1308745,B00002CF9M,Buy this Game.,"If this game allowed for higher monitor resolutions than 640x480 with 256 colors, I'd have given it a five.  As it stands right now, Diablo 2 is one of the better sequels I have ever played, and an incredible game in its own  right.  Gone are the days of mindlessly choosing a generic character that  more or less plays like any other, you now have 5 distinct classes , and  combined with their abundant skill trees, you're almost guarnteed a unique  experience everytime you start the game over.  Gone are the limited quests  and short playing time, Diablo 2 features almost 20 quests covering A  variety of exotic locales. Play control has been refined, hotkeys made more  plentiful, and the user interface is intuitive.Equipment has more variety,  and your storage space has been increased. Weather effects have been added  for the outdoors location, and they help set a gloomy tone with the eerie  music.  Blizzard retooled everything I disliked about the first one  (cramped inventory, easily accessible cheats, limited quests) and kept the  distinct feel of the original game. There is plenty to like about this  game, and I'm not doing it justice. Buy it."

Damage is fairly realistic and if you mess up your car spins and I think they did a good job on most of it.

I'm fascinated. Well yeah, he's in every episode, and he has all this spiky hair, is 16 years old and probably isn't much over 4 and half feet tall. Yugi has three different colours in his hair--black, red, yellow--and his hair is about 2 feet tall which concerns me since its probably half his overall height (and probably weight). He wears so many belts on his body that I'm worried that he might catch one of his belts on something and sufficate. Was he born that way? How does he keep his head up with 30 pounds of hair on his head? What will happen if his eyeballs fall out of his head? Please help me, I'm confused.I would've given this CD 5 stars because of the voice and Yugi hair and monkey-look on the cover, but when I let my cat Pete have a listen, he ran up into my parents room, crawled under the EVIL bed, and never came out in 2 years. :( He could have been eaten ALIVE by dust bunnies!!"
151897,B00BQ2Y3TA,Great case for the HTC One,"I really liked the case for the HTC One. It is good looking, keeps your phone off the surface either way you flip it, and it has a really snug fit. Takes some effort to get it off so don't be afraid if you can't yank it off on your first try ;) Tthe only downfall was how quickly it got dirty. If you opt for the white case please realize that the edges of this case will get dirty. In my case, they got dirty fairly quickly. I do like the feel of this case and it's transparent case really showcases this beautiful phone. I give it a thumbs up...As much as I love the white case, just be aware of the few flaws I mentioned before you pick it up :D"
1730653,B000IE3ZW8,Terrible,"Bent after one use and fell apart after a dozen uses, when it first marketed about 15 years ago it was a nice product but now it's cheaply made, my original still works great after 15 years, I bought a new one because I wore out the knife."
1704186,B00009YUHK,Costly in money and time,"I would only use the thing outdoors or for large interior jobs with an unfinished floor--at least that is where it would do the smallest harm. I spent much more time prepping and cleaning up after the thing than I would have spent doing my interior painting with a brush and manual roller. It springs leaks freely (dealing with its messes during the job is like following after a puppy that isn't housebroken), oversprays (even with ordinary latex paint), clogs easily, and requires rigorous flushing between uses to protect parts from rust and prevent clogs. I used the product primarily to repaint large interior areas of rough brick, but it performed poorly. I had to immediately follow with a roller to correct drips and ensure that the paint covered the mortar and indentations in the brick. (I finished the rest of the job using a professional grade sprayer that I borrowed from a friend.) The Wagner product would be of negative utility for an ordinary size room with drywall that can be painted with a brush and common roller. I bought the sprayer for $199. I gave it away on Freecycle. I didn't think it conscionable to inflict it on someone who parted with cash."
1534464,B00GV4V8YQ,Love the game. Hate Amazon.,"I bought this as a collection item, not to play. I did, however, buy the game separately. Amazing game. Definitely reaches into the old Final Fantasy roots we all grew up on. A bit repetitive half way into the game, I won't go into spoilers. Easy to level, able to turn off monster aggro, making dungeon crawling a lot easier. User friendly, the interface is very simple. Definteily recommended.If you happen to stumble upon a CE and it's MINT, get it. Amazon clearly didn't think about the &#34;Collector&#34; portion and send probably 95% of amazon buyers the product in a paper bag with no proper packaging. Look at the images. But, this review is about the game, not Amazon disregarding how we all clearly did not receive the product in mint condition."

However, I'm giving it a 2/5 stars because I noticed that it makes their poop smell horrendous. I thought it was just my ducks that stink until I ran out of this product and fed them corn, carrots, lettuce, etc...the smell stopped. I purchased this bag again, and the smell returned. I don't think I'll be purchasing more. Yes, it's good duck food, but the clean up afterwards is brutal."
1731633,B000J0BG7W,Tray is to shallow and sliding mechanism doesn't last.,"I have over 30 yrs experience using tile saws. I literally have used this saw nearly everyday for the past four years in a giant Vegas hotel situation cutting various tiles; ceramic, marble, granite, pavers you name it. My advice is this, buy another brand. I like the motor of this Dewalt as its very strong and have never had a problem with it or its trigger(on button). I like the easy adjustable blade height feature. but thats about it. The tray is way to shallow and I have to add water at least every two days and its always and easily filling up with muck and debris which means alot of clean outs (way to often in my opinion). But the worst part is the sliding table (at least its supposed to slide). It cut out of square since day one, the tray is non adjustable so I have had to compensate using a shim on one corner and Im talking 1/16"" in a 12 inch tile. The wheels that the tray rolls on have way to much going on. There is a plastic guide (which I to ripped out long ago because debris quickly built up around it and made it a non-slider). There are screws hanging out of the metal rolling wheels that the saw is always (and I mean ALWAYS) getting hung up on. I have personally repaired and ground these screws down (one on each wheel)3 times and it works for awhile, then gets bound up once again causing it to lunge and chip tile and thats a pisser. I have had our general repair dept try to fix this problem 2 times as well as our welder. Same results, sorta-works & sorta-rolls for a while then gets hung up. Now maybe we are all a bunch of idiots (possible) or maybe there is way to much crap under this table (probable). So if you want to buy a saw and want it to work nicely (out of square but nicely) then this is the saw for you. But if you want one that will last longer than the warranty than I'd look else where. Whatever you get pay attention to the tray depth and sliding mechanism. Obviously Dewalt didnt. If I could I would give this the motor and pump 5 stars, both have worked great. The tray 2 1/2 stars because its just to shallow and strange. The sliding table gets no stars because its just horrible design and built half assed backwards. I just ordered an MK today and plan to put this Dewalt in the dumpster where it belongs."
3654893,B0018CIPS8,All the cats love it and the price is one of the lowest of the grain free foods...,"I use to feed my cats a low quality food, Science Diet many years ago (I know it isn't as bad as say, Friskies, but bad is still bad) but finding out how the ""big"" brands are full of cast off byproducts and fillers such as corn made me switch.Years later, I rotate about 4 brands. Orijen, Earthborne, this, and Merrick.Pay no attention to the price, and def don't order this online; Pet Supplies Plus has this size for $9.99 and the large bag for about $26.This may not the the ""best"" food at the top of the list, but it is grain free, and the price may be the lowest of all the grain free foods.I have several cats and some of them will eat anything and some of them refuse even treats. All of the cats eat this food.If you are switching your cat from a low quality food like so many of the reviewers PLEASE understand that cats need time to adjust before giving up and buying the cheap stuff again. If your child eats twinkies and hot dogs everyday and one day you hand them a plate of carrots and apples...they aren't going to like it. Many adults would rather have french fries than a salad.When changing a cat's food, you should be mixing it to begin with so that they don't get sick or refuse to eat at all. It makes it harder for them to just pick out the bad food and leave the good food if you mix it. If they still refuse to eat it, try coating it with a gravy or soaking it in boiling water to bring out flavor, putting a little wet food on top or mixed in. Don't just throw up your hands and say ""oh well, I guess I will go to the grocery store and buy the cheap stuff again."" Your cat's health should be more important than that.UPDATE: I have since decided to rotate Orijen, Merrick, and Earthborne instead as I contacted TOTW customer service with a feeding trails question- I wanted to know how the animals were housed and treated, and if they were experimented on. While they said they did not do medical experiments, their answer about housing them in kennels etc. was very evasive and did not address my concerns. When I replied asking for more detailed answers, they never responded. Earthborn did reply and address my concerns and that is my main food now. The Orijen rotates in irregularly as it is more $$."
2956592,B000PE0JJ8,fun concert,"A fun concert in the outdoors in Europe.  The music has a festive, light feel to it and with the crowd you really feel a part of the crowd that was enjoying that warm summer night.  Good on a night when you feel lonely.  The Sheherazade piece has the usual annoying anti-climactic feel to it, but also moments of brilliant and intriguing music.  Other interesting pieces of music are interpolated between parts of the Sheherazade.  The program overall seems a bit random, but all the music is well interpreted.  The most intellectual piece is the opening Mozart Barber of Seriglio overture, after which the classical music equivalents of ear-candy and fluffy marshmellow music take over, but overall the music is intelligent and well-interpreted."
1432443,B002BRZ6UE,"Ehhhhh... it's an OKAY game, or a lil better than okay i guess....","They weren't lying when they said best looking game on consoles, the graphics are pretty neat, in fact when the game first started I must say I WOWed, the scene in the submarine actually made me think that I was so gonna enjoy the game, I was wrong. First of all I want to start with how I hate EA Games, they disappointed us so many times, I don't even have to mention about shift 2 i guess, but anyway I wanted to give this a shot because I love New York and I think CryTek knows what they are doing. That being said this game is not for everyone, why? you might ask, well its very hard, it may not be hard for you but it is very hard for me, its really hard to kill your enemies in distance, and if you get shot couple times you are dead, so the fun factor actually goes away as soon as you started getting killed multiple times in a row, but then again the graphics and the effects are pretty good, oh there is one thing that really pissed me off though like its a huge flaw, when you walk on the streets all the cars (not including service cars such as cop cars or ambulances) are the same, they are fake Mercedes S classes, i mean come on you are spending months on a game like this but can't design a couple cars to throw on the streets? Anyway I ve also noticed that the game is actually pushing the consoles to their limits, like my ps3 actually had to force quit the game once when i was on the tank using rockets and stuff, like i think too much fog and effects caused ps3 to quit the game but It may be my ps3 since its on 10 hours a day, its a slim one. So anyway if you must buy the game go for it, 50 bucks is a little high for it but if you don't mind difficult games this will be a challenging and fun game for you, don't get me wrong I'm still playing it because the story is pretty good, it can be a movie one day."
183180,B00G5VQIMM,"Great value, 2 different USB output posrt car chargers","By Wayland C.This review is from: New Trent (2PCS) Twin-Pack: Dual High-Speed USB Port Car Chargers w/ Free Full Speed Micro-USB Charging Cable - 1pc 15W black and 1pc 15W white (NT85T) (Wireless Phone Accessory)The NewTrent NT85T car charger is an extremely economical and flexible charger. The product is fairly priced with two chargers per box, as well as two micro USB cables. The chargers are flexible with two USB ports per charger, each with different out puts, for a total of 3.1 amps. The ports are clearly labeled as 1 amp and 2.1 amp ports.  The two ports allows for charging both smart phones and tablet computers, along with other USB peripherals.Features for each charger include the following:- 2 ports: two different USB outputs (2.1 amp, 1 amp)- simultaneous charging for two devices- color coded with accent lights: white with orange light; black with blue light- 2 micro USB cablesTested devices: Samsung Galaxy S4, IPad 4, BlueAnt (wireless Bluetooth), NewTrent 38b wireless keyboard, IPod Touch; also used yet not tested on IPhone 5 and IPad mini.Each charger has flexibility with the two different USB ports (3.1 amp total). The micro USB charger was used for smart phone; an Apple USB cord (not included) was used to charge IPad 4. Charge was faster with devices turned off, yet still charged devices when in use. This was extremely convenient while using the IPad in energy draining applications.Pros:- allows for convenient and efficient use of car charging outlets- dual ports allows for charging and use of two devices at the same time- different output ports allows for charging of low amp and higher energy need devicesCons: none to date.Conclusion: this portable device provides a flexible solution to efficiently use and charge phones, tablets and USB devices. As with other NewTrent products, it is extremely well made (i.e. durable) and includes additional features (accent lights, different output ports) not readily available in other car charging units. It is essential for those using spending a great deal of time in their cars; it is essential for long car trips. Certainly the price makes this item extremely attractive!Rating: 5 Star"

1867820,B0002F1G9C,Another 'dumb girl group'...,"The record company hype would have you believe that SAHARA HOTNIGHTS are the successors to the legacy of THE RUNAWAYS.  After hearing ""Jenny Bomb"", and now this CD, I think that the former members of The Runaways should consider suing for defamation.This is a really lame CD, full of trite pop, where every song has a really forced feel to it.  THe focus is on more on vocals here than on previous records.  But as with the instrumentals, there is nothing that distinguishes SAHARA HOTNIGHTS' overall sound from dozens of other femal or female-fronted acts.  The band and record company seem to think that making a lot of videos will sell the music on ""Kiss and Tell"" (they thought the same thing when ""Jenny Bomb"" was new).  Forget it: these firls are just 'plain Janes', not bombshells.  And if they're going to do a lot of videos, they need to think about visual impact. They're not hot at all on camera: they look lik e a bunch of fat girls trying to do Karaoke, not a real rock band.Since SAHARA HOTNIGHTS and their record company focus so heavily on video, they could learn a lot by studying Tanya Tucker, Bloindie, Joan Jett, Lita Ford, Suzi Quatro and other girl rockers who managed to become cool.  Otherwise, I think they're headed down the fast track to oblivion.  But the videos (from ""Jenny Bomb"" and ""Kiss and Tell"") are probably never going to be widely seen. Instead, they'll only serve to prove that bad music on video is still just bad music.WHich brings us back to this CD. It's dull, and frankly, after the first song, I found myself just flipping through the first 15-30 seconds of the remaining tracks, trying to listen for something interesting. For the record, nothing was located.Pass on this CD, and get something worth a listen: by Suzi Quatro, Blondie, The Runaways, Joan Jett, Lita Ford, or even non-rockers like Tanya Tucker and  Joni Mitchell, for that matter."

It's nicely done. Or try camemcamelcamel.Note 2: Shelf life: I have bottles of Nu Finish and also Zymol from about 6 years ago.

289910,B0011DJ650,I tried TWO OTHER popular liquid vitamins; I don't recommend this one either!,"In order to ""compare"" other liquid vitamin brands that exist on Amazon, I purchasedLiquid Life complete nutrition With 144 Nutrients, 32-Ounce Bottle.To my shock AND astonishment, I found out that it contained ASPARTAME! Bleh. For anyone who is not in the know, aspartame is a very toxic sweetener that has been put in chewing gums, diet sodas and many diet products. Sucralose, has also become more popular. To differentiate, aspartame is in the ""blue"" packets of sweeteners. Sucralose is usually in the ""yellow"" or Splenda packets.Regardless, BOTH are toxic. So when I found out thatLiquid Life complete nutrition With 144 Nutrients, 32-Ounce Bottlehad aspartame, I immediatley sent the unopened bottle back to Amazon for a full refund.Next product. I then tried another liquid vitamin:Nature's Way Alive! Liquid, 30 Ounce. Well guess what? I took this product only on two days. Both times after taking it (on two different days), I felt a sensation like I wanted to vomit. It only lasted for about 30 seconds...but it was really gross and uncomfortable. It was as if my body didn't like what was just put in it. It was only a capfull too; it wasn't half a glass or anything like that that I took.It also has ""sorbitol"" in it. The jury is still out on whether ""sorbitol"" is bad for your health. Why chance it though? Even if sorbitol is not ""as bad"" as asapartame, I don't trust ANY artificial sweetener. I also sent that product back as well.Then I tried the product on this page:Organic Life Vitamins 30 Ounces.Peter Gillhams liquid vitamin is probably the ""safest"" one to consume; however, like a previous reviewer mentioned, this product has ""sodium benzoate"" in it. I cannot, nor will I, in good faith recommend any product to take everyday for the rest of your life that has a preservative in it. It also had a really bad aftertaste as well! Bleh.Therefore, I don't recommend this product or any of the liquid vitamins that I have tried.I guess it's now back to regular vitamins, sans the liquid."
3725810,B007X36BSM,Not what I expected,"This was not at all what I expected.  It looks good on the surface, but the ""pee"" area is considerably small.  If you take a good look at the picture, you will see the small tray that slides out for you to empty.  The ""grass"" area drains into a sub area which is the size of the ""grass"".  That area funnels into the small slide out tray. If you decide to get this product, it should definitely be for a small dog and you would likely have to empty it frequently.  If you are using it for an all-day thing, you may want to put something under it, in case of overflow.  You might also consider putting a couple of Bounty paper towels in the tray, to help absorb.  (Bounty absorbs well).  The pull out tray is not very deep,so pulling out a loaded tray could get yukkie.  And, you would have to constantly wash this thing out or it would get nasty fast.BTW--My 10 pound toy poodle sniffed it and walked away (even with the spray).

The finish  is not bad on the outer PVC layer and coated zinc alloy body. Works fine with my mixer. My previous set of cables ( totally 4 cables) , each one of them develop some kind of problem after few months exactly on the same spot. I guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working. I would see how this goes and update the review. If this one also would result in same condition, I would look for something better. The only reason I ordered the same ones again and again was because of the pricing. They are not expensive to replace."
1303571,B008GS9UNQ,"Works great. Big display, small enough for your bag.","I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church.  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;.  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent.  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one.  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone.The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store.  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark.  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need.  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther.  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read.  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are.  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!.Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function.  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off).  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician.  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano.  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes.  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments.The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction.  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark.  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient.  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar."

2424409,B00003CXUX,Only if you like thrill-less thrillers,"Along Came a Spider is Morgan Freeman's second appearance as forensic psychologist Alex Cross. The first was in 1997's Kiss the Girls. This is not a sequel. Cross is a character in a series of books by James Patterson. Like the books they are based on, the movies are thrillers. All thrillers are not created equally, and Along Came a Spider is inferior to its predecessor. Freeman is as good as ever. The movie is full of surprises, and there are indeed some intense moments. The problem is the script. Whenever the movie tries to explain a previous scene, that scene is more full of plot holes than the one it is trying to explain. Still, the movie can prove enjoyable as long as you park your thinking cap next to the popcorn.The movie starts with a wild police pursuit in which Cross' partner is killed. Devastated, Cross goes into seclusion, uncertain whether or not he will be able to work again. Meanwhile, in a posh private school in the District of Columbia, student Megan Rose [Mika Boorem] is kidnapped by a teacher, Gary Sonji [Michael Wincott]. Megan is the daughter of a United States senator. This means that Jezzie Flannigan [Monica Potter], the Secret Service agent assigned to protect the girl, is in a lot of trouble. Cross, drawn against his will into the case, takes her under his wing, and the two set out to find Megan. The road they follow is full of dangerous twists and turns.Besides Freeman and those suspenseful scenes, there are some good elements. I liked Megan, because she is a kid with guts. She is as much heroine as victim, using her wits as often as possible. Wincott makes a convincing villain, effectively utilizing his sinister good looks. The photography is atmospheric and gives the movie a properly creepy look.It's too bad all the good parts of the movie don't make up for the confused plot. It is Sonji who calls Cross after the kidnapping and taunts him into coming out of retirement, but why he does this is never adequately explained. Sonji kidnaps Megan to get to his real target, Megan's best friend at school who is the son of the President of Russia. Why in the world is this kid in an American school? Why didn't Sonji just kidnap him in the first place? These are the kinds of questions many viewers will ask while watching the movie. A thriller generally works through suspension of disbelief. If you don't ask yourself questions until the movie is over, the movie succeeds in its mission. When the questions start during its first half hour, it hasn't done its job properly."

It cooks in 15 minutes at 425 degrees in the oven, which is the quickest oven meal I've made.  Shake 'n Bake makes the pork crispy and stays pretty crispy as a left over.  If you haven't tried it please do, it will be on your regular menu for a long time."

3726024,B007Y47XM8,Useless for my dog and pain to setup,"You initially need to set this up by testing each frequency it comes with to one your dog perks his ears at. Unfortunately it has limited range for one, two you need to point the thing straight at the dog, and three you have to do it when they're calm to get the right frequency. So needless to say it was a pain to setup with a curious and energetic dog.After the frequency is found, i was hopeful it would prove useful in ceasing my dog's barking at occasional passer-bys from the window. Result: My dog didnt care for this things screeching at all and still barked.It has an 'Auto' mode so that if it registers a bark it automatically sends out the frequency. Not sure how this will work unless you have you dog chained to the same place always and have this point at him; because as i said earlier you need to point the thing straight at the dog. and i think everyone just lets their dogs roam around their house. Otherwise you will need to use manual mode, where you press a button each time to send the screech.It also has a confusing interface and is bulky and ugly. It seems like i am biased with nothing positive to say about this but honestly i'm not... Its just utterly useless and more than likely will be the same for you and your dog."

1875297,B000M5B6GK,This took 4 years?,"First off, let me say that from mid 2003 to late 2005, I was a huge Explosions fan. I absolutly loved ""Those Who Tell The Truth,"" and was even more blown away with ""The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place."" When How Strange, Innocence was reissued, I enjoyed it immiediatly. I used to listen to these guys nonstop.Then after a while, I kinda stopped listening to them. I guess I kinda overlistened to it, but I pretty much stopped. I was also going through some different musical phases at the time too. But, I gave the albums a listen just recently, and fell in love with it all over again.So, why am I dissapointed with the new album? Well the main reason is that it took them 4 years to come up with a followup to The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place, and I don't hear any progress or evolution in their sound at all. If you told me that these were outtakes from the last album, I would instantly believe you.4 years is a long time. There are some bands that have evolved with their sound during a hiatus like that. Nine Inch Nails went through a change with The Fragile, and Tool evolved their sound to the max with Laterlus. But Explosions In The Sky are still clinging to what they know. I guess that's good for them, but the formula is getting really predictable now.Plus, the songs are just not as interesting as their earlier work. It all just seems to blend together with no real staying power. I must admit I did like Welcome, Ghosts a bit, and I feel that that is the most powerful song on the album. But, I couldn't really point at any sections and go ""God, that's awesome"" like I did with earlier works.So, in closing, some Explosions fans will enjoy this. Some won't. End of story."

This is after maybe a dozen uses, sometimes less. If these sprayers were included with the products it wouldn't be so bad, but since Griot's sells them separately, this is inexcusable. That they call them the ""finest"" sprayer just makes it worse. I've found the sprayers I can get at my local home improvement store for half the price (including a bottle) are superior to this one. I'll continue to use Griot's other products, but for sprayers I'll look elsewhere."

Once you start playing you'll notice the game feels a lot like Star Wars Battlefront because it was made by the same people. The game sports sub-par graphics that don't do the PSP justice. AVP has an almost non-existent story with no voices just text at the beginning of each mission.The combat is simple and boring with the mashing of the square button or using your special weapons with circle. You can use everything from Predator's spear, to shoulder cannon, to his throwing disc. Every level is laid out the same and is boring and bland. Each mission has you destroying Predator technology or killing Alien husks.Some missions even throw in broken stealth by having you turn on your cloak and running past the brain-dead humans. While AVP MAY entertain you for a short time it's nothing special or worth really checking out."
3692036,B003R0LLIU,"It has CHICKEN, BEEF, PORK FAT!!!","Be aware, the label says: &#34;Animal Fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols&#34;.... My dog is very allergic to chicken, beef and pork. She had tried this food and liked it a lot, but I was unsure about the label and called the Purina 800-number. Unfortunately, they informed me that &#34;animal fat&#34; can be chicken, beef or pork - a non-specified fat. At least, they were apologetic and said they would send me a check to refund my money, since I had already opened the bag. Because I had given my dog one meal, obviously she got sick for couple of days. She did like the flavor, but for allergic dog, AVOID this food.My friend whose dog is also very allergic to chicken, thought this food was poultry-free and for days she could not figure out what was triggering the GI problems. I told that this might contain chicken and as soon as she stopped, the dog got better.I'm just writing the review because I don't want people to be fooled with this food as I did. If you have an allergic dog, it is SO hard to figure out what is wrong, and it is heart breaking so see when they are loosing weight and suffering with bloody diarrhea... It's even harder to find the right food, unless you want to cook for your dog forever (which I was doomed to do for a while).If you have any questions, call Purina, at least they have an excellent consumers' service number 800 7767526 and website: proplan.com.It is misleading and should have the labels changed!!!"

1363528,B000A0EFJW,GRAW IS A GREAT TACTICAL WAR GAME,"Awsome game specially if you are into squat-based tactical shooter games, or even if you dont, I can assure you will have quite a good time playing through the game`s main campaign. I havent played online yet cause I care more about the main campaign, however after I finish it I will connect to xbox live. I have been able to peek at the multiplayer maps and it seemengly runs smoother than the main campaign, like a better frame rate kind of thing. The  graphics of this game are pretty good with very life like enviroments and an exellent recreation of Mexico City. It takes about an hour to get used to the HUD to issue orders to your ghost squat and other gadgets the game offers, but once You feel comfortable with the control scheme you will have such an enjoyable experience. The computer controlled AI, though has to be tewaked quite a bit for near comming games of the series specially for the ghost squat. This game really turned out to be a great game and it shouldnt eventually disappoint anyone. Despite the graphics are trully next gen and realistic when compared to the latest graphical  achievements such as CO4 and uncharted, you would pretty much say that they still can be improved. Yet this a very good looking and playable game. Now I am looking forward to play GRAW2 and RS Vegas which look and play awsome too. By the way amazon offers a very good retail price for this game at $29 us, it is a very good deal. Furthermore, the game came in a very good condition and totally sealed and new. Just keep in mind that it is labeled as greatest hits which has a gray frame and not the whole picture."

1303555,B008BTTQI4,Solid tiny amp at a great price.,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a proud owner of:- Gibson ES125 Acoustic/Electric- Pono MSD-E- Blackheart BH5H- Blackheart BH110- A Weber Vintage Series 10A125 (10 inch, 8 ohm, 30 watts) in an open back, solid pine cabinet- A Jensen Mod 10-50 (10 inch, 4ohm, 50 watts)- All tube Fender Tweed ChampNow that you know the gear I have, what I can play through an amp, and what I can plug an amp head into, I'll sum up my review with this:What you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab, the cables you use, and how clean your power is. Got good gear?  This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny.  I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that's bigger than this amp! Still, it packs a punch.  With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half, I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue.  Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go.  Yes, this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have.  If you want to quietly play along with some tunes, you can.  Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube.  Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7.  I understand that's standard.  A JJ is nice, but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone.  Dig out an old Phillips, RCA, Sylvania, or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother.  I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror: warmed it right up; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still, compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ, this guy does sound more solid state than anything.  BUT, compared to a buddy's Roland and solid state Ampeg, it's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects (reverb, echo, chorus) can get noisy. So, if you like pedals, stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters: a previous reviewer is right.  The external power brick for this guy seems fragile.  I'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp. It's holding up, but one round with my cat and I'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance #1:  One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes.  I found that out quickly.  So, get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp.  I'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance #2:  This is a 20 watt amp, right?  WELL... if you don't run a 4ohm speaker, you won't get all 20 watts.  The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output. (Yes yes... don't quote physics to me.)  At 8ohms, I still get good volume.  But at 16ohms (like my BH110) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp.  That said, I'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab. The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ, while nice, can't put out the low notes like I'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean.  But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance #3: The Micro Terror is so small and so light, it'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord.  Unlike a nice 20 pound amp, the chord won't pull out.  So: BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance #3: The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors... though, it will gouge your floor.And then there's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier: if the power is noisy or ungrounded, you will wind up with hiss no matter what.  I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise.  (If you don't have one, get one.  The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work.)The SummaryAfter all that, I can still say:  I love this little amp!  I've gigged with it and it sings well.  Plus, the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price, you can likely afford to pick up $40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig.  And, for the price, this is a solid 4 star amp.  I know I'm happy."
2324056,6304852770,Michelle Yoeh burns up the screen,Once again Michelle Yoeh burns up the screen. She has got to be one of the best martial artist I have ever seen. She is fast and powerful. She has played with all the Martial Greats. Including Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Jet Li's Fong Sai Yuk I and II. There is allot to be said about this movie but I'll leave it to you to see this classic. The quality of the picture is pretty good but not remastered. Its not from a VHS though. So you do get good quality. And many languages to switch too. The English is timed very well but some of the choices of words for English are funny. But makes for a very good Martial Arts movie.

3403668,B006MOYGYE,Eli Writes Review,"Not a fan of this show.Honestly, cute lovely show but.. every episode is the basically the same. Over and over. I felt like the entire first season was a big circle, to start and end in similar places. (Not quite, so no spoilers.) Above everything else, completely unrealistic. Of course the idea (and plot) are, but how everything functions in every episode left me going ""That would never happen?"". That's probably why this is a TV show but I always think characters need to be relatable. Jane was to, cookie cutter in that stereotypical character that's a huge 'trendsetter that no one realize she's brilliant' kind of way. Cute show, but didn't live up to my expectations. I wanted to love this show I really did. I also personally can't get over the fact that when it comes to 'fashion' that means sporting some seriously weird looking clothes, hair, and accessories. Along with Jane, who's creative and fun, wore the same style every single time we saw her. I get it, she has a tiny waist and likes skirts but can you find other types of outfits Miss Fashionista?"

3754861,B002G244UM,Wow...,"This truly is an absolutely abysmal product. The black brush broke within two minutes of very light usage. Before it broke, the bristles kept falling out, making my attempt at detailing redundant as I had to go back and individually remove these bristles, one by one, since they fell out and flew all over the place. On top of that, the bristles seem to be dyed black. I say this because the second they came in contact with a very light detergent, the color transferred to the surface I was working on and was difficult to clean off. Then the entire brush fell apart. See my uploaded photos. The vent tool is worthless. No dirt would stick to it. All it did was smear the dirt around. And then the white brush... it's too light to do anything productive with. It's like trying to detail with someone's pony tail. It's just floppy and serves no real purpose.I resorted back to using the free toothbrushes I got from a hotel and q-tips.

2083959,6300163601,Car wreck for undersexed juveniles.,"There's no doubt in my mind that the people who created this load of celluloid sewage knew that featuring Bo Derek getting her bones banged just shy of aggravated battery would have a draw, particularly for juveniles with unrestrained hormones. And that's the only reason anyone would watch this movie. The script is straight out of a fantasy contest, the acting abysmal, and the whole premise ludicrous. They do their best to create a fantasy atmosphere, indulging in the beauty of Spain for romantic backdrop and give us a Bo Derek pleading for sex. For most of this movie's audience, that's enough. For lovers (no pun intended) of quality film it isn't even close to a reason to spend a quarter watching this crud. Oh, I admit, I watched it several times whilst in my college years. But that's what college age guys do. And I would venture to guess that the demographic for this movie is 90% male, mostly from 18-30. Frankly, watching Bo get her brains banged out is worth the price of admission, especially for that group. But everything else about this movie isn't just bad, it's purely comical. I wondered to myself what was George Kennedy thinking when he accepted his role in this. If he'd have dug into his Dragline character from ""Cool Hand Luke"" the movie would have at least conceded to it's absurdity and not tried to be taken the least bit seriously. I find it hilarious that Amazon realized this to the point that they conceded by giving out the times in the movie where Bo gets banged. That alone should say something- that anything outside those time slots isn't worth watching. I know lots of 40 somethings that would have liked the same thing for ""Lolita,"" though those encounters are less frequent. All in all, this movie ranks (pun INTENDED) in the hall of fame of incredibly bad movies. The 1 star is for the Bo sex scenes, otherwise, ZERO!"

1874252,B000G73U5Y,Yet another useless Steely Dan compilation,"Question: Did the world really need yet another Steely Dan ""Greatest Hits"" compilation album?Answer: No!There's already ""A Decade Of Steely Dan"", ""Steely Dan - Greatest Hits"", ""Show Biz Kids: The Steely Dan Story 1972-80"" and ""Gold"". Aside from the two tracks from 2VN and EMG this is just simply a waste of money for yet another useless repackaging of SD's back catalog (I'd include the bootlegs but anyone can download them for free from the online ""Steely Dan Archive""...so Google up and grok that).If one really wanted a solid and DEFINITIVE collection then one is better off purchasing the ""Citizen Steely Dan: 1972-1980"" box set which contains ALL of Steely Dan's official studio-released work from that period of time. And, if one's wallet can bear the burden, check out Donald Fagen's ""The Nightfly"", ""Kamakiriad"" and ""Morph The Cat"" and Walter Becker's ""11 Tracks of Whack"". Oh, and don't forget 2VN and EMG.There's your list. Now lay down your Jacksons on some quality Dan."
1861199,B00006JO3X,There's Something Amiss Here....,"While &quot;Floetic&quot; tries very hard to establish and sustain a jazzy/boho vibe, the music and voices just don't mesh. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the brilliant work of true artists like Dana Bryant, Ursula Rucker and D-Knowledge and the recent outpouring of terrific work by Common, The Roots and Meshell NdegeOcello, but compared to them, Floetry sounds hackneyed, trite and uninspired. To quote the hook of one the tracks here; &quot;this ain't my idea of fun at all.&quot; Maybe next time, but for now this just doesn't do it for me. I do give it one star for a cool cover photo, but nice poses do not a good album make. P.S. Michael Jackson's version of &quot;Butterflies&quot; is far superior to the demo version included here."
3013029,B0010X73ZG,Beautiful cinematography.  Terrible script adaptation.,"I usually like the screen adaptations of King's works better than I like the books. Not so with this one. Although the movie is technically brilliant (the effects are gorgeous, the sound amazing), the philosophical aspects of the story are turned into facile, heavyhanded propaganda saved only by the fine cast. Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harding were amazing, but the lesser-known actors were pitch perfect. William Sadler was great, really great.I won't spoil the ending. I will say that I thought it sacrificed coherence for shock value and that I didn't like it. I did like the performances and the work done by the drew. It was only the adaptation of the story I didn't like."
2199179,6302449227,Into the Wild,"""Burden of Dreams"" is an electrifying documentary about the making ofFitzcarraldo. Like the fictional character Fitzcarraldo who is driven to open an opera house in the Amazon rainforest, so is director Werner Herzog driven to make an epic in the rainforest. He faces tribal feuds, Jason Robards bowing out due to illness, and Mick Jagger leaving to make the albumTattoo You (Reis). Production is constantly delayed... and there's the matter of getting a steamer over a mountain.""Burden of Dreams"" takes you into the forests of Herzog's psyche. He feels a deep kinship with Nature and the natives. Unlike James Cameron in the ""save the rainforest""Avatar, Herzog doesn't romanticize Nature. He goes into stream of consciousness over ""fornication, obscenity, killing""--a very gloomy Teutonic sense. He has an immense amount of passion over his production. Production starts in 1979--and the whole movie production goes way over the usual allotted time. Watching the documentary, one is amazed that ""Fitzcarraldo"" made it to the screen at all. It's almost like a doomed Terry Gilliam production.""Burden of Dreams"" is a perfect companion to Herzog's other great movies--such asGrizzly Man,about Timothy Treadwell, who died in the Alaskan wilderness, or the madAguirre, the Wrath of God, again set in the rainforest, also starring Klaus Kinski. ""Burdens of Dreams"" shows that in the dream factory of the movies, there are sometimes haunting nightmares."
1803078,B006V6YAPI,"A very modest priced, but really good drill","This is a real power ""pony"" with 300 pound torque priced at just $50.

1787444,B0046LVG16,"Too Heavy, not balanced","I regret buying this ladder.  There is a reason the ladder comes with wheels.  It is very heavy.  The wheels are not very useful because of the low angle you need to get them to engage.  It is a real chore to lug this thing around by myself (especially stairs or tight spaces).  I thought the Little Giant could replace my existing 3 ladders.  However, when I need a ladder now, it is always my last choice, because of the hassle of moving it and setting it up.  Another problem is the hinge design.  A normal ladder has most of the weight on the bottom when extended which makes it easy to move.  The Little Giant has the bulk of the weight on both ends which makes it hard to balance when upright.  Trying to move the ladder around when fully extended is very precarious because it wants to tip over.  Another problem is it is difficult to fully extend because of the weight.  A normal ladder can be placed against a structure and then you can push the extension out.  The Little Giant extension has to swing out which can't be done easily unless it is flat on the ground.  However, trying to lift the fully extended ladder off the ground is a 2 person job (again the top heavy design makes it hard to handle).  For the money, I think you are much better off buying 2 ladders (light weight step and a telescopic).  On the plus side, the heavy weight makes it very sturdy when used in the inverted V position.  It doesn't come with any type of tray or tool holders like a normal step ladder, but they can be purchased separately."

3758688,B004YLKK5Q,Not what was expected,"Did not see anything wrong or damaged on the unit when it delivered so I mounted the part that is when things became apparent that it might be an unanticipated problem.  The first thing I noticed after mounting it and closing the hood was that the design of the unit was going to exaggerate a problem with the hood on the highway or heavy headwinds.  The jeep hood already has a slight issue with catching wind and bouncing up and down, but, the design of this unit has the Deflector jutting straight out before curving upward.  This creates an even larger point to catch wind and creating drag forcing the hood to jump even worse and at lower speeds so you tend to be watching the hood movement even more than normal.  Second issue I had with the part was the quality of the forming, at least with my part.  Once inside the jeep I noticed that the right side looked lower so I checked the mounting and everything was exactly the same as the left side.  Checking closer it was apparent that the right side was slightly misformed, it had more bend than the right so that the top of the deflector was lower(closer) to the hood than the left.  Yes, it is quite noticeable from inside the vehicle but not a huge issue.  Overall I am considering just removing it and not have it on the Wrangler"

3751430,B0014Y82UQ,Not Happy With These Wipers {Updated},"I really do like beam style wipers. They don't rust. They look nicer than the old fashioned style of wiper and they perform better in most instances... except this one.The 22"" ANCO Contour wiper I mounted on the driver's side of my 2007 Hyundai Accent (a parts match fit according to Amazon's part finder) won't conform completely or correctly to the curvature of the windshield. It leaves a section of the windshield partially wiped putting a streak of water a couple inches wide and right in my line of sight. I've tried cleaning the window and wiping down the blade but nothing solves the issue. A visual inspection of the 22"" blade reveals no physical defects or flaws.The 16"" ANCO Contour blade I have installed on the passenger side of my Accent clears the window without this problem.I have also noticed that at highway speeds above 65 MPH both blades seem to lift off the windshield and are less effective at clearing water away even though these blades have a spoiler built into them to cut down on this high speed problem.I really wanted to like these blades. They fit on my car without the need of a bulky and unsightly adapter like some other brands require you to use. Unfortunately looks aren't really an important feature in a wiper blade, performance is. And unfortunately these blades... just don't cut it.{Update}After just a couple weeks on the vehicle the 22"" wiper on the driver's side is leaving a four to six inch wide section of the windshield, right in my line of sight, only partially cleared. Review dropped to one star, blades tossed in the trash."

It wasn't that he was so excited he demolished it, he just very calmly put the end in his molars and the thing just broke into chunks.

I've been looking for a longer lasting chew that's more exciting than antlers, and this is definitely not it."
1757960,B001EC3JME,Not very practical,"My use is for 1"" diameter by 5"" long tactical lights which do not protrude out the bottom.  I also tried it with a 2 C cell light which protrudes out the bottom a lot.I was looking for something either with a flap cover or a snug but easy to insert fit.  This is neither.  It has no cover flap, but has a VERY snug fit on this type of light.  However it is made up of a series of internal flaps and elastic straps you have to guide the light through to get it into this case.  You cannot easily do this one handed as you have to spread two internal flaps apart and hold them that way to insert the light.  In addition if you have to sit/stand as in driving patrol or the like, the light works it's way out the top even if it doesn't protrude out the bottom.  Since there is nothing to lock it in, the movement of sitting and moving around when seated pushes against the bottom squeezing the light upward like squeezing a toothpaste tube.  Eventually it pops out the top.  In addition if your light has a tailcap switch it will get turned on without your knowing it in daytime (you would see the light at night), draining the batteries, as there is nothing protecting the tailcap switch from being pressed against the seat bottom.From my experience with it, this is pretty useless if you are going to be wearing it on a belt in the vertical position, whether a short small diameter or longer larger diameter light.  As a temporary worklight holder it isn't bad, but how often do you need a worklight on your belt?"

2508348,B00005JMUA,HUGE let-down...nowhere near as entertaining as Vol. 1,"It should be remembered that ""Kill Bill"" is essentially one movie split into two out of running length necessity; the (rather sensible) logic was that NO ONE would be able to take in a single feature that ran 248 minutes (just over 4 hours) in length.So what you have is a similar situation with ""Kill Bill"" as with Tarantino's last full-length film ""Jackie Brown""; a good movie that (in my opinion) simply runs too darn long.""Kill Bill"" peaked with ""Volume 1"", a movie that ran at just under two hours but seemed to go by much quicker, ham-fisted dialogue notwithstanding.  ""Volume 2"" is actually over two hours but seems to go by a third as fast.  ""Volume 2"" features much more introspection and less action than ""Volume 1""...and as a result the plot just drags.  Introspection is well-used in a movie where there is a level of intrigue involved (see prior Tarantino examples ""Reservoir Dogs"" and even ""Pulp Fiction"" to a degree), but in an action spectacular like ""Kill Bill"" it does nothing but slow things down...BADLY.  The flashback sequences do this movie no favors (unlike ""Volume 1"", where the flashback involving Oren Ishii actually was one of that movie's true highlights), and the personalities of the remaining ""deadly vipers"" simply aren't as powerful as those slain (perhaps prematurely, in terms of plot pacing) in the first movie.That in itself could perhaps be forgiven...but the final act is such a tremendous letdown.  What should have been an epic battle between two warriors built up over nearly four hours of screentime as demigod-like figures is unforgiveably underdone.  David Carradine once infamously got on martial arts/action cinema icon Chuck Norris' bad side by failing to pull his punches in the filming of ""Lone Wolf McQuade""; that and his history as Kwai Chang Caine would seem to warrant a more pronounced presence in the final confrontation.  But four hours of plot development (again with a reference to the length of the movies; I do apologize, but it does much to color my overall impression of both films as a whole) leads up to a fight sequence that lasts perhaps a minute, if even that?  That may be well and good for Sergio Leone pictures where the pull of a trigger takes but a second and ends a life equally as efficiently, but a good martial arts movie demands MORE and SUSTAINED ACTION (see ""Enter The Dragon"", ""Return Of The Dragon"" ""Project A"", and basically any Bruce Lee and/or Jackie Chan movie ever made for reference).  The Bride's fight with Copperhead and GoGo from ""Volume 1"" was far more exhilerating and much more worthy of a climactic ending than the inevitable showdown between Bill and The Bride (whose name, finally revealed, is one of the coolest things about this movie).Logically speaking, anyone who likes ""Volume 1"" should want to see ""Volume 2"".  However, while I can recommend buying ""Volume 1"", I can't in good faith say that my money was well-spent when I bought the concluding DVD.  I believe, knowing what I know now, I would have felt better with the story ending unresolved."

3287270,B004EPYZU8,"Guns, Garters and Cross-Genre-Neo-Retro-Anime-Live-Action Goodness!","There a many reasons I was (and remain) excited for the release of Suckerpunch:1) An original concept by the director of such Graphic Novel adaptations as 300, Watchmen and the Upcoming Man of Steel Superman reboot project, too.2.) I'm always ready for Retro-Neo-Anime-kick-a$$-Chicks, including the lovely  Emily Browning as an institutionalized girl slated for a lobotomy who escapes to a reality as Babydoll along with 4 equally hot inmates the brash Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-wise Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and dear-reluctant Sweet-Pea (Abbie Cornish) as fact and fiction merge.3.)Suckerpunch is the first mainstream DieselPunk movie since 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' or 'Dark City' although it is not a pure example of the sub-genre as there's modern firearms and fantasy aspects present which diverges from traditional Dieselpunk. If you aren't familiar with the genre DieselPunk it's a term coined by  by game designer Lewis, to include a WW II  look along with stylistic influences of that period like Art Deco, pulp serial film cliffhangers , film noir, even  pinups.Ultimately Suckerpunch's premise of removing us and characters from the 'real'  world provides ammo for over-the-top action, but at the cost of creating cliched characters. While one can make an argument for the archetypes and roles assumed here, it can also be argued it can be too formulaic. The film's action scenes are epic, no question, but opportunities are missed to develop them. In the end a needed narrator closes the gaps in on-screen exposition with what can also be construed as a stylistic element and not a flaw incharacter development or storytelling.The story is largely akin to Alice in Wonderland meets the Anime feature of your choice.,, our incarcerated heroines band together to escape the hands of Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm) by collecting 5 symbolic items,  a map, fire, a knife,  a key and a mystery all while building their own sense of self-worth, of course.Having grown up with the Star Wars saga, the storytelling aspects of film scoring is a very important consideration for me; here Suckerpunch is a knockout (sorry). The soundtrack merges nicely with it's visuals, single songs framing scenes using clever covers, mash-ups and remixes from Queen, Bjork, The Pixies, The Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Iggy Pop. Some featuring vocals from stars themselves, for example, Emily Browing's cover of Eurythmics'""Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This""Other casting includes Jonathan Perez as Magician,  Vicky Lambert as The Countess, Danny Bristol as Little Tommy Soldier"

The original X-men director went away to do Superman Returns (so he could film an actor who looked like Mr Rieves R.I.P lift things)Whoever the new guy just couldn't seem to create scenes that worked.

They really play well, with strong harmonies and catchy folk/rock tunes that have something to say. The opening song 'The Crane Wife 3' sets the tone beautifully and I was hooked from that moment on. The 4-part second track ('The Island - Come and See - The Landlord's Daughter - You'll Not Feel The Drowning') is just brilliant. You can dance to 'The Perfect Crime', rock to 'When the War Came', get mellow over 'Shankhill Butchers' and sing along to 'Sons & Daughters'. There is a wealth of story-telling here and some really good musicianship.There are some albums that you just play over and over again. They become favourites and are like old friends. This is one of those. 'The Crane Wife' deserves to be a success. The Decemberists are a fantastic, inventive band, and I highly recommend this album."
1217721,B00FGQCP6A,not sure,i never played this game it keeps saying something about buying more stuff for the game.would not recommend this game. it looked like it would be fun to play.
1219431,B00FJLK3WU,Very Slow and Unresponsive,"For one, it took FOREVER for the game to load. Then, as I tried to play, it was very unresponsive. Once I got to the forest escape, it froze. This happened twice; when it did this the first time, I redownloaded, thinking it just needed to be refreshed. The second time, I realized that this is currently not a good app. The only good thing is good graphics. With some more work, it could be good, but currently not worth it. :("
108245,B008PTI03M,Not seemingly customized for S3?,Does not really fit that well in that the holes don't line up. I had to enlarge the earphone and charger holes. There is an extra hole on one corner that leaves that corner unpadded! I have never seen an S3 with something that needed a hole on that corner. microphone holes do not line up either.
1699185,B00005A1I0,Scratching my head!,"If someone can explain to me what the tapered design of the inlet and outlets are for, I'll upgrade the review to 5 stars minus 2 for the overbloated price.I can't imagine what the design of a taper is for. The Y-Connectors and Splices do not have a taper. Why do the blastgates do?The problem is that the natural springness of the hose keeps it coming off the tapered outlets just as you're trying to tighten the clamps. This is frustrating to just a wee degree since the problem shouldn't exist at all. In addition, the price is just a tad expensive for a piece of plastic.Look elsewhere if you can find a better design, or a better price. Otherwise, once you have them on, they work as expected."
3258566,B003Y5H53S,Not up to JD' standard,"Sorry, I love JD and enjoy animated features but Rango didn't work for me. The movie doesn't seem to fit into either adult or kid range.

346520,B001U3YA52,Not Wide Enough For An Athletic Shoe,"I do like the arch support and metatarsal support this insert offers, but it is not wide enough to properly fit an athletic shoe. It is too narrow and a bit too thick which causes instability. Would be great if it was wider. I am returning them."

Where is HalfLife(3) when you need it.  I give up (and loose my time and money.) Graphics? Boring... and 'jittery' on a good system. That's all I have to say.
1300021,B0018TIADQ,great product for the price,The stand arrived very quickly.  Came in a few pieces but took all of about 45 seconds to put it together.  the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar.  Excellent product.
1766637,B0027DRU06,Difficult to install,"This unit as others have stated does not &#34;play well&#34; as a replacement unit.  The connections require adaptors, (3/8 to 1/4) which can (and in my case did) lead to leaks and other problems.  The unit also had a leak in the faucet connection which could not be modified and required the return to Amazon.One positive about this unit is that the gooseneck can be rotated and is taller than the competition.  Compared to the unit I did settle on the build quality of this one seemed inferior.I don't recommend this item."
1851502,B000021YQV,The Best Album Of 2001.,"Yes, you read that right. Out of all of 2001's albums, including Slipknot's &quot;Iowa&quot; and Staind's &quot;Break The Cycle&quot; (both great), this one gets the honor of that year's best album. Why, you ask? Because it's amazing. Really.The CD kicks off with &quot;Prison Song&quot;. It's a great song with a funny stop-start intro, and the part where Serj mocks Fred Durst is hilarious. &quot;Needles&quot; is funny, catchy, and hard all at once. At one point the guitars are actually reminiscent of early Metallica. (you heard me) &quot;Deer Dance&quot; is superb, the lyrics are sweet and a great shout-along chorus. &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; is a fast, hard song that's over before you even know what hit you. &quot;X&quot; was awesome at first, but gets old kind of fast. Next we have &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;. Unless you were living under a rock from August 2001 to early 2002, I probably don't need to explain this one. Still, choice song. &quot;Bounce&quot; is probably the only mediocre song on here. &quot;Forest&quot; is just one excellent song, in the vein of &quot;Spiders&quot; from SOAD's first LP. &quot;ATWA&quot; has kind of soft verses, then the chorus hits you and the ending leaves you wanting more. &quot;Science&quot; is quality SOAD with their famous political views. &quot;Shimmy&quot; is just a short but good song, like &quot;X&quot;. &quot;Toxicity&quot;, another single, is just a fantastic song with a great chorus. &quot;Psycho&quot; opens up with a disco-ish beat, then proceeds with singable lyrics. Very nice. Finally, there's &quot;Aerials&quot;, which is a brilliant song.All in all, this album is most certainly an essential, and I recommend it to anyone with a CD player."
1565575,B000MVIGSK,Easy on the Cheesy,"These are very similar to Cheese Puffs. The textures is lighter and there is MUCH less cheese powder. Also, the cheese is a more natural color. They don&#8217;t use neon orange coloring to make them appear more cheesy. I thought these were good, my husband couldn't stop eating them. My 16 month old daughter loved them as well, and I must admit that I felt better about giving her these than I do the Chester Cheetah version of this snack."
1743339,B000RTG012,Cheap plastic clip on hanger hook breaks,Seemed good quality until the first time I knocked it against the wall.  The hanging hook is attached to the cage with a tiny and fragile plastic clamp which is easily broken.  No more hanging light.  Snap-on brand isn't what it use to be.
3635573,B000MD3MIW,Do Not Get This Dog Door!,"I got one of these in Oct 09' and have Not been happy with it For All of the Reasons Others have mentioned.  The plastic is Cheap and not very sturdy. It also does not have a good seal and in the winter, cold air comes streaming in around the sides of the plastic and the flap doesn't close every time.  Way too much cold air blowing into the house and down the hall!  I also do not like the way the security door attaches - pushed on instead of sliding down into a track."
1873877,B000FII324,a Corperate Broke attempt at Gwen Stefani,"sine Nelly Furtado's last album basically went Reynolds Wrap here in the states the Record Company was like we gotta get you some grooves,lets get Timberland. Timberland during the mid to late 90's hit his peak as a Beat-Maker,but never really added anything to himself beyond beats&he eventually fell out of Groove. Nelly Furtado is now forced to play catch up with Gwen Stefani in a attempt at a Accessible sound&style that while has a minute or two coolness,loses it's appeal rather sooner than later. vocally she is a lightweight. her best attempts at coming back are on places where Timberland can't be found.this is only her 3rd release&the record company already is pushing her to being a Gwen Stefani Clone. the irony is that Nelly is more comfortable in this style than what I heard on Gwen's Solo Album,but on the real neither album made much of a impression on me on a whole."
1303461,B007T8OGLK,Great effect after a little touch-up,"When I tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent. Noting that this product comes from China the first thing I suspected was cold solder joints.  I warmed up the soldering iron and opened 'er up and YES!  not only were there cold solder joints but there was a small piece of loose wire shorting components at random. Typical of quality control in the People's Republic of China. A little touch-up with the soldering iron and it's back to normal, whatever that is.  I'm a bit disappointed with the octave but I'm keeping it because it's a good fuzz (and I voided the warranty).  The Normal/Mid-Cut switch is part of why it's a great fuzz.I think I'll replace the Fuzz control with a pot that provides a wider range before going into supersaturation but the rest of the controls I'll leave alone.Dislikes:  quality of Chinese products is a crap shoot.Likes: it's a good, affordable effect"
118572,B0097BEG1C,great quality and price,you can hear so much better with the new apple earpods than other brands.  money well worth it.  only down side is the volume and pause button only works on apple products.  would be great if it worked on android devices as well.
30862,B004886C1G,Solid case,"Got this for my wife's phone. The silicon sleeve is a little thick which is good. The plastic spine holds it snug to the phone. The top ring snaps onto the screen fine. It feels good on the phone, does add some bulk to it but what I wanted was protection for her phone. She has no complaints about it. All the ports are open and not blocked by anything. Case arrived in a timely manner, happy with my purchase."
691367,B0064X7FVE,no problem,I really like it. I read one review stating that the app used up all their battery life even when it was sleeping . After taking it off their battery life was solved. I don't seem to have that problem.
1567355,B000R71WMQ,To Me This is the Best Tasting Mother of All Organic Apple Cider Vinegars,"I buy the gallon jug and divide it into glass bottles, to ensure that the plastic from the bottle doesn't leach into the priceless vinegar. A couple years ago I revised my diet to resume my habit of doing more home meal prep, and am again canning small gourmet batches of fruity things, and even making veggie shrub beverages. When I remembered the healthy role apple cider vinegar played in my grandparents' lives I returned to my habit of taking some daily, either mixed in water or in juice - so I'm using ever more vinegar.That makes it important to buy the right vinegar, the one with the most potential for improving and safeguarding my health. Bragg organic ACV is my only choice for pickling items, salad dressings, and veggie vinegar drinks I make to replace my habitual soda pops.Years ago, when I bought my first bottle of Bragg at a natural foods store (in years) I wasn't knowledgable or discriminating in my use of vinegar, and when, as I got down to the bottom of the bottle, I noticed the filmy swirl I dumped the rest out and bought a second bottle. Eventually I learned that the cloudy web-like strands are called a 'mother' and it is a health benefit. It's proof that the vinegar is live - not deadened through pasteurization and distillation.Mid-20th century commercial vinegars were stripped of their health benefits and produced solely for their aesthetic qualities --- the clearer the better. They even made some pseudo vinegar out of coal tar, of all things, and it was free of all impurities --- especial, it was free of purity, but it looked pretty. I grew up during that turn from natural foodstuffs that were grown in healthy soil, before the oil based fertilizers and chemical pesticides became the standard mode for growing our foods. But I do remember the advent of more perfectly beautiful, and less tasty, produce; and the introduction of such abominations as the TV dinner, and meals out of a box.Thankfully, my grandparents weren't so quick to abandon the whole naturally free-from-added-chemicals produce and meats they had always eaten, and live apple cider vinegar was in regular use in their home. I'm glad to remember Grandpa's recommendations for the many uses of vinegar, such as mixing with honey as a tonic for arthritis, body pains, maintaining healthy blood pressure, rinsing hair, for example.However, for a time I was a gullible young mother of the 60s and fell prey to the conveniences of the supermarket and only pulled out the ACV when a sniffle or sore throat caught up with me. I wasn't impressed by the tonic - but only because I liked buying the modern crystal clear dead vinegars. Of course I didn't know they were dead, that never occurred to me.Through the years I learned more about common contemporary mega-farming, and food production, methods even as I remained in the soda pop generation. But a few signs of aging made me rethink my dietary habits and as a result of that I'm writing this Review.I'm accepting the challenge of taking a mixture of ACV and local honey 3X daily, with the aim of lessening the grip of muscle and tissue aches and stiffness, reducing blood pressure, and making it even easier to climb the six flights of stairs in my home. I've read that it may take 3 months --- and what's that --- 3 months to minimize pains and BP elevation for the rest of my life. This will fit in with my current conditioning program of daily walking the stairs, up to 3 times, and 4 hiking sessions per week, to enhance my organic foods dietary choices. Maybe you'll want to join me in exploring all the uses and benefits of daily intake of Bragg's ACV."
3743255,B0002V9LAW,One of the best metal polishes there is.,"I have used Flitz extensively over a 15 year timeframe.  I used to detail corporate aircraft, and we had large panels of polished aluminum on spinners, nacelles, and leading edges of the wings.  Flitz made the job go quick, and it provided one of the longest lasting results.  Today, I still use it on cars for brightwork, and on jewelry, silverware, and a multitude of other uses.  2 pounds lasts me a long time despite frequent use.  Flitz also does a good job restoring plastic headlight lenses."

128234,B009NISHDM,Very Cheap non functioning chargers,I left my phone to charge overnight to see how well it would work but to my surprise the phone was 1 percent charged. The light on the phone and charger are on showing that it is charging but it means nothing. This product is a phony and I highly recommend that you do not buy this.
3758120,B004G5FKO6,"Product works OK, but it is really a sample/trial pack and they are scented","I'm a car guy who used to own a custom detail shop and who has his cars detailed regularly.  So, I'm going to be a harsh critic of this type of product.This is not a kit that you would keep in your glovebox for quick clean-ups.  In fact, it doesn't even include any cloths.  This is really just a trial pack with 2oz of five of their products, probably intended to get you to buy larger quantities.The products are:""All Purpose"" spray""Window Clear"" spray""Dashboard Protect"" spray""Carpet + Upholstery"" spray""Leather Care"" creamThey all worked OK (not great), but they are also all scented. Some are lemon-orange scented.  Others are lavender scented.  All smell pretty bad, in my opinion.  If I walked out of my detail shop after paying a few hundred bucks, and my car smelled like this, I would not be happy.My only real concern was the leather care - it seems to be very oily and not really like leatherique, saddle soap or other products I use.This stuff might be OK for 90% of people driving around in ordinary cars, but if you are someone who really pays attention to car detailing - you actually own an orbital polisher - this is probably not for you."
1885581,B00DX88EJ0,just ok,"props to  him though for the Trayvon Martin track that is always needed.  and Jaheim vocally is still the truth,now the downside  his material is on the corny side and it doesn't take him as far as he should be. this cat is well over a decade in and still doing dump down  material.  talent is their,however the material on the whole leaves alot to be desired. sad  that this cat has a teddy pendergrass/luther vandross thing with his voice and tone, however he doesn't have the right writer and producer to take him to the next level and to me he has  Unsung written all over him sad to say."
1696459,B00004TI25,Where is the air flow??!,"I've had Milwaukee tools in the past - all great.  Tried to defrost a snow thrower that had frozen with impacted snow from a deep snow fal with this model gunl.  This gun puts out virtually NO AIR FLOW!  It warms to what seems to be an adequate heat, but you have to put the nozzle almost up to or touching the frozen snow, for it to have any melting effect.  You must work along very slowly, inch by inch, to complete the job.  Took me 3/4 of an hour to do what should have been done in 5 minutes.Although my hair dryer doesn't get as hot, it surely blows far harder than this pathetic &#34;gun.&#34;"

417611,B004ASER98,Not for me!,"Would not buy again as it does absolutely nothing for me. I had been using an allergy med, also called ""Loratadine"" for over 2 years now and even though it was not 100% (I don't think any of them are), it brought me a lot of relief over the seasons. Sorry to say this one can't even come close. All over sudden, I get daily sneeze attacks, accompanied by a runny nose, I get dry caughs, and worst of all, I don't believe that this one is non-drowsy. Since taking it, I noticed a get a weird ""whoozy"" feeling ever so often throughout the day. It comes and goes very quickly but is something I never experienced before. I do not take any prescribed medication that an allergy pill would interfere with. I'm really disappointed as the reviews I read were all positive."

1883728,B007U20ZQA,Everything That's Wrong With Pop Music Today,"Hey Kids! Do you wanna know why mainstream pop music sucks today? Well, listen to ""Whistle"" by Flo Rida!Flo Rida keeps digging deeper into his own grave. ""Good Feeling"" and ""Wild Ones"" sound almost exactly the same. They have the same format, a way more talented artist than Flo Rida singing the chorus, verses about partying and having a good time with a catchy beat to match. Now, in context, that doesn't seem that bad, but Flo Rida is so awful at delivering his verses that it just ruins it. He does kind of a ""sing-rap"" kind of thing. It doesn't work. Maybe for Kid Cudi, but not for you. Oh yeah, the lyrics suck, too.With ""Whistle"", he didn't just make the worst song of his career, but probably the second worst song of 2012, behind the God-awful ""Call Me Maybe"". In this track, he's telling a woman to ""blow his whistle"". Then he goes far enough to describe HOW to ""blow his whistle"". As if this woman wouldn't know. The rest of the song are just verses with more innuendo. It's just a sleazy mess.I find it hard to believe that kids these days actually like this. And I'm 14. I would never spend a penny on this crap, yet this song is number 4 in the U.S. This is embarrassing. I looked up the number one single of this week in 2002, ten years ago, and it was ""Hot in Herre"" by Nelly. What a freakin' coincidence. Both artists are basically the same style, ""sing-rapping"", innuendo and talking about having a good time in da club. Flo Rida is the new Nelly, and that's not good."
3760135,B007ZGBLNW,21.6 Watt LED Light,This is the second type of LED light I have tested.  I ordered 2 of these lights.  I measured the Voltage  and current at each light.  Each light came from different suppliers.LED Light 112.612V @1.711A = 21.579 WattsLED Light 212.581V @1.723A = 21.677 WattsThese lights are bright but the DC-DC converter is probably running too low.These might be B stock.While I wrote this review I left LED light 2 on to see what would happen when they got warm.LED Light 212.638V @1.638A = 20.701 WattsI was going to give these 2 stars but I received a refurbished unit.  I sent it back because the lense was cracked and had a poor repair job.  The lenses have to be super cheap I dont know why they bother repairing them.EDIT:  Careful with the lense cover.  I cleaned mine and now it has a white haze to it.
226623,B0009EXOTQ,Fantastic product.,I used to use this daily but now just use it when I feel a little stomach discomfort due to digestibility issues. Originally was consuming gluten products that were difficult for me to digest.

1481497,B004SJA7L6,"gaming on the go, even longer","Nobody knows why the 3ds didn't have a better battery from the start, but this battery pack is the solution if you are still holding out on buying the 3ds xl. It more than doubles the battery life of the 3ds, and it seems to hold a charge longer than other rechargeable batteries I have bought for various electronic devices. With other battery packs, if you don't use them for a long time, they lose too much power and end up being dead. This power pack holds its charge for a long time. The only downside is that if you are trying to power cycle the battery, unless you are playing for a long time, it's hard to get it down to the red. Also, when I first installed this, it messed up my Streetpass functionality, but has since resolved itself and now Streetpass works(update from nintendo maybe?)."

1843728,B0000039QA,Another Biggie Classic,"Hip Hop fans, eager for a follow up to Biggie's magnum opus &quot;Ready To Die&quot; will not be disappointed by his follow up, which he sadly did not live to see the release of. Although, as one reviewer already mentioned, his death helped to sell the album, this album can stand on its own as one of the greatest hip hop albums ever. Almost every song on this album is ganster rap at its best. If you're looking for great beats, this is the album. If you're looking for some of the tightest lyrics in the genre, look no farther. This album has it all.The best songs are: Notorious Thugs, 10 Crack Commandments, I Got A Story To Tell, Kick In The Door, I Love the Dough, and Hypnotize"
1414137,B001BNFQKO,Fun game. Needs TONS of work,"The game is really fun if it actually works right which is about 10%. Here is how I rate itGameplay 4/5: The campaign is fun and has a good story and is entertaining.Graphics 2/5: Don't get me wrong, but the graphics are good but the game eventually fails to load textures after a while and I find myself driving/walking through space and it will not load them. This renders the game unplayable and I find myself having to restart the game about every 15-20 minutes due to this.Online 1/5: Just saying Games for Windows sucks. I wished the disk allowed you to install through Steam instead. It lacks features and Steam is better for an online experience. If it used Steam, I would rate 5/5.Stability 2/5: If I'm not forced to restart the game by the graphics glitches, the game will crash after 20 minutes. The updates fixed it a little but still is pretty unstable.Overall 2.5/5: I had the Xbox version once upon a time before the Xbox died and it was good. I think the game was focused on the console too much and the PC was rushed and poorly ported over. It could of been made alot better and if it was tested a little more, it would be a great game for PC"
1670641,B0096RP84Q,"Wow, is this unhealthy for you!  And wasteful!  With bits of wood!","I usually don't judge a food first by its nutrition information, but in the case of Campbell's Go Soup - Creamy Red Pepper with Smoked Gouda I have to make an exception.  Below I've listed the calorie and fat info from two of the heavier / creamier soups I like and this new Go Soup.  (BTW, I listed the numbers for the entire package - who is going to eat a half a pouch of soup?)18oz can of Progresso Creamy Mushroom - 300 calories, 180 from fat18oz can of Campbell's Chunky New England Clam Chowder - 420 calories, 180 from fat14oz pouch of Creamy Red Pepper and Gouda - 440 calories, 280 from fat (60% of this saturated fat)And of course like most processed soups Campbell's Go Soup - Creamy Red Pepper with Smoked Gouda has sodium up the wazoo as well, 66% of your daily allowance in a single pouch.Other criticisms - the soup itself tasted OK, but not particularly creamy considering the high fat content.  In addition, I encountered both skins (as noted by others) plus several bits of tough inedible woody material - perhaps a bit of pepper stalk, or actual wood, or some other mystery fibrous substance.Lastly, I fail to see anything convenient about the packaging - heat the soup in the bag and pour into a bowl or pour the soup from a can to a bowl and heat - what's the difference?  Oh yeah, this is much more expensive than canned soup, and more wasteful (at least I can recycle the cans).I just can't give a positive rating to a soup that is this unhealthy for you.  Add in the other problems, and I'm sure I would never buy it again.Edit October 2013 - purchased a six-pack sampler of the Campbell's Go soups, which included one of the Red Pepper and Gouda.

1696210,B00004T82P,Well made but unrealistic,"Can't argue with the quality construction, but not very practical once you load it with tools.  A slightly smaller profile that was meant to hold half as many tools would be handier.  And offering in two colors would allow you to grab the roll you needed.  And frankly I'm not fond of the buckles either.  For tool rolls as with tools -- simpler is better.  I wish I hadn't bought it."

13473,B002YFDRHW,The Life Saver,"I have had this batter pack for a long time now, and it has just been the biggest life saver ever. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a little more juice throughout their day. This battery can charge any phone that supports being charged through USB and it can even charge devices with a bigger battery like the iPad. The only complaint I have with this battery is that you need a special cord to charge the iPad (The cord is included!!!)."

This ""snow broom"" is sturdy enough to pull even heavy, dense snow off my car without scratching it. It even retracts and folds up neatly so that it doesn't dominate the floor of my backseat area. It's a little awkward for heavy scraping, but it does work. If you have to park your car outside when it snows, this is a good way to get an overnight's worth of accumulation off of your car."

You will literally get spawned in front of the enemy.- The soldiers appear too small. It's as if the camera zoomed out on every map, makingeverything else smaller.- Overall movement is worse than previous COD games.There are some cool new perks, killstreak rewards, and weapons. But the gameplay is really bad. I regret buying the game and unfortunately, it may be my last COD game. It was great while it lasted. Peace be with you all."

1690940,B0000225HU,Freedom to move about,"I wanted a framing nailer for personal projects so spent considerable time researching on-line at various sites.  I finally called a friend who is a builder and asked what he used and recommended.  He said he owns and uses several different brands of nailers, but when he gets busy on a site he always reaches for his Paslode first.  Based mainly on the recommendation of a professional, I purchased a used Paslode.  My first use has been framing two new rooms in my basement.  Not having to share an enclosed space with my compressor or stretch an air line from outside was famous.  The Paslode was quick, convenient, and worked like a charm.  It's a small thing, but the squared body of the engine lets you lay it down on the floor and the handle remains upright and easy to quickly grab when you need it.  When I first got it I suffered a few misfires and slow operation, so I gave it a thorough cleaning per the operators manual.  The process was relatively simple if you follow the book and the difference was immediate.  It doesn't bump fire, but will spit out fasteners as fast as I can pull the trigger.  The one thing I did not read about in any of my research are the fumes.  Because it uses butane fuel the exhaust has a distinct odor to it.  In an enclosed environment like my basement you really start to notice it after awhile, and it gave me a slight headache until I opened a window.  Bottom line: I do not regret my decision to purchase the Paslode as my only framing nailer.  All my other nailers (Hitachi coil roofing, Bostitch and Senco finish nailers, and Bostitch brad nailer)are air nailers, but for the convenience and ease of use I love just being able to grab my Paslode and drive a few nails without all the setup of compressor and air lines first.  Now I'm looking for more projects so I have an excuse to use it :o)"

Everything from demos to alternate takes bring new light and information to the reader/listener about this masterpice (Please remember that the Beatles were greatly influence and challenged by Pet Sounds to record Sgt. Pepper). Of course, this is no easy listening. This set is best experienced if the listening is done by sections. As the set offers vocal, instrumental, stereo and mono tracks one can undertake each part one by one. The box set if filled with interviews by all of those involved in the making of Pet Sounds as well as commentaries by the likes of George Martin and Paul McCartney.

1410074,B00178630A,Repetitive but really fun,"Im on my 2nd playthrough of the game as a monk on hell mode and the game is still really fun to me. Due to the fact that theres 4 difficulty modes, 5 character classes, millions of items to loot, and an upcoming pvp patch, I think its safe to say this will give me something to do in my downtime over the summer,into winter, and probably into next summer as well :)And as for the mixed reviews, just ignore them :) Most of the 5 stars are just fanboys who LOVE anything related to diablo 2. And most of the 1 star reviews are also fans of diablo 2, but dont like it since its more of a ""mainstream"" game thats tailored to everyone instead of being some ""hardcore"" oldschool game from the 90's that they all grew up on. That, or they dont have internet in there house, which is there fault considering Blizzard REPEATEDLY said that you need a constant internet connection to play since they want to stop piracy.So just go watch a youtube video on some gameplay, pretend your playing it, and if you enjoy it, buy it! And if you think it looks boring, then dont!Its that simple :)"
1847360,B0000089FT,This One Is A Superb Work Of Stunning Genius!,"As the troubled, but at times hopeful 1980&#8217;s came to an end, Elton John againprovided us with another blockbuster hit in 1989 that finds him in top drawer formand back on top of the music charts.  Showcasing its highly versatile combinationof first rate multi-layered keyboard artistry, high voltage rock and roll, R&B;, socialcommentary, solid background, drum and snare back-up and outstanding diversesongs, Sleeping With The Past showcased another powerful masterpiece packeda new set of time-honoured music and utmost musicianship.

Truly hailed as one of his greatestand most important achievements, Sleeping With The Past is a bonafide five starmasterpiece that will live forever on as a timeless testament for Elton and Taupin,and as a time-honoured classic that will remain as aspiring for countless of ages."
1553583,B000FEFEWA,I can finally eat sardines,"Everything you read about healthy eating says to eat sardines (low on fish food chain, Omega 3s, sustainable) but I just couldn't get around the heads and bones. Finally heard about these and tried them (one can from my store first) and they're good. Ordered in bulk from Amazon since the one can I bought at the store was the only can and the only way I'm going to eat these is if I have them around. Just wish the cans opened more easily. Oh, well, maybe with practice I'll get proficient opening and eating them. (OK, they're still new and unusual and aren't the first thing I grab from the pantry.)"
1848761,B00000DLVA,"Those who loved ""Band on the Moon"" might not love this one","On this one, the lyrics take a darker, more cynical tone, (""Do you really think/that love is gonna save the world?"" from ""Do you Believe?"" is just one example) and the music adds quite a bit of electronic elements, even dabbling at times in trip-hop. In and of itself, growth and change is what keeps a band from stagnating, and generally I'm in favour of a band shifting from its strengths and struggling to find new ones.One thing that's non-negotiable in the search for new sounds, though, is strong hooks. The real problem with this album is there aren't enough ""Wow!"" moments: those songs that grab you and make you sing along.FIRST BAND ON THE MOON had ""Lovefool"" and ""Been It"" along with their cover of ""Iron Man"" and ""Never Recover"", all of which became stuck in your head with enough play. That just isn't happening for me with this one for the most part.HIGHLIGHTS:""My Favourite Game"" is the only immediate grabber here and a fairly gritty number for the Cardies. ""Erase/Rewind"" grafts a drum rhythm reminiscent of Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust"" onto a shimmering keyboard part. ""Starter"" is a midtempo trip-hop number about reinventing yourself. (""Turning the pages/I used to hang on to/I was young and I have changed my mind/and I'm leavin' everything behind"")LOWS:""Nil"" is a limp instrumental coda to the CD.BOTTOM LINE:If you loved the bubbly pop of ""First Band on the Moon"", you'll be disappointed in this. Even taken on its own trip-hop terms, I can't really say it compares favourably with Portishead and the like. Color me unimpressed."
1452839,B0030F1DOO,This is not a complete game.,"This game is the biggest disappointment for Playstation 3 ever. I loved the original Force Unleashed, it had both stunning visuals, amazing force effects and a great story. This game to have great visuals and some good force effects, the problem is that there is hardly any story, for the simple reason of the game just being so extremely short. Now in the original part of the fun was unlocking all of the Apprentice's cool force powers, you sort of do some unlocking here to, but the game is just to short for any type of character development.Let me try to illustrate how short this game is. My and my hubby played through the entire game in 3 and a half hours, and let me tell you that we are not good players, we play for the story so a real gamer could probably do it in one and a half hours. Now I know what you are thinking with a storyline so short there have to be multi player, different game play modes, anything to make this game's entertainment value last for more than a few hours, well no there is not, there are a few challenges and a handful of trophies to unlock and that is it. When we finished this game and the credits begun to roll me and hubby actually tried to restart from the last checkpoint as we first believed there had to be some glitch, that it was not possible for a full prized Playstation 3 game to be this short, when we realized there where no glitch we just felt cheated. Yes that is right, I would go so far as to call this game a scam to harvest money of the popularity of the first game while providing no content for the second one.To be fair to the game I have to add that what there is of the game is good, the graphics are beautiful, the sort storyline is good, the controls work wonderfully and had this been a download off Playstation store or a budget title sold as a add on story to the first game then I would have had no problems with it, but that they dare to charge full price for this claiming that it is a full game, that is just an insult to players.If you can find this game very cheaply it might be worth having for the short but good story, or if you can find it for rent you might enjoy it. However be aware that this is not a full game. I have never seen a modern game this short, this game is an attempt to milk money out of fans of the first game while putting in minimal effort. To sum up my feelings on this game let me just say that I am disappointed."

Taste for yourself the difference. I can promise you won't go backMy only complaint is that the cost of these soups have increased on amazon dramatically even with subscribe and save option :("
1744257,B000TEZAQQ,Stylish Brushed Nickel Faucet for a Reasonable Price,"This faucet is extremely easy on the eyes and in my opinion is one of the more stylish faucets I've seen at such a reasonable price. I have to agree with another reviewer though who brought up the point that the faucet is in need of further extension. If the faucet came forward just a bit more, there'd be much more room to wash your hands without worrying about knocking them into the base of the faucet. Great product that works very well, and that one adjustment would move this item into 5 star territory."
1299331,B000T517Y4,"Classic fuzz, compact size","I own several Electro-Harmonix pedals and overall I like the brand (even though the owner appears to me to be a sexist pig clown boy in many of his YouTube videos). Of those I own, two of them are the smaller versions of the GIGANTOR classic E-H pedals, one of them being the Little Big Muff.First of all, if you have no idea of the difference between fuzz, overdrive, and distortion you should look into it before you buy anything. These effects are used in different musical styles and produce different sounds, so your choice will depend on what exactly you plan to do. Do some research by looking on YouTube, looking at Dave Hunter's book on effects, and testing them out at a store.If you are looking for a basic fuzz box, the Little Big Muff will give you nice sound similar to (if not the same) as that of the Big Muff Pi, depending on the exact year/model you have. I think the tone is great, but as with most basic fuzz boxes, there are only so many different sounds that you can get out of them. It is simple to use though, and it makes a lot of noise.As a bonus, these don't take up a lot of pedalboard space compared to the Big Muff Pi, yet will give the same tone. It is great for punk, alt rock/grunge, and classic hard rock like Hendrix and Black Sabbath.I also have a germanium (red) Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini, another good small version of one of the classics, and the Fuzz Face mini that gives you the most low end emphasis of the three (the blue silicon and aqua Hendrix models boost treble more). To quickly compare it to the Little Big Muff regarding sound, the Fuzz Face does not have a tone control, but I think it gives a better control over the fuzz saturation. While the Little Big Muff will give you more control over the tone (EQ), like many EHX pedals it goes from zero to crazy rather quickly. In this case when you begin turning the Sustain, it is not long before you are in very fuzz saturated zone. As you increase the amount of saturation, you get more sustain but less control of the dynamics so all your pick attacks begin to sound the same. So, I'd say while both the red Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini & the Little Big Muff are good tools, each comes with its own disadvantages.Though some E-H units come with power supply, this one does not and you will need to get one unless you like changing batteries. Although few pedals come with power supplies, I think its lame not to include them and you will need to factor it into the cost of the unit.If you are into looking at pretty pedals on your board, then you might be able to find a prettier fuzz box than the stark and dreary industrial-looking Little Big Muff. I like pretty things, but the sound of this unit is too good to pass up and it is a great tool to have in your kit.Bottom line:(1) Gives the classic Big Muff fuzz sound(2) Does not eat up pedalboard space like the old GIGANTOR models(3) Noisy (not always in a good way) when on, but has true bypass when off(4) Has tone control (EQ), but the ""Sustain"" saturates very quickly so you get less fuzz control (limits dynamic control of your picking)(4) Simple to use, but limited sound palette(5) Decent price, but power supply sold separately(6) Bleak appearance (not shiny, colorful, or sparkly)"
3750166,B000RXKR6M,The only wash mitt you should let touch your car!,"After using several different mitts and towels to wash cars my whole life, I stumbled on one of these. I think it is extremely soft for a microfiber mitt, very gentle on my delicate paint jobs. I've never had an issue with it micro-marring anything, so I would imagine it does a good job at keeping any dirt that does inevitably get caught in it - off of your paint/clear coat.It's still good to take precaution with it and any mitt: Use an absolutely clean bucket, use a grit guard or something similar if you can. I usually run my hand through it everytime I dunk it (before and after), just to make sure theres no noticable hard dirt/small rocks, anything that could mar. Try to spray wash the car first to get off any thick dirt, and dont clean your dirty wheels then touch your car paint with it.Other then the above: it's a great cheap mitt that is the only thing I'll trust to touch the paint job on my cars, it's large and quite absorbent, it's machine washable, and should last you for at least a year - depending how much you use it."
1746914,B000WER5SE,all around great package,"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between."
1841801,B000002U84,"Hungry like the wolf, empty like its stomach","Words resurrected from the netherworld and assembled in a manner that could be called abstract, if Slick Rich could sing it like that.  Musical arrangements as flat and colourless as a razor blade.  Like a razor blade, it seems pleasing and smooth at first.  Then one really listens and discovers that, actually, this baby is nasty, sharp, and dangerous.  Since it's one of the best examples of the soulless, superficially-divine pop of the Eighties, the album's artifactual; but unless this became a personal favourite as you were growing up in that period, just leave it on the shelf--or better yet, in the closet."

1443401,B002I0J5FG,Don't do it!,"I would only suggest purchasing this game if you want to play through it once then trade it for something with actual replay value. Both games are typical dated puzzle-platformers, although Shadow of the Colossus has some action elements added. Both games also suffer from an empty, lifeless environment that was no doubt the writer's intent but doesn't make for very exciting gaming.Ico in particular gets extremely boring as you yank some girl around by the arm through a crumbling castle, looking for ladders and and hidden passageways. This gets extremely repetitive, especially when you finish one half of the castle and have to repeat the same unlock procedure on the other half which is an exact mirror image (yes, really). I don't know if it is just me, but the slow pace and emotional focus of the game is extremely draining to play, luckily the game is short and can be beaten in one sitting. The The HD service given to Ico seems incomplete as well; when running through these simple Super-Nintendo graphics you suddenly come upon a single rusty pipe or chain redone with a 1080p texture that looks so clean and sharp that the rest of the screen suddenly appears ridiculous. The lighting effects are also so poor that when brightness is set to maximum, a few of the doors are completely within shadows that make them impossible to see whilst the girl will look so bright and washed out that she will be almost invisible when outdoors... another indicator of a poorly made HD refinishing.Shadow of Colossus looks much better: the horse in particular, while not being on par with Red Dead or Assassin's Creed, looks very smooth and lifelike. The gameplay is very bumpy however, involving traversing across massive landscapes that I'm sure were breathtaking in 2005 or whenever. The problem is that there is literally nothing in this land besides rocks and trees, so you are just holding the forward button and trying to stay awake long enough to reach your next target. The boss battles are all basically the same as well: just puzzle out how to get ahold of the boss' fur somewhere,  climb on his back and stab him a bunch of times... do this sixteen times and the game is over (thankfully). I cannot in good conscience recommend that anybody purchase this half-assed collection, but if you must have it I would wait a bit since it is bad enough that it should plummet in price quickly like Brink and Duke Nukem did."

3761596,B00CCOBOI4,Interesting product,"I gave this to my boyfriend how works on cars.  He liked the idea and has tried it out on the side windows of a vehicle, he hasn't gotten to the step where you remove the strip because you are supposed to leave it on there for protection.  It looks nice and will protect against rain, salt and bad winters here.  He especially liked the spray nozzle that came with this kit, it also fits any can not just the ones that come with this kit, so that is an added bonus."
1796829,B005DKJIVE,Heart measurement isn't very reliable,"I've tested this with three different people and in each case we couldn't depend on the reported heart rate, which would vary enormously for no apparent reason. There's advice in the manual about how best to obtain an accurate heart rate but it's simply not as accurate as the basic heart monitors found on most exercise equipment. It's also annoying that it doesn't work unless you're standing still whereas most of these sensors on treadmills will work while still running or moving around. The watch itself is comfortable and the stopwatch features are fine. But the major reason for buying this digital watch is for the heart rate function which simply isn't good enough to warrant buying this device."
1892640,0767802624,Will Smith saves the planet again ... this time in a good film!,"After the horribly cheesy ""Independence Day"" of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where ""Mikey"", an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) and Will Smith (Agent J) are perfect in their roles. Not since Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan were partners on ""Law and Order"" has the young cop/old cop routine been done so well with such great chemistry and deadpan humor.All of the supporting roles work too. Rip Torn is great as Zed, the head of the secret government organization - the ""Men In Black"" - who are in charge of overseeing the visits of extraterrestrials who have chosen to establish contact with earth and in some cases become semi-permanent residents of this planet. His great one-liners include telling a group of rejected job applicants - who really don't know what kind of job they've applied for - ""Congratulations gentlemen. You are all we've come to expect from years of government training"". Some of the rank and file employees of the agency are aliens themselves. Unmotivated and not particularly loyal, they enjoy hanging out in the break room drinking coffee, smoking heavily, and collecting cheap miniatures of the Statue of Liberty. Vincent D'Onofrio is also outstanding in the dual role of Edgar, a human who gets eaten by a malicious alien cockroach, and also as the cockroach himself as he tools around New York City in his ""brand new Edgar suit"" - Edgar's skin - in an attempt to appear human while trying to start an intergalactic war.Any human who happens to encounter an alien won't remember it thanks to the neuralizer - a device the size of a fountain pen - that the ""Men In Black"" administer to erase any resulting memories. This includes employees of the agency themselves, should they choose to quit or retire. The underlying purpose of all of this covering up makes sense when Smith's character, during his orientation session, tells Tommy Lee Jones that he thinks that people could handle the truth about aliens living among them. Jones' (Agent K's) response is: ""A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it."" This is hard to argue with when you think about the acts that people throughout history have performed as a mob that they would never have done as individuals.I really enjoyed this film, and its smart humor has held up over the years. I think in the future many will wonder, as I still do, why this film didn't get a nod at the Academy Awards other than its award for best makeup, at the very least for the screenplay."
1121493,B00COVCV50,fun and relaxing,"This is a great app to keep for those times when you're waiting, as it can be put down at a moment's notice. But you won't be able to stop thinking about it! It has a nice mixture of simple to solve pics and more difficult ones. So it's not too difficult to play with school age kids, yet not so simple as to be boring for teens & adults. I bet it would help older folks to keep their minds sharp. You are shown 4pictures and must figure out a word to describe them all using the letters provided. It has a shuffle feature to mix the letters up if you need to get a fresh perspective, a must have feature, IMO. It is a bit easier than I'd like but I play with my daughter so it's perfect for playing together. Have fun!"
117095,B0094G44PS,Good for the price,"minus 1 star because of a couple things. I have a entertainment center with Ipod/Iphone docking. The pairing was smooth. It sounds great. It works fine with my laptop and Iphone. When i disconnect the Bluetooth from laptop/Iphone, the adapter goes into discovery mode if i don't turn off the entertainment center. I use my entertainment for watching TV and movies (DVD). It's kind of annoying to see the blue/red light flashing and other people would be able to connect to it, if they're in range. The adapter should have a button for pairing so that it doesn't go into discover mode every time it's turned on, plugged in or disconnected. One other thing, i have to remove and re-plug the adapter every time i turn on my entertainment system. I guess the docking has continuous power even the entertain system is off, for charging purposes. So the adapter doesn't reset.For the price ($16), i'm  happy with it. It's nice to have an option if i decide to go with other smart phones (android/windows)."
192507,B00JBJ3HTW,Nice piece of tech,"When I was young the digital watch was high tech.  I spent a lot of money on watches back then.Now days there is a clock on everything so the necessity of a personal timepiece has diminished for me.  I was something special back then when I purchased a Pulsar watch with a built in calculator.  It was gold with lots of tiny buttons on the face.It has been years since I even thought about that old watch.I guess this might be an excellent example of a quantum leap.Anyway ... about the watch / Gear 2:Thinner, lighter, and more comfortable than I expected.  I have worn it for several days with only one person noticing it on my wrist.  I am happy about that.I love my tech gadgets but don't want them to make me look like Mr. Bling Bling if you know what I mean.This tech is awesome.  I am still learning about the versatile applications while I enjoy the apps that I do understand.Best characteristics are:Quick acknowledgement of new incoming messages, texts, or phone calls.No need to pull my phone from the holster or pocket.One short alert beep and I take a quick peek to discern the priority.  I can choose to read the full message or just keep going about my business.The speed of the operating system is better than expected.  The display is bright and clear.Being able to choose from a host of Samsung watch face styles is a treat.I actually enabled the ir remote tv app and to my surprise I use it and I like it.Before I received it I thought I might suffer from buyers remorse and figured I might likely send it back following a quick look-see.  The novelty of the concept could fade with time but so far it feels natural.  I'm feeling like it is a part of me.  My migration to the concept was a fluid one."
1141846,B00D4EBQ3E,would be fun if you could get help,"This game is ridiculous.

1655119,B005XVZKGA,Awful Taste,"I was only given one bottle from the  Vine program to try out. This is not enough to see if the caffeine works so I cannot comment on that. But as others have pointed out, the aftertaste is bitter. I regularly drink filtered water as we have a built-in home filter. I sometimes drink bottled water on the go if offered. This water did not have a pleasant taste, and I could not finish the bottle in one sitting.The bottle itself is an odd shape, difficult to be transported since the bottom flares out so much.  They definitely need to redesign this bottle for portability.Not recommended at all."
1879038,B001T46U32,Continuing the pleasures of the previous album,"Veteran Scottish band Camera Obscura issued its best album with its 2006 release ""Let's Get Out Of This Country"" and then after a lot of touring and the inevitable and necessary time off fter that, the band now finally comes back with its new album.""My Maudlin Career"" (11 tracks; 46 min.) starts off with the immediately catchy ""French Navy"" and it becomes immediately clear that, despite having changed record labels since its previous album, the band is continuing on the musical groove of its previous album. The songs roll along gently, and I never tire of lead singer's Tracyanne Caombells' voice. It's hard to pinpoint highlights as such as the album presents itself as one cohesive unit (in other words: a true album), but my personal favorite tracks (besides the already mentioned ""French Nacy"") include ""Away With Murder"", the gentle but irresitble ""Swans"", the ballad ""Careless Love"", and the hauntingly beautiful ""Other Towns & Cities"".In all, ""My Maudlin Career"" is a fine album, but for me just a tad too closely in musical texture to the band's previous album. Finally, if you wonder where you can here these guys, check out internet-only WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), which brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none."
1634547,B004FI97RU,I love unsweetened coconut milk,"I don't know how I went so long without trying alternatives to cow milk. Duh.I kept using cow milk because I thought it was lower in carbs. I assumed wrongly.Coconut milk is very low cal and very low carb (unsweetened). After a few cups of millky chai, I am totaly adapted to unsweetened coconut milk, which is very good for my diabetes glucose levels. Yea for me.This product is not organic and not cheap. They sell a virtually identical product at Trader Joe's for two bucks a quart and sell half gallons refrigerated for three bucks so I won't be ordering again. This stuff is good but not organic and now nearly the lowest price.  I only ordered on amazon cause I didn't know about coconut milk in stores. Cheaper is where I go."
1806275,B007V5AUEI,A Very Bright Light,"I like this light.  It is very bright and I love the cool white color it puts out.  What really sold me on it were the youtube videos of people dropping this light, running it over with a truck, and throwing it down concrete stairs.  I work in construction and have dropped and broken many halogen lights.  I've also burned myself on a halogen light or two which makes this LED light all the more appealing.  The downsides?  This light is expensive.  Also the battery doesn't last very long ... an hour at the longest on high (which is what they advertise).  I store this light in my truck and I have noticed that the battery life is significantly decreased when it is cold outside.  I expect this out of all my lithium-ion batteries, but on a 15 degree day, this light might last 20-30 minutes on a full charge.  I usually end up having to plug it in, which really isn't a terrible inconvenience considering a comparable halogen would have to be plugged in anyway.  I do not have any Festool batteries to attach to this light,  I'm sure that would extend the life considerably.  Overall I'm pleased with it.  Festool continues to make the highest quality tools around and even after a year of bouncing around in my truck it is still in pristine condition.  I'm considering buying a second one and putting both lights on a tripod.  It would be sweet if Festool offered a package that way, maybe with a systainer to put them in."

1303409,B007PKR3SK,Didn't work for me.,"I bought this brand because I have one of their mic stand mounts (for iPhone) which I like a lot.Pros:The clips did a good job holding my iPad Mini without having to remove the folio type cover (Marware Axis).Quality seems acceptable for the price, the ball swivel works well.Cons:It's too heavy for my mic stands.  I tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable.  If the boom is positioned in a very upright position it's ok, but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose!The clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome.I had high hopes for this one but it's not going to work for me.  I have returned it and ordered a different ChargerCity model, the one with the lever-type mount."

SDS is a style of bit that has indentations on the end and clicks into the chuck. This will not accommodate regular style bits. Generally SDS style caterer to masonary, chisels, hammer. Their are not alot of regular wood, metal, bits for SDS .  I used mine to bore holes in a solid concrete floor and this unit bored in as though it were butter. I have a Dewalt hammer drill and it made little headway on the same concrete floor. I chiseled tile off of bathroom walls for hours with no sign of over heating or reduction in strength. It comes in a nice heavy plastic case with room for bits. The chuck head is grease packed (which is normal) and you will experience some ooze."

1300320,B001J1JRN0,Wonderful amp. Too bad it has been dropped from Fender's line!,"Small. Light weight. Stunning Fender Blackface looks. Warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive. The digital voicing is direct and easy to set up. The fact that Fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me. It is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio. The direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder/mixer and still give you the amp's skeaker as a monitor for yourself. What could be easier? And it mikes well too, by the way. The choice is yours there.With no LED display (cost increase if one was there) and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive, it's so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun, and practicle too. The voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates. The Tweed, Blackface, and Marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp.Love the reverb in the FX section. The spring reverb is so well done that I bumped the amp once and was looking for the ""spring chrash"" known from amps with the real spring reverb. It's that good. Once again, the controls are easy and direct. Never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort. Who cares if it doen't have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection? You want that, go waste your money on a Line 6 or something. This Champ is made for one thing. To give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort. I believe it has accomplished that well.Again, a shame that Fender has dropped this model from the line up of products. The super model is a step up in power and speaker size, but also the cost is higher as well. I'm just glad that I got one of these from Amazon. com when I did and will not part with the amp. Been playing for five decades now and I know when I have a good instrument or gear and when I don't. This model is a keeper to be sure. And I don't even like digital! How's that for an endorsement? It's that good for what it does...."

1717146,B0009IQZPW,Very useful for detailing,"I use these pads for two things: Applying wax/sealant to my car's finish and for applying conditioner to my vinyl convertible top.I have an orbital buffer that I use to polish my car, however when I'm just looking to apply a wax or sealant, these do a great job.  They are very soft, so assuming the car's finish is clean, they won't do any damage to it.  One important note is that these WONT work well at all for polishing.  You want a firmer, more abrasive pad for that (either very firm foam, or cotton).On the convertible top these are superior to the cotton and microfiber pads because they absolutely will not leave any lint.  Due to the abrasive texture of most convertible tops, microfiber cloths shed terribly when applying protectant.  These foam pads do not."

The strips are quite salty with a little bit of spice.  At first they are crispy, but they become soft when chewed.

1670495,B0094KD9OQ,Just add water! (and flavor),"My wife, son, and I all agree that this cereal just tastes entirely too plain.  My son probably put it best: It tastes a lot like plain oatmeal if all you add is water.  Despite the occasional cranberry pieces, this is just an unexceptional cereal.Since we still have several cups of it left, we will be supplementing the taste with some chopped up fresh fruit.  But once it's gone, we are unlikely to get it again.  After all, the idea with these prepackaged cereals is their convenience...but that convenience disappears as soon as I start chopping up fruit.Another complaint: the recommended amount of water (there is a fill line on the side of the cup) makes the cereal way too soupy.  I recommend cutting back on the water quite a bit.Finally: be careful if you make this in the microwave.  It reached a boil and spilled all over in the microwave way before the expected time (based on following directions).  I don't blame the product for this...microwaves vary and you should always be cautious about the time it takes to cook with them.All in all, I can't really recommend these unless you want to take the time to add something with a little more flavor."

His lyrics are almost elementary in this album, while the production isn't even that inspiring ( with the exception of JB's Breathe ). What happened to the hungry kid from BK that was keepin' it gangsta on "" Ghetto Fabolous "" ? Beats me, but thats the Fabolous I want to hear from. So here we are with the second consecutive Fabolous album with 1 decent track. ( sigh ) Fab isn't displaying his talent. It seems that in his attempt to please multiple genres, he also dilutes what made him cooked crack on "" Ghetto Fabolous "".

3719624,B006ERHX0I,Far from invincible,My yorkie ripped this dog up the first day. I don't know if it was the squeeker that drove her crazy but she was able to get the squeeker out by ripping the seams. I filled it with regular stuffing and sewed it back up and so far it is holding up.
3744644,B0009IK5NU,Meh,It was quiet and smooth for about 2 months in rainy Seattle. It's not particularly great. It's squeaking now. The plastic &#34;booty&#34; that covers the arms I guess supposed to work to prevent snow from clogging the wiper but did it help? Meh....hard to say. The ends of the wipers have some RED plastic caps on them and it's very distracting to see something RED swooshing in front of my face in the rain. Why couldn't they use black caps?I'm going to look for a triple bladed wiper blade which worked better.

1848349,B00000DCHG,This album makes you pray for him to go back to his 70's style,"I've owned this cd, but didn't keep it for very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. I guess when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70's style, and on this offering, he kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. This stuff is just to slick for this hombre. He never made a solid album, after the release of GLASS HOUSES, in about 1980. This is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about, but if you've got some integrity, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one, and buy anything he recorded in the 70's."

4218,B000WKQ8LS,Useful for iPhone 5 external battery case owners,"An adapter like this is a must-have if you own an iPhone 5 external battery case.  These cases extend about a half inch below the bottom of the iPhone, which creates problems for connecting headsets.With the Apple earbuds, the headset's connector and too-short strain relief disappear almost completely within the bottom of the battery case, so that when you want to remove the headset you have to pull on the skinny cord.  Almost a sure bet the headset cord will fail if you use your headset a lot.With aftermarket headsets, the diameter or shape of the headset connector may prevent you from fully inserting the connector.This adapter is very flexible so it's not like you have a rigid wire sticking out of the bottom of your iPhone.  i wish the connector body was longer so I didn't have to grasp the skinny cord to pull the adapter out of the phone.  But it's better to have this inexpensive adapter fail than to damage the $30 earbuds.Some battery case manufacturers are beginning to include an adapter like this free of charge because they have realized the design dilemna associated with Apple's decision to move the headset jack to the bottom of the phone."

1191142,B00ENTF0G8,UPDATED REVIEW: Tap response somewhat working,"The tap response seems to be working - somewhat. I can get past the opening, and, in fact, purchased the game.  Not one of the wisest things I have done!It takes multiple taps to get items to register. The mini-games are annoyingly repetitive.  The story line could have been good, if the cartoon-like images were changed.I actually played it to the end, even though the Pharoah puzzle is not correct.  I just kept switching the circles in a systemic way until I got it.  Also, there is a circle shield in the last area before that puzzle that needs to be picked up, but is right by the ""go back"" button, and so, I had to repeat that stupid maze-like area quite a few times before I actually could get it.This is a game that was uninstalled right after I finished it.  Usually I play a good game a few times.  This is not one.  I play on the KF 1st gen."

1716738,B0009CEKY6,"Poor, Cheap Design - Pur Faucet Filter - 3400B","This is the worst design I've ever seen for a faucet water filter. My previous Pur filter got a crack in the side after just a few months of use. Since I still have unused Pur filters, I bought this one hoping it would be better. Looks like it's going to have the same problem - instead of channeling the water from the faucet into the filter, the water fills up the cheap plastic housing that holds the filter and it makes its way into the filter through pressure. I'm returning it and probably switching to another brand even though I've got the extra Pur filters.I almost forgot - the ""one click"" feature also doesn't work very well eitherl. It's a flimsy plastic button/grip onto a rubberish piece that screws onto your faucet. Too much water pressure and it ""one-clicks"" right off! I just got my new Brita filter - MUCH better."
1600437,B001YJBLMM,inedible,They look pretty but neither I nor my husband could eat more than half a cracker. Terrible GF after-taste. I put them out for the squirrels and they wouldn't touch them either!(it's January in Mich.) Over the holidays I found Glutino crackers and also tossed out the Blue Diamond in the cupboard (the squirrels DID at least eat those). My favorite for spread and cheeses is the Glutino Cheese which has just hint of cheese flavor.

Great for singing, micing amps and such. These are 39.99 each at a local music store so....Update: These are perfect for micing amps or for use as a drummer's mic, but if you grab it with some enthusiasm, the plastic part the mic attaches too will separate and the whole thing will come off in your hand. I used clear epoxy on both and have yet to have any more trouble like that. I still say they are good for the price, just need a dab of glue to ensure no incidents happen."
3169740,B002Q5O6ZM,American History,This is a great series that we just started watching. I would recommend watching this if you like history or if you are curious about that time in America.

1607029,B002GWFA64,It smelled nice....,"Firstly, I prefer my beans roasted slightly darker, this is very much a blonde roast.  But I could possibly re-roast these beans, however:My favorite coffee of all time was something sold by Starbucks called Komodo Dragon, and other coffees like it by Starbucks.  It is missing a bitterness I associate with acid in coffee, a bite that, in its absense, allows you to taste the coffee. The lack of that distracting bitterness leaves the coffee with overtones of chocolate and berries and, well, all of the good flavors of coffee.  I would drink the coffee hot, but more often cool, unsweetened, unflavored, since I found I could taste it much better when it was cool.A few years ago, Starbucks changed their coffee from ""Komodo Dragon"" to ""Komodo Dragon Blend"".  It was still very close in flavor to the original coffee, which I think was all from a limited area.But now it no longer has a good flavor.  It has that bitterness that used to be missing from most Indonesian Coffees and specifically Komodo Dragon and Blend.So I went off to try and find another decent coffee, something low acid, not bitter, and able to feed my five pound a month habit.This coffee was labeled as a ""very low acid coffee"". I had hope for it. I bought the smallest quantity I could see available, which was a five pound bag.This is not the coffee that will replace Komodo Dragon - it is not even close.  It is bitter, has the flavor of a central american washed coffee.  If that is a flavor you like, you might like this coffee.  Me?  I'm not going to buy another bag, and I will probably make 2-3 pots to see if I can stand drinking it at all-I am very close to declaring it undrinkable and returning it..I want to make sure that I am only tasting this coffee - I cleaned the grinder and all that but I will make at least one more pot to be sure I don't have any of the fail Komodo Dragon Blend in the pathway.  If that comes out as bad as this pot I will likely return it - or give it to a neighbor or some such.  Or drink it with some hazelnut syrup or even cardamom to mask the bitterness.  Because it is not that low acid, unbitter coffee that Komodo Dragon Blend used to be.And that is too bad."

The filters do nothing and the pump gets clogged up and makes this infuriating sucky grinding noise.  I prefer the Drinkwell.  It's easier to fill although I always hurt my hands on the plastic edges when I clean it.  Still searching for the perfect fountain because my cats, and dogs do love their running water."

1839190,B000002MST,Another Of The Terrific Gordon Lightfoot Abums of the 70s!,"This is one of Lightfoot's best and most popular albums, produced when he  was at the height of his incredible popularity in the mid 1970s. For a  while Lightfoot, like his fellow troubadours James Taylor, John Denver, and  Van Morrison, could seemingly do nothing wrong.  In fact, over a fifteen  period, Gordon Lightfoot produced so many superior albums populated by such  uniformly outstanding songs that we've become inured to the fact that he is  such a singular, talented and singular talent. Every single song on this  album is extremely well written, sung and arranged, from the opening  &quot;Bend In The Water"" to the very popular hit ""Rainy Day People"", which  saw a lot of air-time, as did the title song, ""Cold On The Shoulder"". Yet  this isn't just an album put out with filler surrounding a couple of hit  songs. None of Lightfoot's albums is anything but an eclectic but lovely  collection of very memorable and quite accomplished songs. My personal  favorites here are ""Rainbow Trout"", ""A Tree Too Weak To Stand', and ""All  The Lovely Ladies"". I also like ""As Fine As Fine Can Be"" and have to admit  there isn't a single pooch in the passel of songs offered here, and all  written by Lightfoot himself. The truth of the matter is that Gordon  Lightfoot is an incredibly talented singer/songwriter who has already left  us a dozen or so terrific albums for our continuing entertainment and  edification. This is certainly one of the best of them. Enjoy"

4714,B0013G8PTS,Great product.  I was pleasantly surprised,"I took this charger to CES 2013.  As anyone who's been to CES knows, a single charge on a phone doesn't last the whole day.  I bought this product right before I left to use with my iPhone 5 (also a recent purchase).  My first impression taking it out of the box was how small and light it was.  I was expecting something bulky and heavy.  My next impression was how nice it looked.  Now I never heard of NewTrent before this and bought this simply because of the price and Amazon reviews so my expectations weren't high.  I charged it up the night before and towards the afternoon my iPhone was getting low and I plugged it in.  Worked like a charm.  Walking around about an hour let it charge up enough that I was satisfied.  I met up with a friend who also was running low from his phone and I charged his too.  This repeated the next 3 days.My friends are now going to buy this for themselves.Pros:1.  Small, light, portable and beautiful industrial design2.  4 blue LED lights make it easy to understand what's happening3.  Quick charging.4.  USB plug enables charging of any device5.  Laser pointer and LED light are a nice touchCons:1.  Button is too easy to press.  Occasionally I look in the pouch and the Laser pointer is on by accident.2.  The instruction manual is very awkward.  I couldn't understand how to turn the LED light on.  I also didn't like the labeling of the included cables.  Makes you think you can only use them with the Android devices.3.  Needs something rubber on it to grip.

1329066,B00005TQ0X,So close to being the best!,"Boy, what an appropriately named adventure game! The title ""Schizm"", a bastardization of the word schism (Myst - mist, Schizm - schism, get it?), was probably meant to reflect the main twist of the game. The ""division or separation"" is realized by the ability to play the game through the eyes of either of the two main characters (one male and one female, of course) that have been separated not only by location but also by (surprise) parallel phases. Your job is, of course, to try and reunite them into the same phase while also trying to find the original inhabitants of the world in yet another alternate phase or some such.On the surface, this is a pretty neat little twist to the typical first person adventure genre and, for the most part, it succeeds in setting itself apart from the rest of the pack. But, I think there is another schism lurking beneath the surface: a small one between this game's reality and its true potential of being the all-time best adventure game.It came so very close to fulfilling that potential (at least the DVD version almost did). The drop-dead gorgeous 3D graphics, alone, vault this game into the upper echelons of the genre. To date, I think only Exile rivals this game in sheer beauty. Add to that a lush music score, some truly great puzzles to solve and some killer cut-scenes (although, the ""Living Ship"", once you get it to move, looks too Monty Python-ish to me!), you are just a breath away from being on the top rung.Then, there is the character acting. So many times these game designers have poured so many resources into their graphics, music and game design only to be tripped up by the amateurish actors they get to portray their characters! Timelapse is the classic example and, unfortunately, Schizm is much worse. Every time one of these characters popped onto the screen to try and tell me something about their plight, I just cringed. It got to the point where I didn't really care about them and had no incentive to try and save them. Even the occasional observations by the two main characters made me wish that they would just shut up.My last small gripe belongs to the conveyance cut-scenes. Most of the time, the animations traversed you only about a quarter of the way to your destination and then ""faded"" to the final quarter of the trip, leaving out about half of the journey. Maybe the designers had to do this for space considerations, but it drove me absolutely nuts! I SO wanted to experience the entire journeys at least once (the skyride from balloon to balloon being a perfect example). Then, on subsequent journeys from place to place (and you do have to do that A LOT), it would have made sense to allow you to skip the full animations with the spacebar or escape key.My dream is that they will release an ""extended"" version of this game with the full cut-scenes and better actors. Then it truly would be the best of the best. A sequel is in the works to be released later this year (Mysterious Journey II: Chameleon). I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will be THE ONE!"
1798332,B005IRLO1E,"UPDATED Jan 2: Easy install, excellent customer service, lights work","UPDATE JAN 2:  The Amazon Vine program sent a replacement kit and as hubby dearest suggested the transmitter was not working correctly in the first kit that arrived. After installing the new transmitter the system works perfectly. The lights are clear and bright. Hopefully, they will work during an emergency, and I bet they will, based on the significant light output shown during today's test.I am not sure how the Vine program works with its vendors, but it seems the Mr. Beams company officials at a guess, were willing to send a replacement for Vine program reviewers, if there was a problem. This speaks well of the Mr. Beams company, and as usual Amazon, who always stands by their customers. Also, a Mr. Beams company representative responded to my earlier comments about the lack of documentation when installing two zones using the Mr. Beams ReadyBright Wireless Power Outage kit. The company representative, whose name I have forgotten (I'm sorry) responded quickly and said his company would review the documentation and take needed steps, if required, to update the installation instructions. This speaks well of the Mr. Beams company as the company seems interested in providing good customer service.My husband who installed the kit said:This kit seems to have the capability of operating in two selectable zones controlled by dip switches on the controller and lights.  I found this out in trying to figure out why the first kid did not work.  The documentation on the lights do not mention these switches or there use and the controller documentation only mentions them briefly without any detail in their proper use.  They come preset to the correct positions for normal operation (at least all of the ones I received were and this was not the cause of the first kit's malfunction). In lieu of proper operating instructions I recommend leaving these switches in the as received state.Recommend.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Also, once installed the system refused to function. The flashlight worked but the other lights did not operate. My husband suspects it is a problem with the transmitter. It is an educated guess by my husband who is an engineer.Amazon has shipped a replacement system and I will update this review once we attempt to install the second system.Note:  One of the company representatives responded to this review. He said the company would review their documentation."

72641,B006SK5FYM,Greatly improved battery life,"Bought this battery for my girlfriend a few weeks ago and she loves it. Where she lives and works she had poor reception which caused her phone to signal search and thus suck the battey dead in the matter of 6 - 8 hours. With the original battery she had to charge the phone every night and it would often still die before bed time. Now her batter easily lasts all day, and if she forgets to charge it one night it will usually last until the next night. The battery does make the phone fatter, and doesnt work with most phone covers, which is the only down side. The phone still fits in your pocket, but it is much less comfortable than before. Highly recommend this battery to anyone who want longer life, and if you do not carry your phone in your pocket this is a perfect product."

Using a Lacrosee BC-700 battery charger's charge/test function, each battery was rated as follows:Battery 1 = 868 mAhBattery 1 = 875 mAhBattery 1 = 892 mAhBattery 1 = 878 mAhConsistent with its rating of 850 mAh.Recyko is the low self discharge nickel metal hydride battery manufactured by GP (Gold Peak - a Hong Kong based company).  I find them comparable to other low-discharge batteries from Sanyo, Rayovac, Duracell, Yuasa, etc.  Package says 850 mAh, 1.2V.  Printed on the battery itself says 820mAh.  These batteries does not look as sleek and sexy as the Eneloops; they are wrapped in thin metallic plastic, but for sure pack a lot of juice for the money. Made in China."
1303310,B0073XCXHA,The Best Tuner,"For the money there isn't a better tuner on the market today.  This is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker, really?  This tuner is s[pot on every time and super fast.  You can move from string to string quick."
1297424,B0006NDF8A,Dangerous for loved guitars,"I'm another reviewer who has, upon personal inspection, discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar.

526642,B00G7PCF0U,No Love for Dove,"In recent months, Dove -- the soap our grannies loved -- has inexplicably launched a line of personal care products for men.This Dove for Men antiperspirant claims to be a non-irritant, but apparently the manufacturer was not referring to the smell of this ""Fresh Awake"" variety, a sort of pungent pineapple scent.Why would a guy want to smell like a pineapple, you ask?  Is there some sort of ""metrosexual"" subtext here that I, as a man in my sixth decade, can't hope to comprehend?Perhaps.  And I hope I don't flatter myself too much if I suppose that my natural b.o. might be a scent more pleasant to some than pungent pineapple.I should also confess that I myself am a devotee of gel antiperspirants.  They're kind to the environment compared to aerosol antis, they apply quickly and comfortably, and they don't leave stains on your clothes.I'm pleased to report that this Dove bar didn't leave a stain on my flannel shirt, but it was rather hard to apply -- rather like rubbing your armpit with a rounded wedge of parmesan cheese.  Another form of irritation, by my reckoning.Finally I must mention the container.  At first glance, this would appear to be a large size of the product.  A closer look reveals the container holds just 2.7 ounces of the product -- the entire three-quarter inch base is actually a handle you twist to raise the antiperspirant bar for application.This little portion doesn't come cheap -- north of five bucks at the currently listed price.  I can get 3 ounces of Old Spice gel, which works as well, smells better, and goes on faster and easier, for just under three bucks.To be fair, this Dove is supposed to last for 48 hours, but is that only if you don't shower?  I can't imagine neglecting to shower once a day, and I can't imagine failing to apply antiperspirant after I shower.So if you suffer from anti-perspiration irritation -- and you don't mind smelling like pineapple upside-down cake -- you might want to try this ""Fresh Awake"" version of Dove for Men.  I would suggest that there are better, cheaper alternatives available.PROS:* Touted to cause no irritation (unless you find the scent unpleasant, as I did).* Claimed to last for 48 hours (unclear if it continues to work after you shower).CONS:* Pungent pineapple scent.* Not as easy to apply as gel antiperspirant.* Expensive."
2563635,B00005R23S,Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful - So Much Passion!,"How did I get here.  I heard this guy's music here and there for years and really didn't pay attention.  I was more of a jazz fan - Miles Davis was the man.  I'm a big fan of author Nick Hornby and he mentions a lot of artists in his books that I love.  I kept seeing Springsteen come up.  I had also read about that little informal competition between Springsteen and The Clash so that also got me interested.  As a musician I love listening to live performances so I came to Amazon and saw all the great reviews for the Live in New York City CD set.  I bought that, then went on a Springsteen binge (somebody save me!) and decided I had to see these performances as I kept reading how great they are visually.  I'm glad I purchased this!  These guys have so much love for one another and the audience, they really do bring it full on.  The performances on the DVD are in some cases different than those on the CD which is great.  Love it and highly recommend it.  Now I gotta by London Calling Live From Hyde Park."
1516658,B009LWQ8FE,OMG what happened to all the sneaking??,"I am quite shocked that they even called this metal gear.First, where is the old man with the moustache from the last game?Second, where did this terminator robot come from, and with a sword?? Come on!I don't see any assassinating, crawling, spy v spy stealth action at all. It is Ninja Gaiden but they changed it to ""Raiden""Seems like a rip-off ninja gaiden. omg omg....if you disagree, well..... just my honest opinion. they should call this ninja raiden or ninja gaiden 4, not metal gear!(for the limited edition:)I opened it and it comes with some soundtrack, well nothing special, bunch of modern techno synthesised music. It has this metal case thing that gets scratched so easily right out of the box, so its kinda redundant. I don't see any use of having a metal case with even less details and descriptions about the game than the original case. And then there's this light-up beanpole thing that isn't exactly modern art.(for the ps3 version:)at least the ps3 black bar on top of the box does go well with the rest of the box design."
1790017,B004HY3APW,Great for the household uses.,I had one of these for many years and finally wore it  out.  When I saw they are still being made I ordered a replacement immediately.  It comes in handy of so many little jobs around the house I keep it in a kitchen drawer.

FYI:  If you have an &#34;add ins&#34; setting on your bread machine, adding diced ham and shredded cheese makes this bread even better!"
1302914,B005FKF1PY,Amazing tuner,This little tuner is excellent. Very accurate. I love it. I have other tuners but this one is the best. I didn't realize it was so small.

The balance of them were donated to the local dog shelter, lesson learned."

253716,B000H7O5M0,Very good outliner,I have owned this trimmer for about a year before i sold them to a friend and they worked great. I would only use these for outlining and egding not for a clipper. Only reason I sold to upgrade to andis T outliner but these are a little cheaper and they work just fine. Update after some went by with the Andis T outliner I have concluded that I rather have the 5 star detailer over the andis outliner. the wahl makes sharper lines and it doesnt get hot like the andis not saying that the andis isnt a good product the wahl just seems better both are fine but recommend the Wahl 5 star.

1632728,B004E4CCSQ,Great flavor enhancer for your water!,"I struggle to drink enough water, so I'm always looking for ways to make it taste better. Those powder drink packets are great, but what if your cup is larger or smaller than the recommended size? You can try to adjust amounts, but it's hard to guess just right.Enter MiO. It's a liquid, and you can squirt as little or as much as you want into your water. It diffuses through the water rapidly (no shaking, stirring, or globs of undissolved powder). It may take one or two tries to get the right amount of flavoring for your water, but after that, it becomes pretty easy to eyeball it.The taste is similar to Crystal Light's Peach Tea. I've tried a couple other MiO flavors, too, but Peach Tea is definitely my favorite. It has become my go-to water enhancer--I go through one bottle a month at work.MiO is a great product that I highly recommend!"
3468732,B0090XUARQ,People,Not as good as #1 but still very good and it keep my interest but not like the first one. The story line was just a little off for me from the start of this series.
1445553,B002I0JIQW,good value,"Portal 2 is both a sequel and a prequel.At the beginning, I was afraid the female ""Glados"" was discontinued, replaced by an uninteresting male glados and an another, annoying (but often funny), male british voice (""Wheatley"")...fortunately, the female glados makes an encore appearance throughout the middle of the game.In the earlier-middle parts of the game, I was annoyed by several verbal references to the game being almost near the end. Why try to bum the player out? STFU and let me play the game to the end...if the game is any good, I'll know when it's almost over without any anyone telling me.The graphics in P2 are much more elaborate and the backgrounds are infinitely deeper/more grand than the original, but the beginning of this sequel is weak.  It takes quite a while to get some thought provoking puzzles going...and then it's totally on.Most of the puzzles are brilliant.  Many of them had me thinking I would never be able to solve them...but I always did.  One of my obstacles was ""easter egg"" rooms I thought might be part of the puzzle...they aren't. Valve also includes a bunch of new techniques (light paths, light tunnels, gels, etc) that can make you forget you can use the portals, just by themselves, on the walls and floors.  Don't be distracted by secret rooms, cracked glass and the new stuff...it's all about the portals.Didn't particularly like the ending, as I like to take my time figuring out the puzzles.  I also could have done without parts of P2 that just have you running around a bunch of stairs listening to a bunch of useless dialogue (and not that funny) - they have little to do with the story and nothing to do with puzzles.Bottom line: Don't give up!!! (you will hate yourself if you look up a walk-through)."
1297546,B0007ORM0K,stays in tune,I placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer. Stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock Ping tuners. This is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed. To those who say it doesnt stay in tune should have their guitar's bridge checked as flaws in the bridge can cause problems in tuning.

191145,B00INGFBM0,Crap. Sorry I even wasted my time and money.,"Crap. I have installed numerous versions of this type of screen protector over the years and have never had a problem. This is the first time I have tried a product from Spigen, though. Mistake. I quickly burned through all three protectors, as they either never cured correctly or had bubbles even days after the application. I spoke with customer service who was actually very nice, but asked that I send back the now discarded protectors. Though I no longer had them, they made an &#34;exception&#34; and said they will do me a favor and send a replacement.So the replacement comes and instead of it being a box of three, like the original purchase had, it was one single protector which of course is once again in the garbage as this one also did not cure correctly. The least they could have done was send me an exact replacement of three. I didn't know that this big &#34;exception&#34; that was made would be for a single protector that probably cost three cents to make. I officially give up on Spigen. This is the first negative review I have ever written on Amazon. I just don't want others to have to waste their time and money like I did."

It gave my car interior a nice ""showroom"" shine but not overly so.  It left the interior glossy and new looking but I would not describe it as greasy or shiny in a distracting way.  Very good product.  I recommend spraying directly onto a towel first so not to get it everywhere in your vehicle."

386471,B0037KMI0U,Cleans well - hate the smell,"Tide does a fantastic job of getting clothes clean. We have used it for years and never had a complaint. Fabreze makes an odor  remover that lacks a scent and we use that along with Tide and together they make a great pair. This product, however, is too much of a good thing. My wife washed her garden jacket in this product as a test since the coat absorbs various scents as she works in the yard. Yesterday, when she got in the car, I almost gagged - &#34;What's that smell?&#34; I exclaimed. She said it was the Fabreze perfume from the Tide. Yeach! Too strong for me and her both. We had to ride with the window open!!Not sure if this is just us, but we'll be giving the bottle of this stuff away or will be using it to wash things we're giving away to charity - definitely not for us.Not recommended."

My heel is something that I will need to get a cortisone shot for in the future but that gives me side effects that are not healthy (like temporary hypertension) so it is nice to have something to help in the mean time.  Also, this product has no odor and is not a menthol containing cream.  It contains a generous 2.5 oz. of whitish cream in a metal tube.The active ingredient is Arnica montana 1X HPUS-7%. (&#34;the letters HPUS indicate that this ingredient is officially included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States.&#34;)  Additional ingredients (inactive) include: alcohol, caprylyl glycol, carbomer, cetyl palmitate, EDTA disodium, glycerin, lauroyl macrogoglycerides, pegoxol-7 stearate, purified water, sodium hydroxide, sorbic acid, 1,2-hexanediol.Directions are &#34;Apply a thin layer of Arnicare Cream to affected area and massage gently as soon possible after minor injury. Repeat 3 times a day or as needed. Included under The Warnings is  &#34;For external use only, avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, damaged skin or wounds, When using this product...do not bandage tightly or use a heating pad. Stop use and ask a doctor if condition persists for more than 3 days or worsens.&#34;  Also under the warnings is to keep out of reach of children and if swallowed to get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away."

Well, I'll take that back, Inertiatic ESP is actually quite a great song, punchy, dynamic, even catchy, well as long as the stupid jackass singing the lyrics keeps his voice unintelligible.  I mean &quot;mincemeat of pupils&quot; lets get real, thats garbage, so just scream little man, scream.  It's not that these guys aren't talented, they are, almost mind-blowingly.  But I don't care, the musical world is full of technicial talents who can't write a song for their life, and these guys might join them if they don't taper down the theatrics, or at least make them compelling.  This CD just sounds like a bunch of guys sitting in a room blowing their instruments out and jamming for hours, and leaving Rick Rubin to pick up the pieces.  I'm not a sentimental balding 45 yr old rock critic yearning for the days of the 3 chord pop song to return either.  I just don't.... get this.

1302637,B004XNK7AI,Worst tuner I've ever used,"I own the SN-8, which btw, is the best tuner I've ever used. I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin. So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin. I was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this. Let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an A string and it tells you you are on E (when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem. I could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective. The one I received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great SN-8...I am disappointed in this thing. I must have just received a dud (I hope, since these usually get good reviews), but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly. On the flip side, I will be getting another SN-8 in it's place, since I know those are great tuners & I love the one I already have."

I used this when my daughter was on antibiotics and had horrible diarrhea, I immediately used this cream in hoped that it would prevent any rash, it didn't work at all, I kept using this and needless to say she ended up with a raw butt and I ended up emptying out my last bit of Lansinoh cream.This stuff smells horrible, you can smell it just holding your baby. I wouldn't mind the bad smell if this worked as great as people stated.And before people start wondering if I had her sit in her diaper, no, never.

3752634,B001G4Z5J0,Great carrier,"I purchased this to haul extra cargo behind a Toyota Highlander and I'm glad I purchased it.  We just used it for a 1500 mile round trip and it performed wonderfully.  I used it in conjunction with a hitch tightener to guard against bounce and sway.  I also purchased the Rolo LED tail light assembly that fits this carrier.  It held a cooler and several suitcases in a cargo bag very well.I used a torque wrench for assembly as directed, and things went smoothly.  I think that mine assembled a little crooked - either that or the hitch is a little askew, which is totally possible.  Regardless, I'm very pleased with the quality and build of this carrier.It is light enough for one person to carry and install.  Probably easiest to set the bottom on the ground and lean the tongue up onto the hitch before lifting into place, but feel free to install it however you like.  If you're feeling sporty you could try a sideways javelin toss if you have good aim and a steady arm.I'd recommend this to you if you want to carry extra cargo without climbing up on a step stool or ladder to load a rooftop carrier.  This is easy to access and it doesn't wreck gas mileage either.UPDATE 3/12/14:  Still a five star review from me.  I've used this a few times in two months and it remains easy and solid on the back of our suv.  After putting it in and out of the hitch a few times, the paint has chipped off the edge of the hitch attachment, which is to be expected.  Otherwise, no rust, and this has been through several rain storms.  We are very glad we have this for extra cargo.  We are getting a hitch extender that will allow us to mount a bike rack above it so we can use it when we go on vacation and take our four bikes with us."
2768496,B0007LPSFO,Ealing:  Sticking It to the Man,"Unlike the arbitrary nature of many box sets, EALING STUDIOS COMEDY COLLECTION has a unity of theme that runs from disc to disc: it collects the movies that best represent the studio's gently anti-authority personality.  Here they are in ascending order of preference:THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT (1953) was the studio's first color production, lensed beautifully by Douglas Slocombe.  It resembles the superior PASSPORT TO PIMLICO (same writer) in its story of a community fed up with governmental intrusions.  In between the laughs are some poignant observations about encroaching changes in the life of a close-knit village.  The sequence of the competing bus and train that keep criss-crossing each other is an example of how the right use of landscape and movement can sum up a whole story.  (I suspect Josh Logan stole this idea for the stunning closing shot of 1955's PICNIC.)A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY (1949) shows another side to Slocombe's mastery of the camera, with its hard edged look and noir lighting.  Director Charles Frend, freshly promoted from the editing room, gives us a perfectly-paced, madcap comedy of missed connections.  The movie pokes fun at the purple rhetoric standard in the news media's condescension toward ""the working man"" and his role as a ""gallant warrior in the Battle of Post-War Britain.""  With its exciting (foot) chase climax, this is an utterly charming, if lesser Ealing effort.Chronologically in the Ealing oeuvre, THE MAGGIE (1954) is probably the next-to-last great movie made by the studio, preceding THE LADYKILLERS in 1955.  It pits a blustering American businessman (with a VERY American sense of entitlement) against a grizzled Scottish conman whose sense of humor functions as Teflon to hard knocks, insults, or threats.  It's a clash of the titans in that rarest of comedies, the kind that leaves you clueless about who's the scoundrel and who's the victim.WHISKEY GALORE (1949) is set on the island of Todday off the west coast of Scotland.  It's inhabitants slump into a collective depression when wartime rationing leaves it without whiskey.  Once again, the story  centers around a figure of governmental authority, in this case a rather puffed-up Captain of Home Defense.  A ship carrying 50,000 cases of whiskey goes aground off the island's coast, and Home Defense is determined to protect its sinking cargo against the thirsty natives, just on principle.  Guess who comes out on top?  Brace yourself in the last moments for a veritable left hook of a punchline.PASSPORT TO PIMLICO (1949) is the flat-out masterpiece of the lot.  It succeeds at being both laden with subtext and light as a feather at the same time.  Its sarcastic opening dedication to rationing books leads the way into a multi-layered fantasy fulfillment comedy about a new, rich, and independent state rising up from within one of London's poorest neighborhoods.  Anarchic in spirit, merrily defiant in tone, PASSPORT stands as the blueprint for the best British comedy of the subsequent half-century plus.The DVD menus are the most stripped-down I've ever seen, offering ""Chapter Selections"" and ""Play.""  The set's booklet, however, is invaluable in placing these films in their historical and artistic context.EALING STUDIOS COMEDY COLLECTION, along with five or six other Ealing films, show that great movies can be made entirely with character actors.  These ensemble casts and recycled crews were, for a scant decade, The Marx Brothers of political satire and The Beatles of movie comedy."
1858416,B00005QK3W,8 songs too many...,"I read an article a few weeks ago in a publication, in it Paul had said he was planning on working on this (and was) in a similiar fashion as Revolver/Rubber Soul were created, meaning ""fresh"". This is anything but. There are 5 or 6 decent songs here, the rest are filler. He expiraments with some interesting techniques that oddly enough work quite well. The dark mood created on She's Given Up Talking is particularly rich and moving, unfortunately most of the album is sentimental rehashings that really say very little that wasn't said in previous efforts. I am most annoyed and dissappointed in the title song. Simply put Driving Rain is the worst song here. It's difficult for me to get my mind around how he felt this particular track had the strength of a title song, it's VERY weak.On the plus side, the production is very good. I like the back to basics stripped sound. Unfortuantely, the lyrics in particular are just generally uninteresting for the most part. And as much as it pains my patriotism, Freedom just has no hook and is not a good song. I like the first 3 songs, I like Heather, Spinning on an Axis, and Rinse the Raindrops and little else. (...) I love Paul and find a lot of his solo efforts (Flowers in the Dirt, a personnel fave) to be mixed, however, this one effort seems to be mostly mixed up. This cd could have been condensed considerably, that wouldn't help correct the lack of a true direction however it would have kept my finger off the ""skip"" button."

After maybe 20 hours of total use over this time, I realized the fan was not turning on.  Pulled and tested the switch -- no juice coming through.

22648,B003XOUM12,BEST BATTERY OUT THERE,"If you use the HTC Evo, you go through batteries like a hot knife through butter.  The advantage of the HTC over the iPhone, among other things is the ability to swap out a battery at will instead of waiting for the damn thing to recharge.  For this, you need multiple batteries and chargers.First the one you get is 1350 mAh.  Think if this number as a way to determine how long it will last.  These don't get you far.You can pick up some 1500 mAh batts on this site- they suck on many levels.  They somehow last less than the OEM; they never fit right so the back of the phone won't go on right; and they start to fall apart (yes- they fall apart).You can go buy the Seido 1750 mAh (or is it 1700?).  They're OK.  I had two of them.  But they were $40 a piece and for what?  They last a little longer than the OEM and they don't fall apart.Then there's the 3500 mAh but that thing is huge and you need a special back to fit on because it is essentially two no-frills batts stuck together.  No way.Last, theres these guys.  Pick o' the litter.  They fit just like the OEM, they come with a charger.  They are well built and do not start to fall apart at the third change.  They're CHEAP!! And they seemingly last forever.  The jump from 1700 mAh to 1900 mAh makes all the difference.  I am constantly checking my phone to see if it's time to change the battery and the damn thing hasn't even gone gold yet, never mind red!  Best by far.My only complaint is that if I'd known how long they lasted, I might not have bought four of them!"

They say the awful gameplay is made to be the way.After suffering through 4 hours of it, the gameplay never gets better. They say the story is what makes the game. How can a game be immersive when the guns sound like a toy? When every gun feels the same? When the controls just feel god awful and get you killed more often? I dont feel the story is exciting when the gameplay is so bad.First thing a game needs a good gameplay, then a story, then graphics. Spec ops goes story, graphics, ???, gameplay.Ill say this, for $5, if you dont like it, its not really money wasted. If you like playing an awful game for a great story, by all means buy this.But if you are like most gamers and care about gameplay foremost, skip this game at all costs."

1792762,B004VSPBO2,Don't Rely On This Kit For Your Safety Needs: Usefulness And Quantity Does Not Offset The Pricing,"I've gone my entire life without ever considering the need for a set of tape samples! Well, the good people at 3M (the premier brand of adhesives) thinks that this is just the idea that people have been clamoring for. They have unveiled an entire line of tape kits that have small amounts of a varied selection of their products. While this might seem like a sound idea, I still remain skeptical. Whenever you buy into a product assortment like this, there will be some items that you will use quickly and others that you might never need. I recently had the opportunity to obtain both the Safety Tape Kit and the College Dorm Tape Kit. And while each has its uses, neither is entirely necessary in my opinion. I've used some of each set, but doubt I'll have a practical use for everything included.College Dorm Tape Kit (2 1/2 stars): Of all the products in the new tape kit line, this actually seemed like the most useful one. College kids need all types of adhesives as they customize their dorm rooms or apartments.As expected, the set has useful pieces for hanging posters like hook pieces, loop pieces, and command strips. Some students might need wire management tape, others not. More marginally, there is even removable foam tape and post-it tape that can serve a variety of uses. I did like the glow tape and radiant light film tape additions as well. While no one would probably ever need these, they were neat and I think most would find a use for them. But the kit is heavy on duct tape, which probably will languish from disuse. Kids aren't going to use duct tape for color coding or labeling (as suggested), there are easier and more refined products for that use.Safety Tape Kit (1 1/2 stars): As someone who is responsible for workplace safety, I was particularly interested in this set. Again, though, these small samples don't give you the freedom to really do what you need to do in a real world situation.There is a bit of reflective tape (in two varieties), hazard tape, safety walk tape and glow tape as well as various colors of plain vinyl tape. In addition, there are a couple of command strips and some reclosable fasteners. In truth, I found this set virtually worthless. Why? Workplace safety is a lot more essential than decorating a college dorm. Buying this set won't help you with much of anything. If you actually need the included products, they don't really come in any quantity to make a real difference. You'll just end up at your local hardware store buying what you really need.In short, these tape kits are a novel idea. But the usefulness does not offset the price! Figure out what you really need and buy ONLY that in quantity. Don't waste your dollars on some items that you'll never use and others that you'll still need to buy more of. KGHarris, 4/14."

1604700,B002AQJEAO,Wickedly Good,"I was apprehensive about ordering these when they were in the Gold Box, but I thought they would make a good last minute gift.  Since I didn't know how they would taste and didn't want to give a gift that was awful, I HAD to taste them.  I thought they were quite good.  Addicting, in fact.  I better hurry up and give away the other 5 canisters!  They are not a bitter chocolate, so if that's what you expect when you see ""dark chocolate,"" then you may be disappointed.  I actually prefer milk chocolate, but I didn't find it as sweet as many milk chocolate products.  There are two sealed packages of these rolled cookies in each canister.  They should easily stay fresh.  I'm sure most will find something to use the canisters for when the cookies are gone."
2215093,6302717639,Attractive Shell - Hollow Interior,"I had to see Lana Turner with Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. or the other way around. It was a curiosity - superstar with very moderate actor. No doubt, Zimbalist has the GQ looks and a wonderful speaking voice, but very limited acting range.. He was at the peak of the popularity of ""77 Sunset Strip"" at this time. In that, he mainly had to be cool with a certain superior air. There were some lively characters about him to offset. Then, in the middle of his FBI series (sober, taciturn type there), he co-starred in ""Wait Until Dark"" with Audrey Hepburn. Same as here - just basically filled the suit. Saw he did some stage work early on and worked steadily through the decades, while others with his level of talent faded away. He was fortunate in his TV projects.But this is a typical melodrama, popular during this era, especially with Turner. Everyone was at some stage of pathetic. That would except the Thomas Mitchell character, who was a breath of fresh air. They could have called this ""All Fall Down and Can't Get Up.""  It really needed to go through several rinse cycles to clear out all the suds. The visuals were the stars:  stately homes, well appointed rooms, rich paneling, beautiful fall trees. One reviewer trying to make the best of it commented that at least these drab folks had colorful backdrops.There have been other films with the same deficits as this one that have managed to come across. Sometimes the higher caliber actors can pull it out, and there were some of those here. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.  Someone must have called for flat line, and they all adhered. The simultaneous reconciliations at the end were so low on the meter, they hardly registered. This one lacked a pulse from beginning to dead end."
1791054,B004NK6Q7Y,5 star value!,"I've used this head lamp several times in the last year. Yes it is pretty cheaply made as others have noted. I guess that's why it's only 6 bucks ;-)The battery compartment has a soft rubber cover. It is easy to peel off and press on, to replace batteries. There is a small metal ring to keep it attached so you won't misplace it- nice touch. It is even curved slightly to match the contour of one's head.When you push the small silver button once, the light turns on 'high'. Push again for 'low', again for 'high strobe', and again for 'off'. You must always cycle thru these modes. There is no memory. The light is hinged and can point straight ahead, or angle it down.It is very bright, which means it eats batteries pretty fast. I use Eneloop or Lacrosse rechargeable batteries. It uses 3 AAA only. The product description now says it can also use 18650. That is not true.I would not want my life to depend on this head lamp, but so far it works fine (I also have a Fenix HL20 that is hopefully more dependable, but of course every product can and will fail). I use this mostly while woodworking, because I don't want my nice Fenix to get all dusty or stained. I feel I already got my few dollars worth out of this product. If this light breaks tomorrow I will probably order 2 or 3 more."
3639957,B000QDIU6M,The best I've found,"Using the usual hard plastic scoops found in the local store was difficult. The back where I gripped the handle was sharp and dug into my hand while I sifted through the litter. THIS litter scoop is well padded so one does not get any sharp or deep pressure when sifting through the sometimes-heavy litter. It has 2 screens so the smaller bits that fall through the usual scoops is caught and can be disposed of. However, after only about 4 months, the front started coming apart, where I dig into the litter opening up so that litter bits get stuck, thus widening it further.  If you choose this product, scoop from the side, then it will last longer.However, I've now found the best litter scooper ever, the Litter-Lifter which is easy to use, light, durable and gets all the bits from the pan, small and large, it handles them all well. This one has wedge-shaped tines that do catch all the clumps better than any other. Too bad it's not yet on Amazon, I hope to see it here in future!"

2569028,B00005U12T,Just Shock For Shock's Sake,"It's terrible. any artistic merit for this movie was lost on me after the rape scene. The acting is really not that fantastic (although it's a shame we no longer have Karen Lancaume/Black/Bach in this world - she was a talent that could have been nurtured). The story is set around an attempt to shock and the ending is kind of pointless, too. I love French extreme cinema, so the shock effect was not what turned me off - it's the deliberate (and yet failed) attempt to shock. Better off viewed on the internet so you don't waste your money."

The nice flat spoon end is gentle on the walls, so I had no mars to fix on removing several hundred feet of baseboards and casings.

Perhaps they liked the shape of the banana, as they could wrap their bodies around it as they bit and kicked the cr@p out of it, LOL!Unfortunately, like all their other toys, the novelty wore off after a few days ... but then I just put the banana away and pulled it back out after a week, and they went crazy for it all over again!"

If they assist me with installation i will comeback and update my review."

1694865,B00004RGVZ,Cobalt bits are the way to go!,"I've had drill bits that I have to replace after time. These are great, I've been told by many people that colbalt bits are the way to go. Been great with my dewalt drill, drilling through wood, metal and drywall. Overall I'd buy these again and again. Couldn't ask for a better drill bit."
91837,B0087PMTDG,late delivery but perfect item,I revived this case in more than one (1) MONTH but the quality and shape is perfect. Easy to put it on and all cuts are at their right place. I would order more if they sent it sooner.
1586782,B001EO616S,Can't beat the price,"Good luck finding a lower price on natural honey! I've bought this 4-pack several times with Amazon's subscribe & save deal. I use honey in my tea and recipes, and I make mead with it. This one has a vaguely spicy, but still delicate flavor. The only thing I can think to compare it to is cinnamon but it's much more subtle. Very delicious. The bottles are nothing special, kind of thin, and I have to saw the top off to get the honey to come out easily, but don't let that stop you from buying some! I urge anyone to try this honey if you're looking for natural, healthy honey, or if you want to get away from the filtered mass-marketed honey that is often smuggled illegally into the U.S."
1626727,B0041NYV8E,too sharp for me,"I love both ginger and lemon, and I love the flavors together. However, I couldn't finish this drink.I received one packet to try as a sample and I made it hot and followed the instructions. It dissolved nicely.But, the taste of the ginger was so sharp and pungent that I couldn't finish it. I let it cool down (I only had the one packet) and still did not like it. How disappointing!BTW, if you're looking at this product because you love ginger and lemon together, you should try Carr's Ginger Lemon Creme cookies. They are amazing!"
1639356,B004OCCKYE,My favorite of all Atkins bars,I don't like their cinnamon breakfast bar at all - hard and tastes more like maple. This is soft and crumbly like a gouremet cookie~  Never get tired of it! And it seems to stabelize your blood sugar quickly!

1293746,B00005ML71,Definitely Not For The Seasoned Piano Player,"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion, a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."
1636408,B004JRKEH4,Resturaunt Style Sauce for the Home,"I've long been a fan of Taco Bell's sauces and have often taken a few dozen packets of their mild sauces home to use in my own creations.  Problem was that I couldn't take any of the larger sauces home like their chipotle sauce due to the fact that they don't keep any in the main lobby.  Fortunately, they decided to make a bottled version available for mass distribution so us amateur chefs could come up with our own mixtures.The sauce is good; I've been using it in my Mexican dishes such as quesadillas, tacos, and even some breakfast sandwishes.  It works well with just about anything I've put it on that requires a little more spice.  It certainly adds flavor.  I have yet to try and work it into anything fried or Italian (Taco Bell mild sauce works insanely well with sauted spaghetti meat), but I'm sure I'll figure it in somehow.All in all, a well worthy purchase."
500820,B00AX2EI62,Ain't Just Whistling Dixie,"Readers may think that my enthusiasm for this impulse buy is mere hyper bowly, but let be assure you it is not.My pulse was on target when I purchased this nicely priced add on product from Amazon.The bowls are nicely constructed to securely hold soups, cereal, juicy fruits, ice cream, or salads. You can even fill these little guys with potato salad, mashed potatoes, or a measured serving of fries. There are times when you just want a little and for whatever reason would rather not wash out a bowl.The Dixie bowls are even trustworthy enough to use to serve my dogs some doggy ice cream or a spoonful of yogurt.Bottom line - Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head like these bowls a lot, and I can foresee a future repeat purchase."

3693622,B003TUQWB4,Hard to put together & offers no protection,I got this for 2 chihuahuas...You sit this on the seat it does not hang. So the majority of the area is not usable. The &#34;shelf&#34; inside sits only a few inches from the actual top. In the event of a quick stop it throws them right out. Even with a harness on it is a scary ordeal. Mine also came without the strap to hook the harness to. It was VERY hard to get the pieces together & now they won't come apart for me to return this item. I highly suggest the other seat we tried & are keeping. It came from here on Amazon as well it's the &#34;Solvit Tagalong Pet Booster Seat&#34;.
1834007,B000002GXU,One of Browne's best,"Jackson Browne in the 1970s recorded some of the best American rock'n'roll ever.  &quot;Late for the Sky,&quot; is one of his classics and perhaps his most emotionally enthralling.  The best songs are the title track,  &quot;For a Dancer&quot; (covered recently by Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou  Harris on &quot;The Western Wall&quot; album) and the emotionally charged,  end-of-the-world epic &quot;Before the Deluge.&quot;  The singing, playing  and production are first rate.  This is a must have album for fans of 70s  rock."
1325797,B00005O0I2,An Amazing Game On All Levels,"Crime does pay. Just take Grand Theft Auto 3 for a spin and after 5 minutes, you'll see what I mean. Because this isn't the 2D paper graphic crime-sim found in the first two instalments that made you sick to your stomach trying to move around the city. Third times the charm they say, as now there's a huge 3D world of pedestrians, mobsters, cars, guns and even pimps just waiting to be mauled by your hand. Tempted? Who wouldn't be? After all Grand Theft Auto 3 is the most incredible game I've seen in a long time, it shattered all expectations I had for it, and let me tell you I was expecting a hell of a lot from this one.You're the nameless thug once again, a small-time crook who's betrayed and left for dead during a bank robbery gone stale. Now, an escaped convict, with the help of a bombs expert 8-Ball, you'll easily become Liberty Cities number one with a bullet in no time. Jobs begin small, giving rides to various mafia members, stealing cars and occasionally clubbing someone to ""customers"" of your employers, but as you move you're way up, you'll soon find yourself performing tasks worthy of ""The Professional"" stature. There are various people and organizations who will offer jobs around the city; these can be accepted by stopping by their place of business or answering pay phones on the street. And if completed you'll be rewarded with cold hard cash and accomplishing certain mission's gives you access to new weapons and safe houses.Along with money, comes protection just like the others which is a very nice addition to Grand Theft's gameplay, if the cops are after you and are led to an area where you have accomplished missions (Lets say the Mafia area) the mobsters walking on the street will help kill them off. However, along with this comes my first complaint with Grand Theft Auto 3, progressing through the story you're bound to make one group pissed off, therefore, any time you may be walking through they'll try to kill you, which is believable when you're on foot since they have a face to see but these people even know it's you when you're in a car with tinted windows! This makes in extremely frustrating when certain missions require you to back track. Apparently they still haven't seen a need to fix that problem that even plagued the first two.The missions offered contain a nice versatile selection, throughout the game so you won't feel like you're repeating the same task again and again just with the difficulty levelled up. It can vary from little tasks like swatting some annoying drug dealers scattered around the city, stealing fancy automobiles for a collector and escorting your mob bosses in a limo to a meeting. However, once the kiddy work is over, things really heat up, blowing up a docked ship in the harbor, breaking someone out of prison and holding off a group of heavily armed Columbians with military class weaponry. Fortunately these missions increase at a nice pace so you'll never feel that the task is too hard and way out of your leagueA very helpful addition to Grand Theft Auto's gameplay is the ability to prepare for you missions, if you play through once and fail, you can take the job again, but this time around if you now what to expect you can literally use the city to your advantage. For example, in one mission you must kill a Godfather like character before he reaches his mansion; he has two escort cars containing armed personnel. So, remember where his house was and utilizing the gate that leads into his mansion, I set two vans in the way of the entrance so his limo would have to push pretty hard to break through. Using this time, I jumped on top of one of the parked vans and shot his guards, then dropped a grenade onto his hood and ran for cover. And you'd better believe it worked.This game has so much freedom in all the things you can do, as you probably guess from what I said above, it seems like the game that contains all of those times when you said ""I wish I could do that"" in a game. You can steal any car you want and even keep it by parking it in a garage so it's there whenever you want it, plow down sidewalks, leap off of ramps, ride in a police boat armed with machine guns or find a nice rooftop and pick off people with a sniper rifle. So much freedom, you'll say this is a ""real"" world.The cities are huge and connected in three parts, and get this the only time this game has to load (which is only about 6 seconds within itself) is when you go to a different part of the city you could spend as long as you want in one area and never have a loading time, or even a split-second of slowdown. Every you'll visit is huge with people littering the streets, some of which may even try to steal your car if you're not paying attention. There's dozens of classes for pedestrians you'll encounter, the rich girl, hillbilly, gangster, prostitutes, bums (some even have a bottle of alcohol that can be used as a Molotov cocktail) and my favourite the gay construction worker. All of them spit out various one liners that are quite amusing, as are the many radio ads and call-in-shows like Chatterbox, they all work to give things a better sense of reality.But cause enough trouble and the boys in blue will come running. Your ""Wanted Meter"" is displayed by 6 stars, if one lights up you'll have officers on foot who'll try to beat you down, get two stars and they'll use guns, three and the police helicopters come as well as the S.W.A.T. teams. And if you survive four, the fifth will bring M-16 toting F.B.I. agents and if all else fails, six stars brings in the tanks, by then, you're pretty much screwed, buy kudos for lasting that long. When arrested you'll automatically fail any mission that's in progress and wind up at the police station (feel free to take one of the parked police cars if you'd like), or when you're life reaches zero you'll wind up at the hospital, but rest easy knowing there's no lives or the number of chances you get. You can keep coming back as often as you want.Here I've written two pages and almost on my third, and there's still so much to tell about what Grand Theft Auto 3 has to offer. So I'm better off just saying that Grand Theft Auto 3 is by far the most fun I've had in years. A fan of the first two or not, I can guarantee everyone will love this game as much as I did, you'd be insane not to add this to your PS2 collection."

The results: one parent was a Collie / American Eskimo Dog and the other parent was a English Cocker Spaniel / Mix Breed. Of the Mixed Breed the likelyhood was a pit terrier. I can see were he may have some spaniel, and I'm sure he is a terrier - But Collie/Eskimo Dog? No way - at lease not 1st generation. Tempted to send a picture this time and request a re-test to see if we get a different result.  Fun to look at but a waste of money."

I have quite an arsenal of Detailing supplies (ask the Mrs, She wants to strangle me) Literally a few thousand dollars worth. I have put honest effort into all of the metal polishes I have used in the past and none of them stack up to Simichrome. Flitz metal polish is a distant second. If you can find the old Brasso in the metal can grab it! Its the old formula made prior to the VOC regulation changes and it is amazing. Simichrome paste is pretty damn close to Brasso if not better."

1895383,0767809246,My Favorite Movie!!!,"Listen, you have to see this movie. In my opinion, it's the best movie ever made! ""Stand By Me"" stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and Kiefer Sutherland. These guys put on the performance of a lifetime. This movie deals with one of the most important things in life... friendship. This movie was directed by Rob Reiner, and was based on the novella ""The Body"" by Stephen King. Everytime I watch this movie I get a lump in my thoat. This movie will make you laugh, but it could very well make you cry. If you love drama, get ""Stand By Me""..."

3233241,B003IY498Y,After.Life or how even hours of naked breasts couldn't hold my interest,"I am going to discuss the thriller for and by nudists, After.Life.Here's the gist...Christina Ricci is a school teacher who is full of ennui and malaise. She takes pills and dates Justin Long and generally has a pouty vacant look on her face all the time, which we all know is the visual depiction of depression in moviedom. Christina Ricci is cold and mean to Justin Long but he is just so infatuated with that ""Precious Moments"" face of hers, he has to fight for the love. The love that is painfully absent and never really existed in the first place if flashbacks are to be believed. Oh yeah, Christina Ricci also has a creepy student who is apparently supposed to be the love child of Danny from The Shining.Anywho, depression and pills and the hysteria that comes with her lady parts causes Christina Ricci to get in an accident because we all know ladies can't drive. The next thing we know, Christina Ricci wakes up on a slab to Liam Neeson, the town's funeral director/mortician/creeper, leering over her and telling her she died in the accident. And Christina Ricci is all like ""Whuuuut?! Nuh uh!"" and Liam Neeson is like ""For real. Now I have to cut your clothes off so you can be naked for the next 90 minutes.""And that's it. The suspense for the rest of the film hinges on whether Liam Neeson is telling truth about Christina Ricci's new status as dead-but-sexy zombie-ghost or if she is actually alive and Qui Gonn is just a psycho.This film certainly asks you to make some leaps of logic. Like whatever town this is has the most inept emergency responders ever. This accident, which is supposed to be the worst car accident in the history of the world, results in Christina Ricci having a cut on her forehead. That's it. No bruises. No broken bones. Just a cut. On her forehead. Obviously, when the police and EMTs showed up, the rookie took one look at her and puked while the grizzled veteran said something like ""Poor bastard."" before they put her in a body bag and handed her over to the Nees. Or how about how Liam Neeson keeps injecting Christina Ricci with 10,000 CCs of ""muscle relaxer"" to prevent ""rigor""? Either Christina Ricci's school district has the laxest hiring requirements ever or she faked some credentials somewhere along the line because she is the dumbest teacher ever to fall for that bunk.This proves to be the undoing of the film. The filmmakers keep making it seem pretty obvious which way this thing is going to turn out but then throw in these inexplicable ""or is it?"" moments that make you reevaluate your previous assumptions. That's all well and good to keep the suspense going but the whole fun of these movies is the reveal at the end where they tell you what is really going on. That never comes in this movie. They just keep making u-turns on the path through the whole damn thing, to the very last frame. LAME.Liam Neeson gives a good performance and the film does have flashes of quality in it but it is ultimately disappointing. Justin Long is not charming or likable at all. Christina Ricci phones in her performance and let's her boobs do the talking on the other end of the line. I had high hopes but it was a disappointment."

1296354,B0002GXZK4,Great value,"I don't own one, but have been playing my sister-in-law's for the last year when visiting. Didn't know much about the guitar, but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship. Changed the strings, and, other than the action being a little high, it's as good as anything I've played for under $500. I honestly thought it cost around $350, so I was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than $100. It's definitely a great value.In part because of my experience with this guitar, I purchased a Takamine G Series 12-string last year, (for considerably more money), and it's simply incredible."
3760124,B007Y4BL1C,Not a good experience...even before it was out of the box.,"Unfortunately, I believe they sent me a return/refurb product.  You know that ""need a chainsaw to cut open melted plastic security packaging"" we all love to hate that electronics seemed to be packed in?  Well, this came in that, however, there was a cut about 3/4 the way up the package...just enough to pull the unit out and put the unit back in its packaging.  The box it was delivered in showed no signs of damage and that security plastic of death just can't rip on its own.Secondly, I was amazed to find 2 missing components (wondering if it is standard for all of this type, or if it was just missing in mine):  screws to permanently mount and most importantly an insulated copper wire to ground the unit.  If you're going to give us the option to screw it down in a vehicle, then supply the screws.  If you are going to sell a product that should be grounded, then help your customer by supplying that ground wire for crying out loud.It's also very important to note this can only supply 140W of power when using the in car power plug (ie, for your radar detector etc).  The only way you get to 400W is direct connect to the cars battery.I do like the fact that it has dual AC sockets, however, it really needs more than a single USB plug.  My intended use would be for trips and with only one USB charger, that doesn't work when you have more than one kiddo.I would recommend either going to a different model with more ports if you have kids."

1583133,B001E5E0B0,Kashi has brought cereal back into my life,"When I was a kid I ate cereal all the time for breakfast.  As I got older, I started to get away from the cereal in favor of things like whole-grain English muffins.  This was because the cereals out there were either chock full of sugar or ""healthy"" and, therefore, tasteless with a cardboard-like texture.  Kashi to the rescue!I particularly love this cereal because of the honey flavor.  It is a nice, light flavor and has what I consider to be the perfect degree of sweetness.  Unlike with sugar cereals, I don't have the sensation of instant tooth decay when I eat this one.  Better yet, the cereal is a blend of whole grains.  I find that eating this cereal and other Kashi products helps me to stay full longer and also makes me less likely to crave sugary goods.  I've long been reluctant to let my daughter eat much cereal for breakfast for the abovementioned reasons but she loves this cereal just as much as I do.  It's definitely gratifying to be able to serve my daughter something that she not only loves, but that I know is also healthy for her."
1601750,B0026KJQ0W,Good for Preschoolers too!,"My son is 3 and has been eating these ""veggie packets"" since he first started solids. I thought he'd grow out of them and actually stopped buying them for a while. I started seeing the apple sauce versions of these for older kids, and thought I might as well see if he'd like these as a snack still. He loves them! It is like a veggie smoothie. Yes, I've tasted them. They are good!These are a great, easy way to add some veggies in when you're in a rush. I pack some in the car, on hikes, etc. Excellent for busy families! My son actually asks for them at least once a day.Make sure you read the nutritionals though, as some of these have a better nutritional value than others (obviously based on the mix). I also recommend buying them on subscribe & save, as they are a bit expensive."
443708,B005ACNPLO,Just May Convert Me from Shaving Cream,"At first this product reminded me of the times when I'd run out of shaving foam at home and had to use skin lotion instead, not always with the best results.  But after my first shave with it, I was hooked. This gel is very soothing and smoothing on the skin, and has a pleasant, kind of fruit-herby aroma.  Most importantly, it gave me a nice, close shave, and its clear low-foaming formula make it much easier to see where you're going with the razor - a plus for anyone like me who maintains a beard.  It's also much easier cleanup than a foam, and leaves your skin soft and refreshed.  I highly recommmend it."
390290,B003AYEHMK,"MADE IN CHINA, so I threw it away.","I threw out this product as soon as I saw on the package that it was MADE IN CHINA.After the recent, tragic food contamination events in China (contaminated milk that resulted in infant deaths, contaminated pet food that killed hundreds of pets) and the shocking revelation that the USDA rarely and superficially inspects imported foods for possible contamination, I throw out anything edible that comes from China.  It makes no difference to me that it bears the USDA Organic stamp, and I'll explain this below.I need to see dependable evidence that the Chinese are taking measures to clean up their end of food inspection, analysis, and production before I trust food grown/manufactured in China.NEWS: Since October 2005, most of ""organic"" spirulina was from the USA.  Two major USA companies have both ceased production of ""organic spirulina"" due to the USDA terminating the use of a fertilizer (sodium bicarbonate extracted from sea water) which was originally permitted as an ""organic"" feed for the growth of spirulina. Since sodium bicarbonate is extracted and made to be used in chemical form, it cannot pass the USDA test as an ""organic"" substance.I could have sent a letter of complaint to the seller.  I could have sent back the product.  That's not the point.I want sellers of food or anything I put into my body and on my skin to tell me, the consumer-customer, where the product is grown and where it is processed and packaged.My consumer reviews on Amazon are my way of alerting other consumers about product issues and concerns.  Remember, the consumer-customer is king. If we don't buy, they don't stay in business.I now purchase the more expensive spirulina that is grown, processed, and packed in vacuum packed bottles in Hawaii. It's not the cheapest spirulina available.  I'll pay more for safety and quality for things I put into my body that affect my health.Two other sources of spirulina I would trust are (1) Earthrise Farms in California's Sonoran Desert, [...];  and  (2) Australian Spirulina, Product of Australia in Darwin, Australia on Australia's tropical northern-central coastal area, [...]. The Austrailian government' stringent controls over food quality would put our USDA to shame.Hawaii grown spirulina is sold under the brand, Nutrex Hawaii, Hawaii Spirulina Pacifica. I phoned their offices in Kailua-Kona Hawaii and asked about their products which are grown, processed, and packaged in glass bottles in Hawaii.  They use Kona deep sea (2000 ft depth) water. This information is also on their website.  You can call them yourself toll free at 1-800-453-1187, or write to them: Nutrex Hawaii 73-4460 Queen Kaahumanu Hwy, Suite 102, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii 96740.Spirulina is grown in tropical climates because it needs maximum sunshine. You can buy spirulina products grown in India, China (southern areas) Taiwan, Thailand and Mexico (the Mexican facility may no longer exist). Japan is too cold to grow its own spirulina products, so I assume Japanese companies source their spirulina from other countries. There is a grower of spirulina in Okinawa but it is for research purposes only and not for commercial production.CONCLUSION:  Always ask the seller where, exactly, your food/spirulina is grown.  Always seek food grown in the cleanest environment (pollution free air, water, and soil).  Become a food detective.  Most people research the car they want to buy more thoroughly than the food they put into their children's mouths.TEST:  Of these five things, which would you least want to have destroyed or eliminated: (1) Your car (2) Your TV (3) Your house (4) Your job (5) Your body and health.  There is only one correct answer.  Nothing else matters if you die prematurely from slow food poisoning.Keep well.  You only have one body to live in."
1816657,B00CP74JO4,Great!,"So far so good with these bulbs.  I purchased these to fit in a tight spot in my ceiling fan.  Normally I can only fit 60w equivalent CFL in there.  With those, the color was either too yellow or too white.  These bulbs are great. These appear more along the lines of a regular incandescent bulb.  Skin tones look more natural and I am very pleased. The bonus came from getting 75watt equivalent in a normal light bulb size, so I had no issue with fitment.  So far in use for a few weeks with no issue to date.  Will update if any fail."
1400307,B000XJNTPG,A game about heavy metal?,"Okay, so the concept of a game being based on heavy metal is a little silly and this game knows it. With Jack Black voicing the main character one can expect a comical yet effective performance. The single player campaign is loads of fun with the free-roaming style of play akin to Grand Theft Auto or an MMO like World of Warcraft or the like. Luckily, you get a car which you can summon to make traveling quicker and easier. This game is a fighter at heart but gives you other types of gameplay as well. The vehicle you drive also has weapons so killing enemies with your machine guns or simply running them over is a game-type in itself. On top of the fighting style gameplay, you're thrust into ""stage battles"" (which is the multiplayer mode as well versus other players online). These stage battles have elements of an RTS (Real time strategy) in which you can control the movements of your troops and battle over resources called ""fans geysers"" which allow you to purchase units and upgrades to your stage.I haven't done too much multiplayer but I feel like this could be the best part of the game. The story is funny, exciting, cartoonish and memorable. And although the side-missions available in the campaign lack variety and thoughtfulness, they're rather short and not too difficult.$20 for this game is a more than reasonable price, especially if you're only interested in the single player campaign as there is little replay value in that. But if you take the dive into the online multiplayer I'm sure that those that learn the game mechanics will enjoy this game even more. I'd recommend this game for the bargain price especially if you enjoy online games."

Diddy and Voletta wallace, but this album is confused and totally unfocused, although there are so good songs on there especially the Bob Marley/Biggie song, but the rest is just a major drift and it doesn't even decided how good the rest of the album is.Although this is not as bad as another posthumous rapper's album(2Pac's Loyal to the game was even worse than this one), but this is still not enough."

3761583,B00CCOBOI4,Meh,"I was really looking forward to putting this on my truck.  You have to apply it in 'warmer' weather (65+ if I recall) so make sure to plan accordingly.In the end, there's a LOT to do to try to get this right.  I didn't get it 'right' the first time, but was able to reset.  Likewise, a kit doesn't cover much.  It's basically good for a front bra, but you'd need quite a few to, say, cover the hood.There's also a ton of prep work, but that's kind of to be expected.I probably won't use this again.  It does work, but it's such a pain that I'd rather just take it to a shop, pay a bit more to have someone else do it, and have a bit more confidence in the application.I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review."

I ordered this Pet Park for my little 5lb Chi to use in the sunroom when its bad out.  I put a peepee pad between the turf and the base then followed my little girl outside with a paper plate to collect some urine to spinkle on the turf so it will smell and giver her an idea of what the Potty is for.  She walks and sits on the turf but hasn't ""used"" it yet...thats fine cause I'm not that anxious to start washing it!  When the snow starts flying I'm confident she will take advantage of her indoor potty!  The Pet Park Potty arrived new in perfect condition and fast!  Even though my little girl hasn't used it yet, I'm very happy to have it on hand before a snow storm and would recommend it for whatever reason someone may have for needing an indoor dog potty.Edit: My little 6 year old rescue chi did learn to use the potty on her own during a severe storm.  Be sure to keep a clean pp pad under the turf and check it!  I didn't keep an eye on mine and PHEW... smelly!!!  I'm soaking the whole thing in Murphy's and HOT WATER right now!  Yuck!Edit: This worked like it should for my little dog... But I can't seem to get the yucky smell out!  We have a covered porch at the end of 4 garage bays... Im taking it there and sticking with pp pads inside:)"

1871247,B0009SCVTG,Thoughts of a tax write off,"Question: When did Yayo bust a decent verse? Answer: on G-unit's diss record/love jam I Smell P****. This album being garbage should be of no surpise to anybody. Songs like Homicide, G-s***, Eastside Westside, We Dont Give A F***, So Seductive and Pimpin have dope production but Yayo sucks so these songs suck right along with Yayo. Other tracks that stink: Drama Setter(Obie verse was alright but the track is still suspect), Curious(commecial garbage that would make Jarule blush), Project Princess(more sappy love jams from Tony Playdoh), Love My Style(nobody does!) Its Is What It Is and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: Tony Yayho's Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon is the worst album of 2005 without question. Lame beats  and weak rhymes from Tony and friends plus what is up with all that screaming he does? What is he trying to be? A New York Version of Lil Jon? Use this cd for what its good for. A projectile weapon against rabid rottweilers! /you aint the talk of New York/ your sixteens is boring/(Game on 300 Bars)."
3614039,B0006N9LN8,Nice dog supplement,"I bought this because all of a sudden my dog ( an 8+ y/o, 20 pound Lhasa Apso) started eating the dirt, even what was under the snow in the winter, and out of all the planters that he could reach. I presumed that he was missing something in his diet that he was trying to make up for. So after reading many reviews, I settled on a trial of this one, since it was specifically meant for small breeds.So this is what I am presuming: since starting this supplement, even at half the suggested daily dose, there have no more forages into the planters. I imagine that he is being provided with whatever  he needed.The powder is easily mixed into his other ingredients, I add a tiny bit of water, and have had no digestive consequences.I will continue to buy this and add to his diet."

1297898,B000AC6DVS,Did not work for me,"Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and I have used the standard model for some time. It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.I used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.Later I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought, I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. Worked great.So I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. They now ship without the clips. Company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though I didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No problem getting the refund, but I'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.If you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the OM model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else."

1866600,B00018D44U,Oh what a crashing bore!,"Not content to be the world's most dreary Jazz singer, Ms Jones has decided to give Country music her own 'dulls-ville' treatment.I have heard this recording quite a few times now in my shop and I can honestly say that it is dull and unmemorable. I challenge anyone to 'connect' with the prosaic songs featured on this album. The songs start, hang around for a few minutes - with Ms Norah Jones making the sounds that she does, and then stop. Some of the instrumental playing is pleasant and I remember one guitar solo that wasn't bad. As for the voice of Ms Norah Jones, it is hard to find anything interesting about it. She has a very limited tessitura (probably less than an octave). Her vocal expression is so limited that it hard to say if any song she is singing is happy or sad. The disinterest she seems to exhibit in her own material seems to be the only palpable quality she can convey in a song. I wonder if she even listens to her own material?No doubt, fans of her first album will rush out to buy this album. I wouldn't be surprised if many of them are disappointed. Compared to &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, her first album positively rocked!!! At best, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; will put you to sleep; at  worst, it is a dull, irritating and pointless album made by one of the world's most over-rated pop stars. Let me tell you, I'd rather listen to ten hours of non-stop sitar music than &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;!If you want a decent Country album, go out and buy an Emmylou Harris album or anything by Johnny Cash!"

3748005,B000EDOSME,free replacement unit,"The first unit I received would not hook up with the gasket installed. It appeared very tight without the gasket, so I used it with near perfect success. Had I purchased a clear extender, I would have flushed longer, but that is in the past. The second attempt to use the product it appeared to fit a little looser, so I attempted to use the gasket. Well, all four ears broke off the pump assembly. I was able to get a replacement unit at Camping World, as I explained I had only used it once, and it was now unusable. They replaced the unit ""no questions asked"" and the new unit had its gasket more deeply seated, and hooked up fine. My R V was equipted with black and grey tank washers, but never having a clear section of hose, it is now obvious that the black tank was never throughly cleaned. After multiple flushes, the water finally ran mostly clean. I recommend you nevere dump without a clear section of hose so that you can tell when the job is done."

AND the serving size/cost per month was impractical.I have a toy poodle so he only needed 1/2 soft chew a day.  I easily split the chew.  But, I also have a german shepherd and had i given it to him, he would have needed 2 soft chews a day (he is 80 lbs)---which is around 24 dollars a month----not really very practical in my opinion."

The smell is remarkably weaker than the product I bought in the Art of Shaving stores and the consistency of the product also feels thinner, not the thick luxurious texture of the shave cream I'm used to.

It left a dull film on my stove that I had to buff out with a paper towel and some muscles.Also note that the Vine reviewers (myself included) got several packs of free pads--it doesn't look to me like this $14 version contains any cleaning pads at all. To get that, you have to buy the starter pack for $20. You can get a pack of 40 reusable green scrubbers for less money."

1848605,B00000DGV2,The best live Rush album,"Rush - Different Stages - Live (1998) is, in my opinion, the best Rush album out of their many in their catalog.  This three disc set features a great lineup of songs.  My favorite of the three discs is Set Three, which contains Bastille Day, By-Tor & The Snow Dog, Xanadu, Farewell To Kings, Something For Nothing, Cygnus X-1, Anthem, Working Man, Fly By Night, In The Mood, and Cinderella Man.  Lots of good stuff permeates this album.  This set showcases songs spanning Rush's entire career.  If you're a fan of older Rush like I am, you'll find a lot of old stuff, such as The Trees, Limelight, 2112 (in its entirety), Analog Kid, Natural Science, YYZ, The Spirit of Radio, and much more.Overall, I highly recommend this live Rush album over all the others in their catalog."
1861886,B000075A20,He paid the cost to be a moron.,"I remember when I was a youngster in 1993 and everybody and their mama were listening to Snoop Dogg. Or as he was known then, Snoop DOGGY Dogg. I was eleven and I bought the cassette single to Gin And Juice, and found it entertaining. I was ELEVEN. What did I know?Anyway, you would have thought Snoop was the second coming of Christ back then.But Snoop Dogg isn't Christ. He's a misogynistic moron who makes money off of the image of pimping and disrespecting women. Remember when he showed up at the VMA's with dog collars and leashes around those women's necks? How fitting for a dude who treats women like animals anyway. Very classy. See, if you listen to MUCH of his vomit-inducing music, you understand that Snoop sees women as objects to be sexed and exploited, not  human beings to be loved and understood. That's why when he DOES pay homage to women in songs like Beautiful, I take it with a grain of salt because I know that's not the real him.Snoop Dogg is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no trouble getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you; so you go and find a ""nice girl"" because you can respect, marry, and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with ""bad girls"" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the ""bad girls"" because they're [...], so you go back to the ""good girl."" But she's not nasty enough for you, so...around and around we go. Women are being punished for men's inability to make up their minds or to live in the 21st century.Since the way a man treats women usually starts with experiences with his mother, I'm led to believe he must have witnessed his mom selling herself on the street corner for an ounce of crack. It screwed up his image of women forever. The best treatment Snoop can give a woman he claims to love (his wife) is to cheat on her openly with groupies and make porn in the backyard.I guess the whole ""pimp theez hoez, I'm a gangsta on parole, cursing 1000 times during shows"" thing is admirable and entertaining if your I.Q. is equal to your shoe size.I'll give him 2 stars for...Beautiful...notice in one of the few songs he does show respect to women he makes the video about Latin women, not black women. Of course, we know how he feels about us. Don't we?And the 2nd star is for mentioning Chilli from TLC in his From the Chuuuch to the Palace song."

1834065,B000002GYL,"I'm sorry, but this guy just bores me","So Jackson, who was clearly listening to a lot of Bob Dylan records at the time, decided he wanted to be like a certain critically acclaimed, commercially successful living legend/cynical street poet with a really bad voice - only with a considerably better voice (technically speaking, anyway) and soft-rock instrumentation. Really, he only blew it on one count. Too bad that count was he didn't have the talent of Dylan's elbow. He tackles weighty topics - depression, suicide, drug addiction, apocalypse - but he doesn't say anything too revealing about any of them, and we wind up with several spare piano and acoustic guitar ballads that are lifeless and unoriginal, if earnest (""For Adam"", ""My Opening Farewell"", ""A Child in These Hills"", et al). But he doe nail a couple of these: ""Jamaica Say You Will"" is a lovely ballad that's been covered by just about everybody; the piano-driven, pessimistic ""Doctor My Eyes"" is probably my favorite of Jackson's songs, and actually is pretty good as far as Dylan knock-offs go; and ""Rock Me on the Water"" is enjoyably apocalyptic. Now if the rest weren't so turgid, we'd have a classic on our hands."
325812,B001F51VS4,Secret Clinical Strength (light and fresh scent),"I thought the deoderant was for a guy, but it isn't so I let my sister use the product and she relayed to me the following:""I don't understand why you need to apply this deodorant at night.  I generally do not perspire while I sleep and do not want to apply deodorant before bed time.  I have used Secret clinical strength in the mornings for  a week now and do not see any advantage to using it above the cheaper brands.  I do not perspire excessively and having a perfumed smell emitting from my arm pits is not something I want lingering in the air as I move about.  It bothers me that the manufacturer warns those that have  kidney disease to ask the doctor before using this product. It is very expensive, so unless you have a serious wetness and odor problem, I advise using the cheaper brands."""

I found the show enjoyable and yet some how over the top at the same time.Likes:Characters are great and many times your not really sure who is bad or good but you enjoy them all the same.Story line was great and I must admit the idea was one of the most original I have seen.Animation was colorful and vivid using light and dark to set the scene.The show while not reaching a final ending at least settled the main plot presented.Dislikes:I normally love fan service but this one was way over the top.  In several scenes rape or sex was greatly implied.Summary:For the price a great show and I have already purchased the dragon destiny.  I would recommend this one to people wanting hard core blood and fan service.  There is no way I am letting the kids any where near this one.  If you want loads of fan service with less bloody violence check out Girls Bravo or To Love ru.

1338708,B00007KQC1,I am SO disappointed!,"I bought this game thinking it would bear a slight resemblance to the other games in this series which I loved.  However, I found this game to be frustrating to the extreme.  I couldn't even get past the first mission due to the goofy save system which punished you every time you died.  The only way to save is to use a save token, which apparently appear randomly after defeating enemies. My brother-in-law had also bought it and hated it for this reason, and also because of the dragon meter feature.  Evidently, there is the ability for your main character to transform into a powerful dragon.  The only problem is, every time you do so, it adds to the dragon meter, which, once full changes your character into a dragon permanently, and then GAME OVER!  Why even put that stupid thing in there?  Why do game designers have to make saving such a chore?  I want to be able to save anywhere I please, at any time.  We aren't popping quarters into a machine, so what's the point!?I really wanted to like this game, and I believe it would have been really good if the save system were user friendly, and if they'd left out that ridiculous dragon meter.  I have never in my years of gaming (about 20) been this frustrated with and RPG, and that's my favorite game genre.So, in conclusion, unless you're a serious masochist, steer clear of this game!  Consider yourselves warned."
1521253,B00BGA9X9W,Didn't stand up to rough gameplay.,"Really, this is currently your only option for a PS4 controller, but it's good and effective. It's not perfect though, as I had to purchase a second controller due to the original one that came with the PS4 having sticky buttons.Is this the controllers fault? Not really. See, I picked up Gods Among us for the PS4, and I am apparently pretty rough on controllers when I play fighters, due to having to press multiple button combinations quickly. This caused the controllers L1 button to become sticky. Otherwise, it's a great controller that gets the job done.So, if you tend to be rough on controllers, I highly encourage you to pick up a spare."
3760236,B0087XOTWW,Nice RV replacement bulbs,Purchased 2 just to check them out.  I did have the RV on 110V power so I was giving the bulbs the full 13.56 volts and they stayed nice and bright.  They did get a little warm but no more than the incandesent bulbs.  I would recommend these for your RV using a fraction of the electrical power and actually seem to give more light output!!
1875923,B000O78LH8,Wonderfully Overdone,"From the moment I heard the first track on ""Release the Stars"" my first thought was that this album was going to be overly-dramatic, very operatic. My intial thoughts on this album was correct; but I don't mean this in a negative way, Rufus Wainwright is one of the few people that can pull it off wonderfully. My favorite songs are ""Do I Disappoint You"", ""Going to a Town"", ""Between My Legs"", ""Tiergarten"", ""Tulsa"", and ""Slideshow"" the latter of them in which is the most overally dramatic all. Overall I love this album and will be looking forward to reviewing some of his earlier works such as the Wants and Poses."

3702010,B004GF3XR2,I got a different rain coat than the one in the picture,"I got a generic looking rain coat that I could have gotten from a Petsmart or Petco.  I was expecting the one in the picture with the black and gray stripes and black piping.  Instead it was all yellow....  Maybe it was the XXL size but I felt it was a bit of a faulty advertisement.  Amazon to the rescue as they probably have one of the best customer services on this earth.  They were very quick to apologize as always and refunded me the money right away.  I hope the company reimburses amazon for these kind of mistakes but thanks to Amazon, I do a lot of my shopping here.If you are searching for XXL in this rain coat don't expect to see what is on the picture.  Oh on top of that the XXL was too small for my 83lbs dog.  She is very fit (not overweight) and it barely wrapped around the waist.  I had to sew and extension to the velcro.  Oh and I forgot to mention that the Velcro part has a reflector but the reflector was sewn inside out which meant that the reflection was against the skin and not facing outward."

1316079,B00004U1R1,"The best of the Zelda series, and one of the top of the N64!","Quite simply, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is the biggest eye-popping and engrossing game on the N64 to-date.  The graphics are sweet, and helped enormously with the help of the Expansion Pak, the story has to be the best in the series, and the play level is, for me, the best of practically any game I have ever played.  For the graphics, the Expansion Pak has given us a lush world with lots more evilies than the Ocarina of Time could ever do.  For the play level, even if you are living the same three days over and over again, its fun every time.  I played the game practically six hours straight and still never got tired of it, and this was two months after I bought the game and beaten it.  While the main adventure (defeating the four bosses in the four temples, and ultimately defeating the possessed Skull Kid) was not that hard to do, the side stories are numerous and fun to play, even if it is over and over again.  S. Miyamoto and his brillent staff at Nintendo of Japan did a wonderful job at bringing in bits and pieces that make the game even more interesting.  Among these is that you can check in-to Clock Town's Stock Pot Inn (which I think is very cool), help the innkeeper find her fiance, and there is much, much more.  What else can I say, but this game rocks, and is a must for any N64!"
1817514,B00DJPMBUU,Bright and uniform illumination,"LED technology in an affordable alternative to the old twin bulb floodlight we had mounted.  With its bright 1980 Lumens and uniform illumination they are perfect driveways, back yards, entrance doors, pool areas and walkways.  They Provide perfect lighting for safety and security reasons - residential or commercial use.  Unlike the old conventional floodlights that you had to replace the bulbs every year or so, these are made to last 32 years or 35,000 hours!Offers 180 degree motion sensor range and up to 70' away.  Has adjustable swivel head and sensor. You can select to have the lights on from 1 to 12 minutes.  Photocell ensures light is activated only when it senses motion at night time.  Also has a manual override feature in case you want to use the light as a floodlight for up to 6 hours.Since we replaced our old conventional bulb floodlight with this one, installation was quick and painless.  I also like the fact that it is not a real flying bug ""magnet"".Made of a die-cast heavy aluminum shell.  It is NOT Energy Star efficient, but at least it only turns on when it needs to, unlike floodlights which are a waste of electricity.Comes with a two-year warranty."
1413649,B001B0BB4W,A Game That Should NOT Have Been Released,"NHL 2K9 should have never been released to the public. Instead, Take Two/Visual Concepts should have taken the year off and continued to build and polish the game. All the depth and what was good about 2K8 has been stripped away in place of a shallow game, with simpler controls, but less responsive. Not to mention player models that look ridiculous. The AI is similar to 2K8's, with the exception of the goalies which are far worse than 2K8's. Even for the price, this game is NOT worth it. Go with 2K8 or even 2K10."

This bracket holds the NS micro tuner, of which I have 3.  I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications.  However, now, this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need.  A simple modification, but bordering on genius.

To top it off, the thing is flimsy, way to time consuming and the letters fall out from the frame while in the middle of routing.  JUNK.

Overall - I'm very pleased with this pick.Previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the National mediums.  This is true, but isn't a complete description.  Basically, the National picks are much more elongated - so while the nail to thumb-pad distance is about the same on both, the across nail distance is much greater on the National picks.  I actually find the Dunlop pick to fit much better, and I don't get extra overhang as with the National (which tends to catch the string)."

However almost all of the time it's fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing. I try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it's the same. It also did not come with batteries, and replacement ones aren't cheap and are very hard to find.

As much as I love & have waited for Eight Is Enough to get released to DVD, I'm on the fence on buying this series' sets as not only is the cost exorbitant, but it stands to reason DVD-R format doesn't have the durability as standard DVD format.There is no reason in the world why Eight Is Enough can't have a DVD Video release like a legion of other much-loved classics have had over the years & with much success I might add.

1342229,B000090W86,The Game Boy without the Batteries,"OVERVIEW:The Game Boy player was no doubt intended to draw the masses to the waining Gamecube. The strategy was in how to use the popularity of the GBA handheld, to get consumers to also consider the Gamecube console. Nintendo actually had created a Super Game boy device for the Super Nintendo some years ago. So this is nothing original however, but is vastly improved upon from the previous device. Technically the Game Boy player is a literal Game Boy Advance system without the ability to load GBA carts on it's own. It has been manufactured to match the measurements of the Nintendo Gamecube exactly and is equipable to the Nintendo Gamecube's high speed port located directly below the machine. 4 bolts can be fastened down with a coin to secure the Game Boy player. The device adds just 1 inch in height to the Gamecube and is programmed to accept all regional Gameboy Advance games as well as most Game Boy color and original Game Boy games just like the original Game boy Advance handheld. This gives gamers greater than 1,000 options making it a very large library of games to play with. No batteries are required since the Game Boy player powers off of the Gamecube anyway meaning it becomes more cost efficient than the handhelds were. The Game Boy player accepts Game Boy cartridges near the bottom and has a sliding ejection switch located on the right side of the player, used for popping game carts out when desired. The player itself requires a boot disc found packaged with the device in it's own protective hard case. The disc is exactly the same size as a common Gamecube disc, (3 inches in diameter) and must be placed in the Gamecube along with the GBA cart being placed in the player, before powering on the system. Once on, the disc can be removed at will without the need for disrupting gameplay. In fact, players can opt to load a Gamecube disc into the Gamecube during gameplay, shut down the Gameboy player via a menu, and load up the gamecube disc all without ever actually turning off the console itself. The same action can be applied when gamers decide to play a different Game Boy game pak. So no need to reboot a second time unless you shut the system down. The Gameboy Player was designed to behave in most every way like an actual Game Boy Advance unit. It supports most Game Boy Advance accessories like the Nintendo E-Reader device which is used to scan cards. It can accept the Game Boy Advance Game link cable for multiplayer purposes though a second Game Boy Advance will still be required. You may access the cable link port right in the front of the Game Boy player device. Simply plug the game link cable to the Game Boy player port, then plug the other end of the cable right into a Game Boy Advance unit. Check your manuals for GBA titles that may require more than one game pak as well before attempting this of course! Actually the Game Boy player fully supports the Game Boy Advance wireless multiplayer adapter as well. Gamers can plug up a common Gamecube controller in port 1 or use the Game Boy Advance/Gamecube connectivity cable along with a Game Boy Advance or even a Gameboy Advance SP to serve as a controller. While the Gamecube controller is usable, the button layouts are unique given the complexity of the controller versus the simple button layout on the Game Boy units. Both the Y and X buttons found on the Gamecube controller for example, are mapped to the select button on a Game Boy unit. A menu option will allow the player to choose between a few different button control layouts with the Gamecube controller, though I have found it best to leave it as is. You get used to it believe me. The Analog stick will function along side with the directional pad on a controller as a character movement tool. pretty cool stuff. The Game Boy player has an options menu accessable with the tap of the Z button at any time during game play. Be warned however as this function will not pause actual game play. From here players may choose new button control schemes, toggle between normal and full screen views, play with a screen filter for richer picture during on screen action segments, even set an in game timer of up to 60 minutes, choose from over 20 different wallpaper views in normal screen mode, and are able to quit the current game. The game screen itself is roughly half the size of the actual TV screen, and is presented in a centrally located box complete with a decorative wallpaper hanging over the background. players have over 20 wallpaper options to choose from but if the wallpapers aren't for you, you can always stretch the image to full screen via the Game Boy player menu options. You'll loose some clarity however and the images on screen become a bit blurry. They still look nice however and it probably won't bother people too much once you get used to it. There is a screen filter option offering three levels of filtering; sharp, normal, and low. This option set on sharp will keep images looking crisp and nice while players are moving around on screen or during chaotic action sequences where there may be quite a bit going on on screen. this comes at the cost of frame rate and in some cases can drastically slow the game down. Actually this will never happen much as most games never have these lag issues on the Game Boy Advance anyways. Some people may NEVER incure these problems so it's really no problem at all. The timer is there just for fun. You can set it to count how long your playing in some games or use it to have the children share time on it...just to name a few a suggestions. The Game Boy player unfortunately will not work with the Nintendo Wii as the Wii lacks the high speed port found at the foot of the Gamecube. Besides, the size and shape of the player in comparison to the Wii would be impractical. There are also some minor cases where certain Game paks are found to not work right in the Game Boy player. Namely it's the unique titles that require certain conditions for gameplay to work properly. Games like Yoshi Topsy Turvy required players to tilt the game left to right to have the character move on the screen. You probably won't be in the mood for hefting the entire Gamecbue left and right all day as this might get a bit heavy LOL!There is the Boktai series on GBA as well which required solar energy for certain gameplay settings, meaning you'll need sunlight. Also there are a few GBA game garts with a unique shape to them. Considering that game carts are loaded at the bottom of the player, this would mean that the Gamecube would have to sit on top of the game pak to work. In this instance however, if you simply tilt the Gamecube part ways over a table surface so that the cart can lean over a ledge, you might remedy that issue entirely. These rather bizarre incompatibility issues are few and really nothing to worry over as most Game Boy games are played in the conventional since. An issue involving Game Boy Advance movie series game carts is also present. For copyright purposes, Nintendo disabled the Game Boy players' ability to view these special cartoon shorts. They feared that people could somehow burn copies of the toons from thier TV's. Also incompatible with the Game Boy player is the Game Boy Micro hand held. you can't use the Micro as a controller because it's ports for cable connections have been reworked for the purpose of ""proprietary conversion"" to a consumer product. So the Micro cannot connect with the GBA/Gamecube cables. If you purchase the Micro/GBA conversion cord from Nintendo's web site, you could use the Game Boy Micro as a second player in multiplayer titles by hooking the micro conversion cord into the GBA game link cable, then plugging THAT into the Game Boy player device. Having said all that, The Game Boy player DOES offer a unique rumble pak like enhancement using the Gamecube controller in select titles like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga for example. Too bad only a hand full of games supported that feature though. The Game Boy player comes in jet black color only in the US. However, in Japan I here they had platinum, Indigo, and Spice colors to match the colored variety of Gamecubes respectively. (Japan has a Spice or yellow colored Gamecube also not found in the states) The Game Boy player was available for retail around 2003 and was priced at 50.00$ US currency. So if your looking into this item try and use this MSRP price as a basis to go on so you won't lose too much money on a bad deal... Game Boy player units have since been discontinued and are becoming increasingly harder to find as the years move along so I suggest quick action if the product really excites you.PROS:...Overall the Game Boy player really is a value and a pleasure to own and to play. The picture quality on your TV set looks very nice even at a seemingly disproportionate size. The ability to power itself off of the Gamecube means zero batteries. And that means this becomes very cost efficient if your still running your original Game Boy Advance unit. There are more options available to the gamer in regards to controller use with the Gamecube controller offering one more way to play your games. The ability to see everything without having to squint is obviously a welcome addition. Espescially true for text heavy titles like Final Fantasy and when it comes to people that have troubles seeing small text. I liked the way the Game Boy player allows you to switch between game carts and even into using the Gamecube on the fly a bit more easier than powering down the hand held all the time. Volume works on the TV speakers now rather than those tiny little things you spot on the GBA device too.CONS:It limits use of some unique games due to the shape of the cart or certain gameplay factors like requiring solar energy or motion sensitive titles. Some games really look terrible on your TV and it's not the Game Boy player's fault! The programmers sometimes don't pay attention to detail work and boy does it ever show up on a TV set! Game Boy Advance sound is enhanced on the TV because of the speakers. But it's overall quality is lackluster in many titles. This is apparently true on older Game Boy or Game Boy clor titles where all those bleeps and blurbs will drive you batty. Some folk will find it annoying to say the least. Game Boy movie carts are a no no on the device due to fear of some happy hacking rascals out there. [RANT ON] Really, who the heck wants to steal RUGRATS or FAIRLY ODD PARENTS cartoons? And don't they understand hackers are likely going to just rip off DVD versions anyways? HERE'S YOUR SIGN! [RANT OFF]OVERALL:Realistically this product is worth the price of admission. It retailed cheaper than a Game Boy unit and yet functions just as well as one in most respects. It's hard to knock this stellar product even if it were Nintendo's way of wanting you to maybe think about it's Gamecube too in that cheesy little way. A word to the wise... this device works best on 32 inch TV's or below. Anything bigger and the picture gets a little uglier than some may be able to deal with. It never gets too bad though. It's easy to afford, install, and use. If you own a Gamecube that your shelfing due to the Wii console here's one good reason to shine up the cube and keep it around a bit longer. Even if you own multiple game boy units or the DS, The Game Boy player still holds it's own as a unique experience. And I doubt the Wii will ever recreate another similar device. All said and done I have to recommend this device, it's really worth it."

1491589,B0050SZBP6,I don't understand why.,"Why does WoW still have over 10 million subs. The challenge is gone. This is a casual game now. It isn't a game for gamers. What I mean is I can remember back in Vanilla WoW when people helped others. When it mattered what guild you were in. You even had to actually be a skilled player to do your job.None of that matters anymore. Most all guilds are 10-man. That was a horrible mistake. No battle feels epic with just 10 people. The removal of real skill points and talent trees. Just dumbed things down for both the player and them.My favorite time in WoW was during BC. WoW has gone downhill since then with each expansion. I thought the end of Cata was bad. MoP has brought WoW to a new all time low. I paid for this game for almost 8 years. Quit in October once my Annual Pass was up. I shouldn't have been able to just up and leave like I did. Blizzard let me leave people I have gamed with for years and not think twice about it.They ruined the game so much even today I still have no want to play. I honestly stopped here to see if the price of the expansion went way down or not. Can't believe it hasn't but I guess when the player base has changed so much to include so many, rude, childish, and ignorant people. Blizzard has people willing to pay no matter how bad the product is. I mean look at how bad Diablo 3 is.So WoW went from a game I couldn't get enough of to a game that felt like a job. If you haven't bought MoP yet I recommend you don't and just move on to the next better game. While they don't have the population WOW does. They also don't have the poor quality player base. People not willing to even give you directions or answer a simple question.The MMO is gone from WoW. It really is just a single player game now with optional multiplayer. So get out now while you still can. The people who worked for Blizzard and made the old games good are gone now. This new generation they got making games and choices is doing a horrible job. Even they don't want a challenge. Again the new skill trees that really are not skill trees made the game 100 times easier for them to balance. That is all it was.Things made simple in MoP ruined the last little bit of challenge WoW offered. Flying mounts and 10 man raiding ruined the rest of it. WoW is done. Nothing left to see here. Please move on and don't waste your money. Speak with your wallet. We need to tell Blizzard we will no longer buy crap just because it is made by Blizzard.Blizzard once said something. It was a level of quality. It said good game to me and many people. It doesn't any longer. It says you bought the last one so you will buy this one also. It doesn't have to be great. You will still pay. You all know this to be true.Truth be told I do miss the people I played with. Not reason enough to support a company that has stopped trying."

774688,B007HEQIMQ,Ominous agreement to open the app,"My trust in recent years of credit cards and banks has about hit zero with so many of them finding so many ways to niggle money from the unwary customer. Trust has turned out to be unwarranted when it comes to institutions handling my money. When the first thing I have to do to use an app is sign off on some EULA which looks like I'm signing off on my first born, I say no nowadays. So I haven't bothered to use this. Maybe its wonderful, but now I'll never know. BOA make your EULA less threatening! Maybe it would be nice if a user could at least look at the app before they had to agree to be bound by the banks 'conditions'. After looking at the app and deciding I don't want the conditions in exchange for the app, will I then be 'unbound'? Does Rumpelstiltskin give your child back?"

First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless, no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite."

1676944,B00BIEU71E,"Excellent Taste and Aroma; Smooth; Strong, but Not Bitter","This is a new brand for me. The first thing I noticed was the very nice aroma. The coffee is a strong, but not too bitter, European-style dark coffee. French roast can sometimes be a little too strong for breakfast, but this blend is appropriate for just about any time. I recommend it if you like strong coffee without the bitter taste that come strong coffees have. It has a hint of sweetness to it, a nice touch, but not enough to spoil it for those of us who don't like anything sweet in our coffee."

After the initial heat-up, stir thoroughly and Microwave for an addt'l 5 mins @ 20% power, yes that is twenty percent power. This helps to thicken it up, soften any noodles and meld the flavours a lot more.I prefer my Split Pea kind of chunky so I found adding 2 heaping T ofQuaker Oats Old Fashioned Oatmeal, 18-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)helps a lot without adding too many calories plus more fiber to the 9 grams already in this soup.Hope that helps ya'all"
463299,B0070ZXJGK,Are you kidding me?,"While I have about 6 different CPAP tubes, ranging from thin, thick, short, long and stiff. I am using the same original high quality tube I got almost 5 years ago with my Resmed 8. The other tubes are inferior and I am fortunate I don't need them yet. I have never used a brush and I have always had a humidifier. I get a call once a month for face cushions, tubes and filters and decline them all except the cushions, though insurance covers most of the cost of all. I use four cushions at a time and rotate them every two or three nights. Not knowing any better, I used my original cushion for two years and it worked fine. It yellowed, but always worked like new. Twice a month I clean out the sink, fill it with hot water, add Dawn or Palmolive and two to three tablespoons of Clorox. I throw in the tubing, face mask, cushions humidifier and any silicone and plastic pieces and let it sit for an hour or so. I then rinse everything, set it on a clean towel and let it dry. After flushing the tube, I grab it in the center, spin it to remove excess water and hang it over a door. If I go an extra night or two or three I use the CPAP wipes and spray on the cushion. In 5 years I have had no issues with mold anywhere nor facial irritation. There is one exception, at the very bottom of the water tank/humidifier I do get a small amount of slimy buildup and is why I wash it at almost every refill. I do clean the humidifier container with soap at least once a week. I fill the tank and rinse all in RO water when I am done washing. I question technicians and/or doctors when they suggest I should not use bleach and should use the expensive solutions for disinfection. Going by experience, many items are gimmicks of sorts or pushed by the medical establishment for profit. I would consider this brush one of those gimmicks, unless of course, you clean your stuff a few times a year, then by all means, buy this brush."
2876174,B000FGGE5Y,So bad it was almost good,"This movie uses every cliched idea ever about a female action hero who is out for justice.  Why is she so pissed off? She got a disease that turned her into a hemophage (aka not human) and the government killed her baby. What's she going to do about it? Kill all humans.  How? By strutting around in midriff-baring spandex and wielding guns and knives while never breaking a sweat or messing up her hair.It's almost ridiculous how bad this movie is, to the point where it was almost good because I wouldn't have thought you could shove so much garbage into an hour and a half.  Boy was I wrong! Catwoman, Queen of the Damned... not even close. This movie looks like a video game half the time and has so many pauses for effect, I think there's more silence than sound (music not included). And then there's the snappy dialogue.  I mean, with lines like ""Killing is what I do. It's what I'm good at,"" and ""You got hemo blood on me. It is on,"" how could this not be the gem of contemporary vampire cinema.  If you're in the mood for a laugh, you should rent this movie. But if you're in the mood for a decent action movie, look elsewhere."

Well, it doesn't.  It's SO sweet... for two tablespoons, there is a whopping 21 grams of sugar, and 23 grams of carbohydrates!  I could barely taste any almond flavor.  Sugar is listed as the first ingredient, and it all goes downhill from there.  Hershey can make delicious chocolate products, and I was hoping this would be one of them, but it was so sweet, I could barely eat it.  Sorry, Hershey, but you dropped the ball (and the almonds) on this one."

1675937,B00B9AAI9S,Normally I Love Numi Organic...,"I actually feel guilty for giving this product such a low rating because it has the potential to be great.  I love a lot of Numi's organic teas & even subscribe & save to many of them.  The ingredients in the Garden Pack are 100% great, no natural flavors or other garbage.  The tea bags themselves are GMO free.  Even the idea behind the tea is a fabulous one!  I was so thrilled at the opportunity to try them!Unfortunately I just don't like the taste.  It is as simple as that.  If I want something hot with veggies, I'll have soup.  Soup is much more flavorful & to state the obvious - filling.  Or if I want something cold with veggies, I'll just juice 'em - again more flavorful & filling.  Numi's Savory Teas are watery & bland.  This is using one tea bag in a 6 ounce cup.  The average coffee/tea mug these days is 10 ounces so I can only imagine how much more watery the tea must turn out if you use the larger sized mug.  When I brewed my teas, I left the tea bag in the entire time.  The only time I really got any decent flavor was in the last 2 sips where the soggy tea bag sat.I am a Pu-erh tea addict & will happily stick to drinking it.  It is with much disappointment that I give such a great idea with high quality ingredients 2 stars."

2468182,B00005IB99,A Contender,"Of the 4 already posted reviews of this Turandot, two are largely screeds against Kultur and one is a defense written by a Kultur executive.  Only one reviewer focused on the production, and he gave it high marks.  I agree with that review.  I am a great fan of Turandot, but to be frank, most of my joy comes from having my ears blown off by a dramatic soprano and a tenore robusto butting heads like raging bulls.  By that criterion this production is 2/3 home -- Voss sang the role very well with great reserves of power and was usually spot on; Collins, however, was not quite Turandot's equal (few tenors are).  He was able to hold his own for the final grueling duet and handled most of his other chores well.  However, the 3rd act aria (you know the one) was underpowered, so no World Cup contract for him.  Thane (Liu) was first class.  The rest of the cast was adequate or better.  Acting was minimal, but Turandot is hardly an actor's opera; given the stilted characters and their meager development (other than the miraculous transformation of Turandot which is so unbelievable it's no wonder poor Puccini didn't finish it before his death), Turandot has always struck me as a stand and sing opera that is plumped up with eye candy (elaborate sets and legions of extras).  This production is in that vein.  It boasts a traditional staging that is less sumptuous than the Met production (not necessarily a bad thing) but nevertheless does not skimp on costumes (no everyone is not in white as one reviewer suggested) and colorful props.  The executioner, in particular, is a memorable and menacing character.  As for the Kultur packaging, the English subtitles are constantly on and the picture may not be as crisp as many in our HD era would like, but the color is good, everything is in focus, and the camera's attention is where it should be."

1722087,B000CC2KP4,Worked fine for a while - then Dismally Failed,"When I first got my Stanley Tripod flashlight, I absolutely adored it. There are so many situations where I need a flashlight but need both of my hands to work on something. This was ideal. Simply set up the tripod, turn the head of the flashlight, and you're set. You could plunk it anywhere.During those first months, my only complaint was that it takes NINE batteries, three per leg. That seems extreme for a modern flashlight.Then, after a few months, the connection in the &#34;swivel head&#34; began to get iffy. The light would flicker. I tried new batteries, more new batteries, leaving the head straight, and it didn't matter. The flickering continued.Now I'm at the point where the flashlight will stay on for a short while then go OUT. Talk about incredibly annoying when you're trying to work on something! And it'd be even worse if there was an actual emergency where it was pitch black out.There's no reason to have a flashlight that will randomly turn off. Not only is it annoying but it could be an immense safety hazard. I'm not even sure I can give this away to anybody. Who would I want to subject to such a dangerous item? What if THEY were going down stairs or something with it and it suddenly went out?There are other alternatives on the market to this. I'd go with an alternative."
1302146,B003W47NII,"Meh. If you can, spring for the iRigHD","This is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iPhone or iPad. But if you want to use it for any recording at all, even demos, I strongly recommend going for the iRigHD. The HD sounds waaaaaay better, and the build quality is great. This guy, not so much. There was always a bit of noise with my old iRig, and it seemed to get worse over time. It also felt kinda fragile and chinsy. If you look, you can usually find the HD somewhere for $80; a $50 difference is significant, but the jump in quality (and likely longevity of the product) is definitely worth it. I upgraded and would absolutely do it again."
3436614,B008CP2E7C,fear your ears,"First of all, the music is so laughably bad that it makes this film seem more like a mockumentary.  This is only partially Rodriguez's fault, since judging from the tracks included, those first two albums were horribly produced, taking a semi-interesting folk singer/acoustic guitarist and larding up his music with sappy strings and other ill-chosen instrumentation (think of the worst of Nick Drake, but even that is much better).  As a film, it's so-so, hitting very familiar notes.  Mostly this just made me lose whatever respect I might have had for South African musical tastes. It's a Bizarro world to be sure.  There's a reason why Rodriguez didn't sell in the U.S."

1340365,B00008DHNL,"Car, Guns, and Violence","This game can be comparred GTA: Vice City but no helicopters or motorcycles and the music could be better. But the storyline makes up for it the classic cop seeking the truth to what happened to his father. The guns also are good the upgrade are ok and the fighting is fine. But one draw back is when you are fighting a major boss you cannot use your guns. The best part is you cannot die. But if you are looking for a replacement For GTA this is not your game. If you want a roaming game or just a way to releive tyou stress (go on a killing spree) this is your game.

985694,B00A09W7R0,City of Cold,"Let me start with the positive. The graphics are excellent, the motion of the spinning slots are among the best I have seen in a game of slots. The Scatter games are fun and innovative with top notch motion and effect.  Winning odds are good for a slot game.Now the problem with this game is that for a paid game (at $1.99) you only get one machine, there are no other machines to speak of and I could not find a way to tweak settings, like no sound. The game does not keep a tab on how much you have left in the Bank. If you CASH OUT, the game doesn't tell you how much you have left.I expected more of a paid game an it's a shame because this game could have been awesome if it include more machines."

1298570,B000JRPYGE,Awesome hobbyist mic.,"I am not a studio engineer, nor am I a professional musician.  I record songs in my home as a hobby.  I like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting, so if you're at or around the same level, you know what I'm talking about.  Will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much?  No.  Are you likely to find it in a high-end professional studio?  Eh...probably not.  Is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point?  Hells yes.I've worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious, and this is the nicest mic I own right now.  The difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious.  I use it for recording vocals, and my voice (again, not a pro!) is finicky to record, usually sounding pretty muddy.  Even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals (SM57 and 58) this was still the case.  But with this mic, my voice sounds much more clear and open.Admittedly, this is a very subjective evaluation, but then aren't all mic evaluations subjective?  You can go on all day about response range and EQ flatness, but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application.  And to my ears, this mic sounds wonderful.My only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn't seem to be a super-tight cardioid, because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it.  Perhaps this is how it's supposed to be, but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously, it can be a headache trying to jury-rig an isolation method that works.  I took off a star for this alone, although that may not be fair since I haven't used any other large-diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they're all supposed to behave this way."

We got this for him when he was about 4 months old and he showed no interest in it. He much preferred the Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Wolf instead. This was simply too big for him and he preferred other chew toys that fit his smaller jaws better.He's now 7 months old and he's grown to the point where he LOVES this Nylabone. It's super hard so it'll last a very long time for even the most aggressive chewer. As with any hard plastic chew you need to supervise: throw it out before it gets too small."
1307446,B00001OWYW,Best of the series.,"This game, without a doubt, is by far the best game in the Castlevania series. Even if you previously havent played any of the other games it's still worth it. There's not much else to say besides it's a classic 2d game and perfectly dark. Alucard is a great main character....but that's not just the reason it's so good. Everything about it is great...from the 2d landscapes and backrounds...to the vast selection of weaponry and armor...and relics...all the way to the voiceovers. There are also tons of secret corridors that will take an eternity to find. Whether you like classic games or not you will probably like this...Forget those lamo N64 Castlevanias...this is where it's at..."
258902,B000K2X8UW,Good for some added knee support,"I put this one when I know I'm going to be up and down the ladder a lot at work or going to be crouching down. Does get a little annoying if wearing for very long periods of time as it will dig into the back of your knee. The size fits me good, but I was adjusting it sometimes throughout the day as the top would slide down."
3638308,B000OPBGJU,Prevents blown pads,"I have a sight hound that I take lure coursing and racing.  I bought this product to use as a preventative measure for when he is running on dry fields that might cause him to blow a paw pad.  He hasn't blown one before but I want to be proactive about preventing injuries if possible.  With that being said I can't really say if this product has actually helped prevent them or not, but I can say a few good things about it.... It's in a great little container, it's the perfect shape, you just take a paw and dab it on the product.  It's small and light weight so it's convenient to pack, but at the same time it seems like it's a lot of product and should last a long time even if you used it daily.  Also as far as I can tell, it doesn't stain surfaces and it doesn't smell like anything.  My dog hasn't ever noticed when it's on him either, doesn't try to lick it off or anything."

I could hear the motor run but the bit barely turned.  What I discovered was the plastic gears that transfer power from the motor to the chuck had disintegrated.I replaced it with aBosch 36618-02 18-Volt 1/2-Inch Compact-Tough Litheon Drill/Driver.  It is a bit more expensive but hasn't broken down and is better balanced than the Hitachi.  (I could have saved a bit by not buying the Hitachi first...)"
3259934,B003Y5H5C4,Needs a Better Script,"[THE REVIEW INCLUDES MILD SPOILERS]Two delinquents Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) want Dwayne's rich and domineering father (Fred Ward) dead. So, what should they do? Hire a hitman, of course. But they need money to hire one. OK, make a bomb, strap it to a pizza delivery driver Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and makes him rob a bank.The story of ""30: Minutes or Less"" starts off pretty well, but for all the talented cast involved (with Aziz Ansari as Chet, Nick's best friend), the film soon loses momentum, not knowing what it really wants to do. Even at 83 minutes (with a post-credit scene) the action/thriller/comedy feels very long.""30: Minutes or Less"" stars Jesse Eisenberg and is directed by Ruben Fleischer. They are also the star and the director of a more effective comedy ""Zombieland."" Eisenberg, whose character in ""Zombieland"" was much more interesting, does his best here, but in the end most scenes are stolen by Danny McBride and Nick Swardson in ""30: Minutes or Less.""That leaves the viewer with no one to root for. No matter how desperate Nick and Chet may become, we simply do not really care. ""30: Minutes or Less"" is sporadically funny thanks to the cast, but in spite of some good ingredients, the film suffers from the half-baked writing."

297366,B0013OVGAK,Didn't Revitalize Me or Help Me to Sleep,"Since I suffer from being tired all the time, I've read a lot of books on sleep, chronic fatigue, etc.  One of the most comprehensive of these books is ""From Fatigued to Fantastic,"" by Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum.  What he says seems to make a lot of sense.I researched all of the ingredients that people seemed to be saying were natural, over the counter products that helped people get to sleep and get deeper and better sleep.  After having done this, I discovered that this ""Revitalizing Sleep Formula"" had more of these ingredients than most other products: valerian, passionflower, L-theanine, and hops.Unfortunately, after having taken ""Revitalizing Sleep Formula"" for a month, I've found that it doesn't really help me get to sleep.  Also, I don't seem to be getting any better sleep.  I was hoping that this formula would work as well as prescription sleep-aid products, but I've been disappointed.It may work for some, but it hasn't for me."
135279,B00A06YQ86,Good case for hardcore protection!,"If you're looking for a case that is similar to the Ballistic SG series, then you can't beat this one for the time being. It is an excellent product for the price. However, that being said, the quality does suffer a bit as a result. The rubber portion has some unsightly ridges sticking out, and the cutouts do look a bit tacky. The plastic shell is not as thick as a Ballistic case, but I think the protection offered is still more than adequate. I personally don't like the polka-dot design and wish the logo wasn't on the back, but that's about it when it comes to gripes. This is simply one of the most durable cases you can get for the Nexus 4 at the moment. I wouldn't hesitate to get it if you're looking for some extra protection."
1662959,B007N04AF6,Great!,"The price is way too high at the grocery store, but for a pack of 12 it's about 80 cents. Still a bit high, but this made me feel full, and it tasted great. It also does not raise my blood sugar to great heights."
664766,B005ZISF8Q,like the magazine better,"Cancelled this one after the first issue. Felt like it was difficult to navigate, could not get some of the features to work and it seemed to be more about advertisement than articles.

1621030,B003QTZ2RS,Nothing Sweet About This Tea,"This tea is not sweet, at all. It's got a terrible aftertaste. I make it with lots of sugar, just like a would Lipton Tea. I won't be buying this again."
3636001,B000MD58MA,Nice,"I bought this first of all because I have black interior and a white dog and that never is a good combination. But whenever I put a blanket or something over the seat it ends up in a bunch on the floor because my dog moves around too much. So this is good because it sort of secures in place. One of the bad things is that it's just a little too big for my car (subaru impreza 5-door), and it also doesn't block her from coming in the front seat. She just walked right over the barrier. So instead of having it clipped to the front seat headrests I just have it going down to cover the floor and use her regular seat belt to keep her in the back seat. Also...it came with part of the seam already ripped out by the seat belt holder. I think I'm going to end up putting a blanket on top of this cover just because the material is kind of stiff my dog feels uncomfortable laying on it.Overall, very good for the price. I can't seem to find these anywhere for less than 35$ and this saved me the trouble of having to make one myself. If you already strap your dog to the seat belt somehow this would be perfect, and if your dog isn't that rough."
1774900,B002XXIZOU,"sturdy, good-fit","Sturdy gloves with a good fit, I use these for household tasks dealing with chemicals or auto repair.They're much sturdier than either the low-end latex or the medical-style blue nitrile gloves I've used before. I haven't had any tearing or seeping incidents. There's little to no residual odor after wearing them (and no powder). Dexterity isn't impaired at all and I haven't dropped anything because I was wearing them.The ""Large"" fits perfectly on my slenderish average-sized male hands (8"" from wrist-crease to tip of middle finger). The glove doesn't extend much past that wrist-crease. Definitely not ""one-size"", on my GF's small hands, I found I could grab a fingertip and yank the Large glove off her hand without any effort-- you'll need to buy multiple sizes of these if you have users with different-sized hands.I was looking for something both tough and latex-free, at a good price. At half the price of buying gloves locally, this box of 100 is doing the trick. Recommended."
1760222,B001HSO6VI,These are great clamps!,"I'm not sure that I have actually used these clamps as they are intended to be used, but I have found many purposes from them. I like that they don't apply any &#34;circular&#34; pressure while tightening. The pressure comes straight in, so your work will tend not to slip."
1320074,B000056SNY,Not what you expected ......,"You know this company makes RPG games, so if thats what you want get a Final Fantasy or something. But if you are like me and want a break from the usual get this game as it is a beat em up style game that seems to be lacking after the PSX era of time. And if you think final fight street wise may be a good idea steer clear of that heap of garbage and get this game instead. This has the good but kind of blurry graphics that were awesome at the time and the CG cutscenes are still very impressive to this day. The downfall in my opinion is the cheap fighting people can do in this game it is BROKEN. Kou can do consecutive uppercuts if you time them right, and the first form of duragon has a knee combo if done right you will kill the guard and your foe to easily. Get all the characters and play the game to see for yourself that it is a good change for a while, and then you see how much BS can actually be found in the fighting engine. If you are the throw the controller type do NOT get this game."

2165735,6301967860,Stinker,"I hate to use that word when referring to the Brothers but this movie was dull and uneventful.  It's was like no one took the time to write a few scenes/sketches in the classic Marx style that we know and love.  The big chase at the end seemed to belong more in a Buster Keaton silent flick and was really not the Mark Brothers style AT ALL.  Not as disgusting an effort as AT THE CIRCUS, but this runs a close second as the worst Marx film of them all. (I have yet to see Room Service) Not terrible, just uneventful. Rent before you buy."

1480136,B004QEWVLC,Now with more tasteless humor and fun!,"Saints Row has always been about crazy. The third installment raises it to levels previously unknown to man. It's just fun, fun, fun! Recklessly driving vehicles, throwing down wrestling moves, blowing things up...over and over again. I've played for a couple of hours and it's what i remember from SR2, but with more options and craziness."
1354478,B0002RQ3ES,The Camera ruins the experience...and some other things.,"I am never this picky about my games.  If its fun, I like it.  But in this case, the camera ruined parts of the game for me.Before I make a list of complaints, let me first praise the game on its finer qualities.  I have never before played a game in which I got so involved.  I would obsess over stealth.  In some instances when I was playing cat and mouse with enemy guards hidden in the woods, I would sit for ten or fifteen minutes try to find them.  I found great joy sneaking up on unsuspecting victims and interrogating them or slitting their throat on a whim.  I would watch with amused fascination I shot a guards flamethrower and see him explode into a firey ball.  I would blend seamlessly into my surroundings and dissappear.  In one level, I was completely surrounded by snipers, with no idea where they were, until, after I few minutes of looking through my own scope, saw the glint of the sun off one of the snipers scope.  Priceless.Dispite all this, the camera angles were god-awful.  Too many times I would realize the guard I was stalking was RIGHT in front of me because the camera wouldn't show where he was.  I really cannot discribe how bad it was.Another thing that irked me slightly was the ability for your character to heal himself.  Its a cool concept, but the way it was done took away from the game.  You can perform surgery on yourself right in the middle of battle, which I thought was rediculous.  And say you had been shot five times, you would only have to remove about two bullets.  Minor details, I know, but I thought it was stupid.The most dissappointing thing in the game was the bosses.  I HATED THE BOSSES.  This game would have been SOOOO much better without them.  They were too comic-bookish.  The game faces you off against a angry hornet throwing guy, an invisible guy, a guy in a wheelchair, a guy who sends ghosts to get you, and an astronaut(?) with a jet pack and flamethrower.  I hated the bosses.All in all, the game is great...If you can deal with bad camera angles and stupid bosses.  It's a great buy."
2648625,B0000ADXFV,"""The Sensorites... they're near us now!""","This 6-part story is a great oldie and classic. I got this one in the ""End of the Universe"" collection and I found it quite enjoyable. I'm surprised that it hasn't been released on DVD yet.Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first. Episode 3 was kind of boring, but it picks up again in episode 4. There are many stuttered lines in this story. The Sensorites feet look ridiculous. And at one point, you even see a wall in the spaceship start to fall down before it is quickly put back up again. But other than that, this is a great story.The acting was pretty good - some of it was actually brilliant. The sets look great. The dark spaceship was very spooky as well as the aqueduct on the Sense-Sphere. The Sensorites were very creepy in the first two episodes. Episode 1's cliffhanger was, in my opinion, one of the best in the series. The plot and the story were great. It has a lot of mystery in it. It has a great surprise ending, and I really enjoyed Susan's character a lot more in this story than in others. Her character should have been like this from the beginning. This is also the very first story that has the Doctor himself taking on the heroic role instead of Ian, and he uses his mind and wits to defeat the enemy instead of brute force. I really enjoyed this one and I'm sure you will as well. Highly recommended!"
1697962,B00004YKUO,Great Machine!,"I owned a DeWalt biscuit joiner for a few years.  That was a great machine.  When the time came to sell the DeWalt and get a new one, I decided to buy the Porter+Cable 557.  After using it several times, I can safely say that it was a very good decision.GENERAL PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS:Even more than the DeWalt, the Porter+Cable is a really well-built machine.  It feels strong and solid in your hands.  When you place it on a surface, it gives an impression of being nicely centered.The large handle at the front of the machine is in just the right spot, giving you a good firm grip on the machine when you plunge into the wood.  Grabbing this handle and pushing down sets the unit right where it needs to be on the work surface and against the wood that will receive the biscuit.  Nice engineering!The fence is well made with an easy-to-read degree scale and metal parts.  Some of the other cheaper units on the market have more plastic.The base of the unit is perfectly flat.The carrying case that comes with this unit is sturdy and useful, and the machine sets down securely inside.USAGE:The biscuit-size-selection knob is easy to read, with large white numbers.  It clicks firmly into place.  This unit can do all the common sizes (0, 10, 20) as well as the face-frame (ff) setting for cabinet work.  Not all biscuit joiners have the ff setting.The centering mark is a red line, easy to read while looking down from the top of the machine.  It is very simple to line up the centering mark with your biscuit centers.  When plunging, the non-skid surface does a good job of preventing the unit from shifting.  However, I suggest putting your wood against a firm backing or clamping it down to the work surface so you can apply full pressure when plunging.  I would not suggest holding your work down with your hands.  Some people do this, and it is a bad idea.The motor is powerful, and the included blade is good quality.  I've put biscuits in hard maple, ash, oak, cherry, as well as poplar and pine.  This machine never hesitates, plunging easily and smoothly.  There is a trigger to turn the machine on and off, or you can set the unit to run continuously, which is helpful when cutting a series of slots.The fence adjusts easily for times when you want to put a biscuit in a miter joint or other angled surface.  I hardly use this function -- most of my biscuit joints are at 90 degrees.DUST COLLECTION:The 557 has great dust collection.  When hooked up to a vacuum or dust collector, at least 90% of the dust is picked up.  This was a pleasant surprise for me.  The dust collection hose is located in a convenient spot, tailing off the back of the machine and at an angle so it is not in the way during operation.  I strongly suggest using dust collection.  If dust isn't picked up, your machine eventually doesn't sit flush on the work surface and you have to keep stopping to vacuum up.  But if you have the machine hooked up to a dust collector, you can zoom from one cut to the next without stopping.In addition to working better, dust collection is very important for your health -- you don't want to breathe in that dust!CONCLUSION:If you use biscuits in your woodworking and you are looking for a well-made machine, this one is great.  It offers all the features you need for easy biscuit operation, with great dust collection."

1872406,B000BGR0OM,Not ultimate at all,"Eurythmics made some of the greatest sounds of the 1980 in many genres, not just the standard synth-pop. Lennox & Stuart also made a major contribution in the forgotten bandThe Touristsbefore the birth of Eurythmics. Unfortunately this album contains too many tracks already available onGreatest Hits.Some less inspired songs from the 1990s have been added. This really shows a lack of interest and imagination in view of the huge treasure trove of classic album tracks. The compilers could have chosen The Last Time fromRevenge, Jennifer fromSweet Dreams, Shame & Beethoven (I Love to Listen to) fromSavage, When the Day Comes Down fromWe Too Are Oneand Belinda & She's Invisible Now from the obscure first albumIn the Garden.But for those who never got round to Greatest Hits, it's a worthwhile purchase. Every rhythm they took, they made their own: consider the catchy calypso of Right By Your Side, grand rock ballads like Thorn In My Side and When Tomorrow Comes or the perfect pop of Love is a Stranger. Their emotional range is unique: the chilling menace of You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart makes a stark contrast to the joyful exuberance of There Must Be An Angel or the powerful affirmative Sisters Are Doing it for Themselves."

Both those companies will fight for you if a problem arises, and in most cases will refund your money anytime within the warranty period. **For right now, very happy with it, and hope I stay that way.  I can see why alot of people buy, and use this mouse, it is really nice.Lastly - I really like the weights included - very nice weight with them all loaded.UPDATE 1: Been using for a few weeks now - between 4-8 hours a day.  Really like this mouse a lot - just a great feel to it, and I love the flatter shape on the top.UPDATE 2: Been using for a few months now.  Started to have a minor issue.  Sometimes when I turn my system on, the mouse won't work.  I have to unplug and plug it in again. Not a major deal, but why? Never had this problem with any mouse ever - in 15 years.  Besides that, it is still a good mouse.  Looks and shape/comfort are top notch for me.I use it to play Borderlands 2 and Ghost Warrior and it works great.UPDATE 3: Mouse has become VERY laggy - not happy.  It worked well for about 4 months, and then started having problems.  $85 for 4 months = O_O - Opened a ticket or case with customer service, but they have not responded.  I love the mouse when it worked.  Next time I will think twice when reading multiple negative reviews on a product.UPDATE 4: Company did respond to me asking me for my receipt, and stated they would replace under warranty.  I responded within 1 hour, and sent them a copy of my Amazon receipt.  They never responded to me.  I called Discover, and they are n the process of refunding my FULL purchase price because the company has not responded to them.  At least I will get my money back, because the mouse is basically unusable at this point.  It works ok for a very short time, and then starts to lag.A really cool mouse when it works.  If they could fix the bugs - it would be awesome.  As it stands, it's not worth the money nor the aggravation."

Don't buy any Green Coffee Extract that doesn't explicitly state a guaranteed minimum of 50% Chlorogenic Acids."
2823715,B000B837XI,Now THIS is TV!,"24 has to be the most thrilling show on TV. If you're tired of shows like Lost or Desperate Housewives, which while good, seem to take perverse pleasure in beating around the bush to the point where you want to put a brick through the screen, take a look at 24. This is how TV should be made. Sharp dialogue. Sharp Characters. Sharp action. But that's not the best of it! What's the most riveting and yet satisfying aspect of 24? The fact that something happens week in week out and, at the end of the series, instead of EVERYTHING building to a cliff-hanger with which to tease you till the start of the next season, 24 delivers the goods and resolves the entire season's storyline. What could be more satisfying? Season 4 is superb. Once you slap a disk in your DVD player, it's so difficult to turn the thing off and stop watching - you just want to keep going and going and... What greater compliment to everyone concerned in its production."
3754012,B001V8U12M,"Just plain ""great""","This makes putting your RV jacks up/down so much easier. Hand screwing is so much more work than doing it with a power implement!Simple product but works ok, however kinda looks like cheap metal so I  am concerned if it will rust over time (time will tell as it is most probably NOt made in the good 'ole USA). Need a good battery drill (preferably ar least 18 V0 to get the jacks down or up, depending onhow high off the ground that your trailer is)."
3628353,B000GL4NPQ,Great Protection for my seat!,"I got this seat cover for my labradoodle puppy. I love it. It fits nicely in my back seat, it is not bulky, it cleans up easily and protects the seat against anything the puppy gets into! Installs easily and matches with my car interior. I put an old towel down on top of it for when we go into the water and that is all I need to know my seat is safe from moisture and dirt. It also protects the seat from the dog's nails. I don't have to worry about cleaning the seat. Good investment, I have ordered one for my daughter and her dog!"
1298043,B000BUGNNM,Good bag,"This bag is well padded, has backpack straps to carry comfortable, and several pockets to hold cable, extra strings, picks, and much, much more. For the price, I feel like it is a steal. Some people complain about the smell. It kind of smells like motor oil. It is strange, but being I have been around that smell so much, it doesn't bother me. Be warned about it though."
82845,B007P84VGY,didnt recieve,didnt even recieve my product. very dissapointing. was super excited for this to come but it never did. not happy.
1456462,B003DNLDUC,War in the North,"The Lord of the Rings: War in the North takes place concurrently with The Fellowship of the Ring. It follows an elf, a dwarf and a ranger as they attempt to impede Sauron's forces in the northern areas of Middle-Earth. The game features hack-n'-slash style combat with RPG features such as leveling up, skill trees and collecting of items. Each class (elf, dwarf, ranger) has it's own abilities. Eradan has stealth skills, Farin is adept at melee and mining for gems while Andriel specializes in magic.GraphicsGraphically, the game is great. The level design is top notch and I felt immersed in the world of Middle-Earth. Voice acting and lip movement was spot on (although not as natural as other games). The gore is realistic and the animations are great to look at. There are occasional environmental glitches but nothing to harp on about.Combat/GameplayYou are able to cycle between the main characters at checkpoints which is really great if you want to spend your play through among each character. You are able to ""give"" the other characters items from your inventory and they'll equip them even if you aren't playing as them. A good thing is that the others level up alongside you even if you're not playing as them. You can play single player (the others will be AI), you can play local co-op or your can play online co-op. There are also challenge maps which are akin to ""horde"" modes. These can be played in the aforementioned formats.Playing through the game you still keep your stats and looted items which is a boost to the replay-ability of the game. Items can be upgraded and customized for each character. The skill tree will allow you to improve your abilities and specializations. You can also increase stamina, melee, and other attributes using points earned when leveling up. This is standard RPG fare of course. The system isn't revolutionary but it is easy and fun to use.Combat wise, you use ranged and melee weapons. You can increase the power of attacks through leveling and also learn special moves. These special moves help vary the combat but it is still hack-n-slash. In a way, it is highly similar to The Two Towers and Return of the King games. Thus, if you liked that style then you should feel at home here. The enemies are varied from weak (a.k.a. Goblins) to powerful (such as trolls). The AI for enemies is generally good but there are some odd glitches (such as enemies just meandering a short distance from you without attacking). Ranged combat is standard aim and shoot.In terms of difficulty, that depends on how you level up your character. There are certain spots in the game where the difficulty spikes suddenly. One such instance is a siege in which you must stop two trolls from breaking down a gate. These are challenges that feel great to overcome. All the same, it seems that trolls are handed out freely and fighting them can get repetitive. At one point, the player faces a giant spider which is a healthy change that could have been done a bit more often in the game.There are towns (i.e. Bree) that you can shop and repair weapons. In these towns you can also get secondary quests. One such quest is to collect Athelas for a wounded ranger.SoundThe game sounds very good. It utilizes sound effects and score from the Lord of the Rings films which helps add on to the feeling of immersion. Sometimes they were a bit jarring when you recognized which parts in the films the sound effects belonged to and then saw how they were used in the game. A minor complaint but there it is.LengthThe game is 20+ hours depending on your level of exploration and how quickly you master combat and defeating the enemies. It is respectable for an RPG but some might feel that it should be longer. Keep in mind, you can play through and unlock new items and keep your old ones and stats.StoryI won't delve deep into the story but it intersects periodically with the Fellowship. It isn't an impressive plot and in many ways just seems to be present to allow you to kill Orcs. Which is fine by me since that's what I want from my Lord of the Rings games. The characters are flat but that makes them seem more like the caricatures that Tolkien used in his books. He drew inspiration from the epics which were not known for major character development.Overall, this is a standard RPG with a good system of combat. It is repetitive here and there but manages to be entertaining and a welcome relieve from disasters like Aragorn's Quest. I can't say that I whole-heartedly recommend buying it at release day price but it is at least worth a rental if you're a Lord of the Rings fan."
1404092,B0012N2AB6,Delightfully daft fun - strongly recommended,"As of this review, I'm just about to enter the Dragon's Labyrinth so I'm close fo finishing the game. I've spent every evening for the last two weeks playing this game, which is highly unusual for me. I can't recall the last time I found a game so addictive as this.I won't describe the basic game mechanics, as this has been covered elsewhere. My overall impression is that the playing style is very similar to Heroes of Might and Magic (HOMM) and the Final Fantasy games. I'd definitely recommend Easy difficulty setting for novice players - you'll cruise through most encounters, the exception being the big Boss battles. Normal difficulty setting is a moderately hard slog recommended for veterans of Turn-based strategy gaming. I haven't attempted Hard difficulty yet.What sets this game apart from both HOMM and FF is its sometimes daft sidequests. For example - I encountered a Frog in the Marshan Swamps. Apparently all the frogs in the swamp were being held at the Princes castle. Why? Because the Prince - seeking true love - had kissed every single frog in the swamp and turned them into beautiful princesses! It's a twisted fairy tale and I loved it.You also get to marry different females and have children - no, I'm not kidding. You can marry a Pirate, a hot-looking demon, a very male-looking dwarf or even a very-undead zombie. It's these kinds of daft design decisions that attracted me to this game.The graphics aren't much to right home about, but that's not why I loved this game. It's the depth of gameplay and the occasionally daft sidequests that made this game such a hoot to play. I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something a little different."

1746929,B000WER5SE,Great cordless drill,"I have worked in industrial maintenance for 10 years and have mostly used DeWalt stuff. I liked them ok, but for the price, I thought they would hold up better. My new job had the 28v Milwaukee drills and impact. As you would expect, since they are company owned, they take quite a beating. They are several years old and will still smack you in the face if you catch a bit in some metal (much to my coworkers delight)I thought enough of them to buy the 18v set for my own personal use. Great combo pack at the orange box. Drill, sawall, circular saw and light for [...] bucks. 150 less than the DeWalt set. I couldn't be happier. I would like to get the cordless jig saw, but at [...] bucks, I can't see spending that kind of money when a corded version can be had for 100. Overall I highly recommend them for contractors and industrial maintenance."
114501,B0092Y2IVY,Pretty nice product. Great price!,"Nice grippy feel. Keeps phone clean. Offers good protection and feels like a quality made item.The only thing I don't like about it, is that the power button is difficult to use. Requires a harder push to get the power button to respond. The volume rocker on the opposite side do not have that problem however."

I just had a check up with our vet and our 2 yr. old dogs teeth are wearing down.  She asked me if I was buying nylon chew toys.  She said she has had many dogs with this problem and it seems to be linked to these toys.  She said to get the Kong toys instead.  I came home, gathered them all up and ordered new."

1753201,B00176T5I4,"Good Cap, Not a good Finishing Tool","As a cap, this Dap Cap is just okay. It does close the open caulk tubes to prevent air from getting in, but there are other caps on the market that provide a tighter, more secure fit.  2 stars for the cap end.As a Finishing Tool, I wouldn't recommend this tool.  You would be better off using your finger in a plastic bag or directly beading the caulk.  You usually want to go over the caulk just once, but with this tool, you'll find yourself going over the caulk three or four times.  The finishing tool end feels like thin, cheap plastic, although it is bendable.  2 stars for the finishing tool."

783760,B007MFDUP8,"How can I t Be ""WITH FRIENDS??""","The title is Sketch with Friends, but you can't play WITH YOUR FRIENDS! This app tries to be a Pictionary-type game like Draw Something, but it has two major flaws.1) You can't tell the app to search for a particular person to play the game with. It only lets you into rooms with random people.2) You can only play two games a day for free. Yes, I know there is a $2 version that has unlimited games, but in order for a free app to be useful, you have to be able to actually USE it. Angry Birds, anyone?Additionally, there ae problems with players. It is possible to enter a room in order to play a game and find the other players are interested in blocking you for no reason - wasting one of your only two games.Also, several players find it funny to simply not play the game and just write out the word. Again, when there are only two game plays a day, this means there is no real playing time.Perhaps the developers could allow free players to accumulate games so that, if they don't play on Sunday, then Monday there would be 4 available games. As for the players, it would GREATLY benefit this app if the developers allowed a sign in process that let players select the particular players they want to challenge.At this point, there is no way I could recommend this app. If you really want a good version of Pictionary, try what everyone else here is suggesting and get Draw Something. Hopefully, Amazon will offer that app soon."
1371367,B000FDOU9E,A fun game...with some glaring oversights for the Star Wars faithful,"All of the reviewers got this one right.  This is a very fun game with some good graphics and improved action over the first.  I would be remissed if I did not bring up a few issues.  Bear with me as these are coming from a Star Wars fanatic.1) No ability to use ""first game"" characters in the Cantina.  This is a little thing but one of the really fun things in the first game was getting into huge lightsaber battles in the free roam area around the Cantina.  With the addition of Force powers, we should have been able to match Mace Windu against Sidious again etc.  However, for some reason you cannot take characters brought over from the first game into the Cantina...boo.2) Yoda fanboys must have programmed this game.  In an actual mission board with someone else, the Emperor cannot kill Yoda or Darth Vader with lightning.  I am all for the attention to detail where Yoda attempts to absorb the lightning instead of being picked up like all the others, but lightning is ultimately what defeated Yoda in III, and it killed Vader in Episode VI.  At least outside the Cantina you can shock the little green friend and your henchman to their respective ends.  The other annoying thing is that Yoda cannot be choked by Vader yet the Emperor can.  Come on...the Emperor is clearly Yoda's force equal or greater; yet he can be choked by Vader or shocked by another Emperor?  The Emperor should be immune to choke attacks, and he should absorb lightning like Yoda."
3749768,B000NPR32U,Not impressed with this type of tool!!!,"I failed when purchasing this tool.  I was trying to substitute for the real full size kit to do some of my jobs.I stongly suggest that you don't follow in my foot steps.I couldn't even use it once.  Myabe it could have been that it didn't offer the right size or configuration for the car i was working on that day.  But there is something else that is wrong with going with a tool like this.  Even if it had the right size or configuration, If the caliper piston has come out too far for this tool to fit in between the caliper and the piston then it would render it useless.I would recommend Astro Pneumatic 78618 Brake Caliper Wind Back Tool Set - 18 Piece.  Whether it's for professional use or personal, I strongly suggest a tool like this one.  It's going to be worth the investment, trust me.  As of this review time it's currently $36.92 from Amazon.Good luck"

1656359,B0061IUIB6,Nice stuff,"This is quite a pleasant spiced tea. The flavor of the spices doesn't overwhelm the black tea flavor, as it does with some other chai teas I've tried. Instead there's a nice even balance. I agree with another reviewer that this product isn't as strong as the masala chai you'd get in an Indian restaurant, but I don't mark it down for that; I think it stands on its own as a valid variation on the ""theme"" of chai tea. But you should be aware that you aren't going to get the robust, tongue-tingling product you might be used to from restaurants, and if you add milk, you may want to do so sparingly."

I cannot hold them anymore - have to return tomorrow. Do not recommend!"
1428788,B002672Z80,Faulty nunchuck app.,"So for my son and family it's like this: within the first few days of using this combo (it feels good in the hands and def is better for smaller hands, such as my son's hands) the Nunchuck controller, which fits too loosely into the Wiimote port, began to frequently lose its signal and stop my family's three-way gaming experience which we had been looking forward to since before Christmas.  What a disappointment.  I plugged the Nunchuck into a Nintendo brand Wiimote and that's when I noticed that the controller's plug-in fits loosely causing for the signal to be easily disrupted with a very small amount of flailing going on (at first I thought it was my kid until I tried it out through this and an official Wiimote).We tried the cheap version because dinero's tight and I know a lot of people know what that's like.  But after this and with the hassle of a return I think I'm going to stick to either the Nintendo brand itself or, if I choose a third party, I'll buy it from a local store so the return won't be a hassle.Live and learn."
66238,B0064TBZ5U,Simple case. Probably won't last longer than 3 months.,"(2013/02/05)Everything about this case works great, the side buttons line up perfectly and work great, etc. The only complaint I would have is that it only wraps around the sides (the most important part, anyway) and DOES NOT cover the back. You cannot tell in the product picture, but both the front and the back remain exposed.The case is sleek, but simple.--------(UPDATE 2013/06/06, 4 months later)Ok, I had to knock down my review 3 stars because about a month or two ago this case just started coming to pieces and quickly became useless and unusable. The external buttons fell off and the outer lips that protect and encase the phone started peeling off horribly. I had only been using it for a couple months."

12036,B002PY7P2K,Buyer beware....,"I usually don't leave reviews unless I can remain positive for the most part but I really feel like I need to voice my opinion about this product. I am one of those people who think they can read all the negative reviews and then think it will be better for me because I am really good with this stuff. I was dead wrong.I have wanted a pair of these for a very long time now but after only a week with these things I have had nothing but problems,-Half the 'felt' from the headband is already falling off. It's all over my head every night and very annoying and makes the product look terribly cheap.-The cheesy fold to power off/ power on is a complete joke and the hinges feel extremely fragile to me and likely to last less than a few months at most. This means there is no way to wear them around your neck if out and about with no other way to hold them and wish to have them turned off. And it also means you have to fold them in order to charge with out interfering with your backup bluetooth headset. I found this to be a very annoying problem becuase I wanted to avoid hinging them as much as possible because of the cheap hinge feel.-The charging indicator works nothing like advised in the manual. You plug it in and the battery blinks red for 2 hours and then just turns off. It never turns to green like it is supposed to and unless it does it wont turn on. The first charge took over 4 hours, 2 hours blinking red and then turned green after another 2 hours of no indication light at all. The second charge I had it plugged in for 5 hours, it blinked red for the first 2 hours and then did nothing for the next 3 hours and when I went to use them the battery was still dead!-Terrible, uncomfortable fit that will have your ears throbbing within the hour and a design that in no way attempts to stay flat against your ears or stay even remotely positioned on your head in an active environment.-Constant clicking and static sounds heard during silent periods between songs/during pause time.-It is not possible to initiate voice commands with the headset. Long pressing the center button only puts it in pairing mode to pair with multiple devices at the same time. Seriously a bluetooth hands free headset that cannot initiate voice commands so I can make a call?-Jabras customer support declined to respond to my emails or call me despite their *STOP DO NOT RETURN TO STORE* labeling. I gave them a fair chance to support their product and they declined.+On the bright side when they did work the phone calls were crystal clear and music sounded amazing with deep rich lows and crisp vibrant highs with plenty of volume even when working in noisy environments with power tools. No call complaints what so ever.+Volume controls worked very well, precise and consistent for me. EVEN with my work gloves on.Promptly returned.

1420263,B001HWB68K,90% Hype 40%Fight,"I'm sorry but it's been typical for Microsoft to either prematurely release something half baked or too much hype but doesn't deliver, just like their OS that's why my next laptop would be a Mac. This is basically 90% the same thing as Halo 3 but a lot boring. I was impressed somewhat the first 20 minutes of the game but that's it. About a few levels up and I traded the game after a week. This game would probably get higher reviews from teenagers and below. But the real guys who want substance will be disappointed. Graphics are a mixed bag of nuts, some are really good but then mostly cartoonish. The streets are too dark you don't know where to go and gameplay is highly repetitive + you hear those 2 stooges sound alike aliens again. It's a tough market out there for this game to compete with the likes of Uncharted 2 recently released and Modern Warfare 2 which will sell next week. I had a lot more fun with Uncharted 2 and Batman Arkham Asylum.I would pass this game and save the money for the others mentioned above."
1827749,B000001Y5D,Music's too sluggish for Linda Perry's strong voice,"This album is a little too sluggish at times. While I like What's Up, the rest of the album struggles to find an identity. Too many of the songs sound like ripoffs of every alternative band that was hot in 1992.  But the strong standout is Linda Perry's strong vocals. She sounds like she's not having it! Linda wins on the singing alone on every cut. But the music doesn't really match up. Perry right now is a very hot producer and songwriter for singers like Christina Aguilera, Pink, Gwen Stefani, Kelly Osbourne and countless others. Her Beautiful song for Christina even won a Grammy!  She has really come a long way from this already forgotten band,and I'm sure some of the members are in other bands or quit music. Don't ask Linda to be on a One-Hit Wonders show (which VH-1 is so obsessed about these days) about this band--she's too busy making hits for the masses and I'd rather hear her do that now!"

1836678,B000002KH3,MOTT HALEN,"One of the greatest party albums of all time by one of the greatest party bands of all time. These young tearaway Americans knew how to rock and enjoy themselves to the limit and beyond.Discovered by Gene Simmons of ""Kiss"" after playing the American Club circuit they were rushed into the studio with experienced rock producer Ted Templeton and came out with this raw product.At the time (1978) it was given no chance, a fully fledged Rock 'n' Roll album at the height of the seventies disco scene. However, straight to the top of the charts it shot, almost single-handled killing of disco (for which we should all be eternally grateful) and giving Van Halen 4 top ten hits along the way.As for debut albums this one just about tops the tree, especially for a bunch of total unknowns.At least half the songs on this eponymous debut are still considered one hundred percent solid gold classics. Each band member establishing their own character in every song. Frontman and show man extraordinaire Dave Lee Roth pants, rants, screams, and pouts his way through the album like the old tart he was. Sticksman Alex Van Halen made his own sound, very heavy drums with plenty of double bass work and open high hats, always pushing the other members of the band to the limit. Michael Anthony was the ultimate good time rockin' bass player. In later years he had a guitar painted and shaped like a bottle of Jack Daniels.But the man who really grabbed the headlines was the soon to become legend Eddie Van Halen creating his own unique style with legato, palm silencing, fat rhythms, finger pinching, and hand tapping; almost every song starts with something original from the man. After the opening salvo of ""Runnin' With The Devil"", Eddie is allowed to let rip with ""Eruption"" one minute thirty seconds of guitar that would change the world of guitar rock forever, revolutionizing the guitar community and inspiring a thousand imitators into the heavy metal lexicon.A magnificent debut for sure, but maybe the band should of held onto a few of their blockbuster tunes to bolster the lean years that started after 1984 and continued to the present day. (I mean, does anybody even know who is lead vocalist with them now? And does anybody care?)But on this album Van Halen amply demonstrates their drive showmanship, sense of fun (Ice Cream Man) and musicianship throughout, blowing the needle off the scale on such tracks as the old Kinks classic ""You Really Got Me"", ""Atomic Punk"", and ""Ain't Talkin About Love"".Turn it up and turn on. Party time boys and girls.Mott the Dog."
3757644,B00469L32A,Hundreds of Micro-fine Scratches,"The moment I took these out of the package and felt how abrasive they were I suspected that they would scratch alloy/clear coated wheels. So, instead of first trying them on my $3K, presently installed Lexani's I tried them on one of my winter-wheel Beyerns. The wheel is clean alright, but Lo and behold, that wheel now has hundreds of micro-fine scratches all over it. The material is just way too abrasive for alloy/clear coated wheels, it literally feels like the scrub brush we use to clean the shower.Anyway, they're great for cleaning calipers so I'll use them for that."
1837676,B000002L75,the best of the middle-era depeche mode,"'some great reward' is perhaps depeche mode's funniest album title. as the band inched closer and closer to the global domination that would one day be theirs, one can help but wonder if a be-skirted martin looked at sun-in'd-bangs dave and said, 'is this all we get?'  or maybe it's the bands nod to its increasing fanbase, or a middle-finger to those who thought there were going to get another mildly poppy, pleasant, inoffensive DM album (though it started with 'construction time again, let's face it, this was the death knell of the 'photograph of you,' 'see you,' 'new life,' 'just can't get enough' dm brand of music).no, no, dear friends, this wasn't your daddy's dm.  suddenly martin was clad in s&m; gear, handcuffs, leather (or was it pleather?), dave put a little sun-in in his hair, alan was a full-feldged member, and fletch, well, he was fletch (pushing his mic back and forth on stage and little else).  'some great reward,' i believe, was the blueprint for albums like 'pretty hate machine,' everything nitzer ebb did do, front 242 would do, and spawned a generation of knock offs (red flag, seven red seven, cause and effect). 'industrial' music? it started with 'some great reward.''some great reward' is the album that came to define the depeche mode *sound.* it's cold and detached, it's pervy undertones bubbling just below the surface.  from the get-go 'some great reward' sounds like an album recorded squarely under the fist of the iron curtain.  'something to do' sounds like heavy machinery dropped off a 100ft ledge--agressive and relentless. 'lie to me' and 'if you want' drip in ambiguous sexuality.  of course there's 'master and servant' and it's fairly blatant s&m; references and 'blasphemous rumors' in which martin (?) questions God's role in every day life. i'll forgive martin for 'somebody'--a song so sweet it should by right come packaged with a tube of toothpaste and mouthwash.'some great reward' pointed DM in a new direction they would later build on with 'black celebration,' 'music for the masses,' and culminate with 'violator.' in this regard it serves as an important stepping stone in the band's evolution--it was a precursor to the defining DM sound.  perhaps that reason alone is enough to merit buying this album. and if that reason's not enough, it's still got some KILLER songs, truly memorable singles, and just enough dark matter to keep the trenchcoat kids and enough catchy melodies and verses to keep the preppy polo-wearing goofs happy."
1303030,B005M0KLGQ,"Not all of its sounds are great, but there's plenty","I revised a previous 4-star review after playing with the Joyo British some more and especially after using it for direct line-in recording.  I now rate it at 5 stars.The phrase ""Marshall in a box"" gets thrown around a lot, but usually the people using it have a particular Marshall amp in mind.  For example, the Wampler Plexi-Drive sounds like an older Plexi, while a MI Audio Crunch Box will do that 80's JCM compressed high gain tone.  On the recommendations of several people, I picked up the Joyo British Sound hoping it could clone the full spectrum of those different amps.Does the British Sound succeed at that goal?  Yes and no.  On certain settings, the British Sound does offer a convincing, tube-like sound reminiscent of a Marshall cabinet.  You can clean it up quite a bit, and it works very well as a ""foundation"" pedal, placed last in your effects chain to give the amp Marshall ""character"", but boosted by other overdrive and distortion pedals.(Note: The pedal is actually its own preamp, so the recommended use of it is to plug it directly into the power amp section of a combo amp, or into a PA system or mixer directly.  You can use it in  the effects chain into another preamp, but that will diminish its effectiveness)But despite those good traits, there's just a few things ""off"" about it.  First, it seems to add quite a bit more noise (""hiss"") than some of the other Joyo Sound pedals.  Or perhaps it's just more noticeable due to the fact that this is supposed to be a ""Marshall"", so i turned it up.  Second, as several other reviewers noted, the Voice control seems exactly backwards of what it should be - turning clockwise makes it sound thinner.  On the other three Joyo Sound pedals, the opposite is true.  Functionally, this really should mean nothing, but it does make it a bit more confusing to dial in.If you read the manual for the Tech21 British (upon which this pedal is supposedly cloned), they claim that 9:00 on the Voice/Character knob would be JTM/Bluesbreaker territory, 12:00 would be Plexi, and anything above that gives you the ""presence boost of a 70's Metalface"".  I haven't tried all those amps, but perhaps it's meant to brighten up as you turn it up, and that's just a design choice.I think it's possible to get the ""Marshall"" tone you want out of this thing, but you have to work the EQ knobs with each adjustment of the Voice knob.  At this price, hard to complain too much."
1347331,B0000CDYOH,Syberia II a stunning completion of Kate and Hans&#65533; journey.,"Montr&eacute;al-based Microds and artist Benot Sokal have teamed up once again to bring us the final chapter to Syberia, a mythical island where mammoths still roam.  In 2002's Syberia (rated Game of the Year), promising New York lawyer Kate Walker traveled to France to oversee a simple factory buyout. The factory owner, Anna Voralberg, had died, and left a mysterious heir--her brain-damaged brother, Hans, who was somewhere deep in the Russian tundra. Kate journeyed across a Europe recovering from the scars of Communism in order to find the heir and be done with it, but along the way she began to care about Hans and his fantastic mechanical creations. The first Syberia ended with Kate jumping aboard the train in Aralbad, leaving her past and journeying towards an unknown future in Hans' quest to reach Syberia.Syberia II picks up at that exact point, with Kate and Hans rocketing along in the snowy wilderness towards Syberia. As in the previous game, there are four worlds to discover: the gloomy border town of Romansbourg, the vast Great North Passage, the Youkol Village and the Last Voyage. Kate revisits Valadilene, Hans' birthplace, in a sepia-toned dream sequence (the haunting music here sounds as if it was composed by Danny Elfman, i.e. haunting chimes, bells and soloists).In addition to Kate, Hans and Oscar (the cowardly automaton train driver), several characters from the first game have cameos here as well. There are multiple new characters to aid Kate on her quest: the spunky orphan Malka, Colonel Emeliov Goupatchev, bartender and surrogate parent Cirkos, a Youkol chief and shaman. There are enemies that threaten to end Kate's quest: the stern Orthodox Patriarch and bumbling villains Igor and Ivan. Animal characters also play an important role in Syberia II: the spirit guardian Harfang, lemmings, man-eating penguins (!), ferocious grizzly bears, and a Youki, a loyal dog-seal hybrid bred by the Youkol people.There are several notable improvements from the first game, including major graphics improvements: reflections in water and glass, ice textures, and uniform fabric and decals; real time snowfall and footstep marks; dynamic lighting and shadows; animated fog; and better in-game animation. The cutscenes are gorgeous and numerous, and can be replayed at any point. The music is as immersive and beautiful as in the first game, and cycles in and out of gameplay. For much of the time the only sounds are of Kate's footsteps, snow gently thudding off branches and roofs, and nature sounds (birds, wind, wolves howling, ice cracking).The puzzles are more organic in nature than the first game and there is more of an action element: Kate must rock climb, scale antennae towers, swing across chasms and outwit attackers (human and animal). An interesting (but unnecessary) subplot involves a detective hired by her employer to hunt Kate down and bring her home. Kate's cell phone, a crucial element in the first Syberia, has several brief appearances, but Kate generally hangs up mid-call (If I were her I would have thrown it off the train!).Syberia II has much more of a spiritual element based on Youkol medicine and shamanism (you must make a Youkol potion, summon a spirit guide, and journey into a spirit world), and the ending ties up storylines from both games. There are several tear-jerker moments in the game.There are optional subtitles for the hearing-impaired, a ""Syberia recap"" that neatly packages the major events of the first game into an entertaining trailer for those not familiar with the Syberia universe, and replay option for cinematic cutscenes. Syberia II is visually stunning, thought-provoking and a more than satisfying sequel that lives up to the impossibly high standards of the first Syberia. Bravo!"

1769290,B002HEY2QU,They overdrive the LED's,"We bought two of these six months ago.  They looked really cool and had a wonderful projection.  They even had a light sensor to shut off during the day.  Unfortunately it is now obvious that the company selling the product, Jasco Products of Oklahoma City, bought them from a Chinese manufacturer that seriously overdrove the LED's.  One is dead and the other is very dim.  This is inexcusable considering they charge $10 for one of these at Home Depot. For an extra $.25 per light they could have done it right and these would have lasted for many years.  No manufacturer is so incompetent as to ""accidentally"" overdrive the LEDs to this level.Shoddy Chinese manufacturing meets American corporate greed.  This experience has soured me on Home Depot as well.  They still carry this junk."

There were way too many long drawn out scenes and the opera scene had to be the worse, I swear it felt like ten long drawn out moments with the same dreadful music playing, looking at Nicole Kidman's face.  Also I found the story line to be very disgusting.  If you are a sick warped individual this movies perfect for you and I could have did without the sex scene that looked like it was from a cheap porno.  The movie was a waste of money.Rose DesRochersTodays-Woman.net"
3700878,B004DJL31Y,Bad color match with door guards AND tears easily,"Ordered this in khaki along with khaki door guards. Door guards are khaki and match my car's interior. This is a pale green color which doesn't match either the door guards or the interior. I know they would say it's a different dye lot, but pale green is not khaki and should not have been sold as khaki. This indicates poor quality control, altho the cover seems durable enough.Update: The door guards don't stay in and are being returned, anyway, so I am going to keep the seat cover, since by itself it doesn't look bad. It is slippery. It stays in place -- I have fabric seats -- but the dog slips a bit on the top surface. I wonder if washing it will soften it up a little.Further update: I am pleased with the durability of the cover and upped the rating to 4 stars. It's still slippery, but handles dirt well and stays put and seems like it will last a long time.Further further update: It's now the end of April and the cover has a big tear in it and several smaller holes. It's not sturdy canvas at all but instead, thin fabric with some plasticky coating. Back to two stars.  It's unfortunate, because it is very nice looking and fits the back seat perfectly. For such a nice design, it's a shame that they used such cheap fabric. With a sturdy canvas. this would be a great product."

Meowmie finally managed to figure out the complicated and brain-taxing (snorrrrt..) assembly after studying the directions that came with it. She was truly fortunate I was there to help though. Abstract shapes are NOT her strong-suit!So, we got this put together and then Meowmie sprinkled the catnip (included) liberally over the top of this thingey.

1301064,B002IC1D5E,"Simple, sturdy,portable and useless for electric guitars or basses","I was looking for a portable fold-up stand that I could take to gigs and searched around.  Found the Guardian at Amazon and thought for $10, how could I go wrong?  Oops! Wrong.  The stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but I found it next to impossible to get my Fender Jazz bass to stand up in it.  The lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow.  This is OK for a lightweight acoustic that you don't care too much about, but for for an electric guitar or bass, no way.I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support.  Live and learn."

You people writing the four and five star ones - did you get the same thing I did?Wow.  What an ineffective piece of plastic that arrived from Amazon to my doorstep.  Every time I try getting a piece of ""helper tech"" to do something (in this case, bypass the need for a Bluetooth connection for my iPhone, since I don't have that in my car), it never seems to work.  The reviews looked OK, so I took a shot.  I should have known better.Hooked this thing up, and got no noticeable increase in volume for me.  It was effectively an ""iPhone holder"".  I didn't even get so far as to see how the mount work would in my truck, as I never got it working with the ""amplifier"".

The Graphics were horrible, too rough and generic. To make matters worse, they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.The missions were dull. Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse, you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping, so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun, but it gets dull fast. Basicly, it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points. other than that, this is probably the worst game I have ever played. Don't buy this game...rent it at most..or borrow it."

1860952,B00006IK19,"Pathetic album, pathetic review for said album... what's to like?","I expect much more than this from the guy who wrote ""The Pretender"" and like five other great songs. The low points are incalculable. Let's start at the first song, the title track. It's Browne trying to philosophize about sex. Needless to say, it falls apart quite quickly. ""The Night Inside Me"" is an introspective dud. Seriously, it's another one of those ""I was so stupid then, but now I'm smart"" songs that you've all heard waaaaay too many times for them to be convincing anymore. ""Don't You Want to Be There"" is, for some incomprehensible reason, stretched to eight minutes when it didn't have enough ideas for two. And he's in ""look-at-me-I'm-a-poet"" mode in several songs (""Walking Town""; nightmarish inspirational ""About My Imagination""; ""My Stunning Mystery Companion""). Only ""Casino Nation"", with its clever and a heavy bass line ""The way the hammer shapes the hand!"" motif, is any good. No matter how restlessly average Browne usually is, at least he's tuneful for the most part. He misses out on that here."

1847725,B00000A6JS,grew on me,"Beautiful.  Dark.  Powerful.  Brilliant.  Just some of the many words that can describe Opeth.  MAYH, like Still Life, Morningrise, Deliverance, and just about anything else by this band, is an album to epitomize why these awesome Swedes have gotten such praise.  They are not your typical &quot;make a lot of noise, scream out dumb lyrics&quot; metal band; these guys have character, and while the melodic &quot;death&quot; metal label may drive some away, Opeth is a band that anyone with any type of taste in music can at least respect.  The mixture of acoustic passages, brutal growling, clean singing, precision drumming, and brilliant guitar work is at some of its best on My Arms, Your Hearse.  The lyrics are, as always, very thought-provoking, taking listeners through a musical journey that only Opeth can deliver.  So you have to use your imagination a little, that's called poetry.  Poetry isn't some rapper &quot;creating&quot; a way to make 'hood' and 'sure' rhyme.  Poetry is being able to force listeners to focus on the music and make themselves part of it, while being abstract enough to keep them thinking.  In my opinion, MAYH is one of Opeth's most poetic albums to date.  Favorite track: &quot;April Ethereal&quot;"

3653915,B0017XBDPA,GREAT VALUE,"When you consider the cost of sofa covers that never stay in place, get all hairy and dirty and require cleaning....this is the ultimate alternative and it teaches the dogs to just plain stay off of the couch.  We have had this for about 6 months now and we rarely ever turn it on anymore and don't even put it on the couch all the time after we use the couch either but the dogs have gotten the message to stay off of it.  When one of the four dogs does think its suddenly safe to use the couch then we put this back on and she is quickly reminded that the couch is off limits!  Wish we had gotten one of these years ago and we wouldn't have had to get a new couch six months ago!  This has saved our new couch from damage and dirt from pets!"
181886,B00FTULQJU,Needs a DYI to work and interferes with NFC,"I really was looking forward to using this Qi card with my Note 3, as I was using one with my Galaxy S3 without problems on my Samsung and Nokia charging pads. It took a week to arrive. However, the Qi card received from Docooler did not look like the one on the picture - the one I got had only 2 (not 3) charging contacts. No matter how I tried aligning them with the ones on the phone, it would not charge. I contacted the seller requesting a refund/replacement - it is possible that I was simply sent a wrong card, or a defective one. Of note, the plastic sleeve it came in with stated the Qi receiver was for Note 3.EDIT: I received another of these Qi cards, this time purchased on Ebay. That one also had only 2 charging contacts. I read on XDA forums that the Qi charging contacts with Docooler brand weren't properly seated and needed to be pressed into place extra firmly, something I didn't have to do with my S3 Qi receiver. I taped a piece of a folded-over business card between the cover and the Qi receiver contact points to apply extra pressure on the contacts, and it worked! Same DIY worked with the old card I thought was defective. Will change my rating and review accordingly.EDIT 2: Tag stopped working when I tried to reposition it, after realizing that it was interfering with NFC. I used Samsung TecTiles2, trying to start Car Home Ultra app with a Qi car charger. It definitely interferes with NFC, covering most of the battery. Interestingly, the Galaxy SIII insert also covers most of the battery but does NOT interfere with NFC and does NOT need a DYI to work correctly. Will be looking to get another receiver or cover that does not interfere with NFC and is designed to properly align with Note 3 charging contacts."

The flavor is the same, but the texture is now unpalatable. The vermicelli is slippery and gelatinous, just an awful combination. I wrote to the manufacturer in the hopes that they are getting lots of similar feedback."

247622,B000GCLULA,Work great and help healing,"These are great band-aids and will help your cuts or scratches heal faster. I especially like that they keep a wound sealed so it doesn't get dirt in it during the day at work or around the city. The waterproof aspect works pretty well -- not perfectly but very well for casual protection for a day.The only minor issue is that they are very light colored, so for most people it would be quite obvious that you're wearing a band-aid. Not a big deal, and these band-aids are now a key element in my toiletry pantry."
1695720,B00004SQF5,"Works great, doesn't heat up","First, I would like to say that I have used this for over a year and am VERY pleased with it, and here's why:1) The color stands out. I had a green cord from a different brand that I used with my hedge trimmer. Boy is my hedge trimmer sharp, it cut right through the extension cord. Imagine all the dangers that go along with that!2) Heavy duty. Some lighter gauge cords will got VERY hot, so be careful. In this instance, you get what you pay for....and if you are using this in a dry area, the last thing you want to do is start a fire.3) Cost. I have seen these at the local Home Depot/Lowes for at least 25% more!4) I have used this with my snowblower, edge trimmer, power washer, hedge trimmer, shop vac, leaf blower, etc., and have never had a problem. I have not experienced any problem in cold weather, down to 0 degrees. The windchill that day (yes I remember it because it was REALLY old) was below zero. The only thing is not to store this outside. As with anything, if you leave it exposed to the elements it may not last as long. Also, be sure to properly store it, and try not to kink it anywhere.The only downside is that it is heavy. No reason for a star reduction because all of them at this size are heavy (and they get heavier!).If you are looking to light some low voltage lights, etc., don't waste your money. If you are using saws, lawnmowers, etc., this is what you should be using."
1610812,B002RBTY66,If you divide chocolate lovers into two groups - 'Connoisseurs' and 'Amateurs'...,"...then I fall into the latter group.  I like dark chocolate better than milk chocolate, but other than that I'm not terribly picky.  I'm not the person that's going to be rolling a tiny bit of chocolate around in my mouth for five minutes then nattering on about its ""bouquet"" or its ""undertones"".  Nope, I'm going to do what 99% of the other women I know do:  scarf it down then feel ridiculously guilty about the calories.  Now that we've established that I am not a discerning chocolate lover, here's my take on the product...This is dark chocolate, but on the lighter side - cocoa content is just under 50%.  After the initial sweetness, you get a hint of chili ""burn"" - nothing dramatic, just a touch of heat.  This is a large bar (3.5 oz.) which, according to the nutritional information, is 2.5 servings.  Now if you have a fair amount of self-discipline, you could just break off a couple of squares and save the rest for another time.  That's one way to go.  Another option is to be more liberal with your interpretation of what qualifies as a ""serving"".  I like to keep it simple:  1 bar = 1 serving.  I enjoyed it, felt guilty for the rest of the night and promised myself I'd run a few extra miles as penance.Your mileage may vary."
1854173,B00004TA8K,really not all that good,"this album is way overrated. I like the first few songs alright and ""Get off"" and that's about it.

1303758,B00B1N06PO,Great Sound - Terrible Comfort,"Soooo bummed. I simply love the sound on these cans, but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface (not deep enough in the cups) and press down hard on my ears. The max time I can wear them is like an hour, and then I can't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain. I guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups, that might help. Also, on most of my other phones, the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces, while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet. So it's kind of like double trouble. However, these really do have great sound (especially the tight bass clarity). If it weren't for the discomfort factor, I would be using them all the time. As of now, I hardly use them at all. In fact, when I first tested these out, I was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more. But I'm glad I waited to really give them a more prolonged test. Of course, we are all of varying shapes and sizes, ha ha, so they might work for you where they don't for me. If so, you've got a bargain on some great cans. If not, ouch. Cheers!"

1675396,B00B2JUBJS,I basically disagree with every other review!,"I love cheez-its so I thought I'd try this different cheese flavor.  I also love provolone cheese so......sounds like a winning combination but it was NOT.  I found flavor to be severely lacking.  I didn't mind paying almost $5 for this small box of cheez-its when I was sure I'd love it according to all the great reviews but I did not love it, not even liked them.  I am sure I will eventually eat them over time because they are not discusting ....just blahhhh.  If they turn stale over time, that'll solve my problem of what to do with a product I don't really like.  Discard!  I truly did not find the provolone flavoring to be strong enough to translate to my taste buds.  If you find these good, I am happy for you but even my sister who loves cheez-its too said she did not like this flavor.  There are many other new cheese flavors available now so I am hoping some of them will be better than this one."
1299210,B000RW0GT6,I don't quite like it.,"I heard great things about the S6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, I bought it based upon reviews. I've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- The Seagull is comparatively unattractive. Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before.- I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. Seagull to me is over-hyped.Thanks for reading!"

3758985,B005EJGSQ2,Nice to have some heat in a cold car.,I am always colder than my wife so this works well to keep me warmer.  I really enjoy how fast they heat up and it makes driving more comfortable.  The drawback is they don't stay put very well when gettting in and out of the car.  Also the electrical cord is kind of a nuisance having it plugged in to the power outlet.
1439722,B002I0F5I2,What took me so long?!,"Uncharted 2 is a stellar third person (my personal fave kind of game) action-adventure shooter and a Playstation 3 exclusive.  In short, it's an essential title for all PS3 owners and offers an enjoyable Indiana Jones-esque experience with topnotch voice acting and gameplay.  In long, well, it's just as enjoyable, sans for a few glitches.The graphics are great, albeit not as polished as, say, God of War 3 or Red Dead Redemption (but considering they were released nearly 12 months after U2 came out that is understandable).  I found a few glitches, including some weird experiences with Drake being able to put himself halfway through walls and whatnot.  When he follows someone I also found him to be slightly harder to move when he's directly behind whatever character he may be in tow, but nothing too much to gripe about here.  Overall, stellar for the time, but not as good now (naturally).I found gameplay to be highly enjoyable, especially following the kind of games I love, ie God of War 3.  There's a lot of long jumps and climbing going on, and shooting while jumping and climbing as well (actually, there's a lot of shooting in general), and Drake frequently hangs off signs and takes out the bad guys like any normal person would.  The most affecting part of gameplay appeared to be camera angles.  Don't get me wrong, third person is my favorite type of game, but God of War 3 at least didn't immediately put the camera overhead so you'd have to move it but not in time before being shot a couple times and almost dying.  Finding where to jump to next on a wall sometimes (or even where to go) can be harder than it looks, largely because lots of the choices that to designers - which were probably obvious to them - to me, at least, blended in so well with the foreground that I often would leap and die several times in some areas before knowing what next to do.The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard in a game, both in terms of believability and the way it is carried out.  Nathan Drake is humorous and sarcastic, reminding me of the captain of Serenity from the Firefly TV series.  His lady friends also have amazing voices that fit them perfectly.  Cutscenes actually were believable because of how effective the actors/actresses were at voicing their respective character.In the end, Uncharted 2 is an amazing title.  It's got a lot going for it, but has a couple of quips that take away from the experience.  Overall: Get it."

1986587,0790732475,"Honestly, did anyone like this garbage?  Really?","When this film bombed (and bombed, hell, it's still bombing today), many blamed the great George Clooney for it.  Please!  Clooney was the least of this film's problems.  I saw this the first week it came out (with a friend who insisted on seeing it), and the theater vibe was the most uncomfortable one I've experienced.  Man, this film is BAD.  Overblown, overacted, overdirected, and very underwritten.  The Batman franchise took years to recover.  This is a great example of a film that was obviously cast before it was written.  The cast is certainly intriguing, but that's not enough to carry a film.The best part of the film was not actually on screen.  During an interminable scene where Batgirl attempts to break into her Uncle Alfred's computer, she takes forever (and I mean forever) to figure out the password.  It is Batgirl's (and Alfred's sister) mother's name, Peg.  It is rather bleedin' obvious.  A guy in the theater shouted Peg during this scene.  A split second later, Batgirl said ""Peg"".  The whole audience laughed (the only time they did the whole night), and the guy stood up and took a bow.  His comic timing was perfect.  This is the only fond memory I have of watching this film.  Luckily, Clooney's career recovered (he is a great actor), and so did the Batman franchise."

3104728,B001MYIXBQ,Dumb and Dumberer,"I have to say I'm surprised many of the user reviews of this movie are as positive as they are. For my dollar this didn't even reach a level of mediocre competence. And I'm not talking about just all the stupid stuff in the script either. This is plain lousy all the way around.Here's the scoop. Two girlfriends are on their way back from a vacation. They must have grabbed the red eye flight because the airport is nearly deserted when they arrive. They get a cut rate offer from a shuttle driver which they end up sharing with three other guys. Not long into the ride all realize this is not a normal shuttle and they're all fearing for their lives.One reviewer mentioned you need to suspend your disbelief on a few of the plot points. No. You need to suspend it on nearly all the plot points. This whole thing was unbelievably stupid. Most, if not all this was shot in and around Chicago. I don't care what day it is. Where in Chicago it is. Or what time of the day or night it is. There will always be some traffic. You will not see streets deserted for any length of time as they are in this movie. And when does a kidnapper allow his prey out of a vehicle to shop for stuff he will need to complete his task? Shouldn't he have done that before he even picked them up? Stupid stuff like this happens throughout the movie. There was also a point that telegraphed itself early on but it took them way too long to reveal it. And the directing is incompetent. He could not get through certain parts of scenes well enough to let the viewer know what was happening.What WAS happening here was that the set up did make me want to know how it would turn out. That was the only reason I stuck with this turkey, and the end was a real downer. It had a point in it so odd I wondered why it was in there. Don't bother with this. There are other similar titles out there that handle this sort of thing much better."
610855,B004X80QNG,such a good app,it has a steep learning curve but once you get used to it you'll realize that it is an awesome replacement for the default calendar. I use this all the time to keep my appointments and reminders. The only things it  is lissing is synching with google calendar (although it DID import from the calendar upon install) and a widget. It could use customizable alarm tones so that it could play different songs for diffrent appointments but that is just me nickpicking.

1720013,B000BO6G94,Nice when it works,"This is NOT a review of Amazon, but a review of the bulb. I bought four of the #9266 lights which each came with a 9166B bulb. All of them worked when I first installed them, but a week later one of the lights quit working. I swapped bulbs between two of the units and determined that the bulb was bad. For as expensive as these things are I expect them to be more reliable. I've had similar disappointments with other fluorescent lights from Lights of America. Considering that the lights are made in China, why do they have this name? The only way I can see to get a reliable light is to buy several and throw away the bad ones. Not very cost effective. I wish somebody else made these things.As for the claim that they put out the equivalent of 500W, I used these to replace four 400W metal halide lights. There is no way these put out as much light as my old lights, but I am glad to be rid of the high electric consumption and the buzzing."

The unit wobbles on the umbrella pole, which I could put up with, but the latch broke on the second use. The latch button is designed to pivot on a post inside the light. The plastic is very thin at the corner where it slips over the post and broke at that point, not leaving enough surface area to glue it back together. The lamp is not weatherproof so it must be removed and stored inside so it is virtually useless if it cannot be unlatched."

Following in the footsteps of `Blair Witch' and `Paranormal Activity', this movie suffers the same fate with a series of ""somes"". Some suspense, some horror but just when you think you're about to soil your seat, the moment is devoured by the usual shaky camera shit that renders confusion as you shrug your shoulders and shriek out a big ""what the hell is happening!"". Honestly, why do they persist with the found footage style? This films only redeeming feature is the nice visuals which capture the moon's dark lunar surface giving off an eerie feeling of hopeless isolation as paranoid astronauts Christie and Owen battle Russian conspiracies and an alien menace. Unfortunately by the time this alien menace revealed itself I was fighting my own battle with boredom.Best bit?Just watch the trailer, that has all the best bits!Did you know?The script was constantly re-written during the shooting of the movie."

If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try.

Now that they have settled into their new environment, the grains have almost doubled in volume and are exceptionally vigorous (they put my ginger beer plant to shame!).

1569509,B000V7710O,"Caution! warning - vital info before you order, make sure you know its packaged in china and could contain lead","First let me say I LOVE how they TASTE- but""Warning Warning,, Dont buy canned goods manufactured in China,, there is usually LEAD in the soldering/lining of these cans,, TOXIC TOXIC""yes and thats not even my words, thats someone elses comment that I found when I did a search for ""lead cans"" and ""china"".make sure you know what you are getting. the country of origin is clearly labeled as being from china.I ate these and afterwards I didnt feel so hot all day long the next day.Also Its worth noting that I ordered 2 cans, and one of them came severely dented and damaged.Also make sure you realize that if you try to return them , it wont let you, its not allowed to be returned under amazons return policy -it told me that when I clicked on return items. The odds of you getting a dented can seem very high. And im sure that if there is lead in the lining, that denting the can will only make it leech even more.its really a shame that there isnt an american company canning and selling these figs! c'mon american companies , get with the program!taste and texture wise they are great. They come with too much sugar syrup in the can, but if you drain them and give them a bath in pure water you can get most of the sugar to come off, so thats fixable. If there is lead leeching into the fruit though, that isnt fixable, or acceptable. I cant confirm or deny at this time that there is definatly lead, but I personally dont trust canned foods from any country outside of the usa.I know you can get lead toxicity from eating canned foods with lead lined cans, because I used to eat alot of canned papaya that was canned in tailand. I did a hair test a few months after eating tons of canned papaya, and the hair test showed me 23 times the normal limit of lead. Then i got a lead test kit to test the can and sure enough it was lead posative.im going to try to order another lead test kit and see if I can test these cans again myself, and maybe if I can get that done ill update this review with those results .meantime I have 2 more cans already ordered and shipped, and I guess I cant cancel or return them now and im gonna be stuck with the lead! I dont intend to eat them anytime soon, if ever. Id suggest severely limiting the amount of figs that you eat at once, if you do decide to eat them."

2460353,B000059PPN,A great film !,"I remember the first time I saw 'House By the Cemetary' I was in my early teens and since then I loved this movie.The background story leaves a few questions to be answered but it's a low-budget horror film,what did you expect?beyond the small details the film is fantastic!This film came out in 1984 to be exact(I should know I have the original Vestron Video),this film is not for the squeamish.If your'e unfamiliar with Lucio Fulci's films he has some realistic gore effects used in his movies.But if you can handle the SAW films,you can handle House By The Cemetary:)I would recommend renting it before buying it though."

This is one of the worst ""movies"" i've ever seen, if you can even call it a movie.  If you like absolutely terrible trance music and scenes that drag on too for lack of good editing, maybe.  The cover for this looked awesome, but i couldn't wait until it was over.  It took me four or five times to get through it, no lie. The plot is stupid, the acting is terrible, and half the scenes are just strobe lights and sound effects in a club.  Buy something better with your money."

1536339,B00014CZP8,Please get past the taste.,"You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better."
3758547,B004UPZXI0,A watered down detailer.,"Having some experience with spray detailers, I had an idea what to expect. Basically some gloss, a slick surface, and short-term protection. There is some controversy regarding whether water beading is a sign of good protection, but I won't get into that. What water beading (or sheeting) does accomplish is it at least shows the presence of product.There's another way to show presence of a car wax/sealant that a car detailer showed me years ago, and that's the steam test. It doesn't measure protection, per se; it just shows the presence of a product so you can see how uniformly it covers an area, how easily it comes off, etc. Basically you coat some product onto a bathroom mirror and allow steam to build up in the room. Areas of the mirror coated in wax/sealant will have a uniform layer of steam that is different from untreated areas. It won't repel steam, the barrier causes tiny water droplets to build up uniformly, (appearing as if there is 'more' steam there). You can try it yourself and see what I mean.I bring this up because after noticing that the V7 just didn't seem to do as much as other similar sprays (the gloss was fair but not very good, and I didn't notice the extra water beading that other spray detailers provided at least short term), I wanted to see what it was leaving behind. I did the test, using the V7, along side a couple other spray detailers.The results surprised me. The areas treated with V7 left very little behind, with some streaks of presence. I also applied some Meguiars UQW and Turtle Wax Ice, both of which showed solid coverage (and the TW had remarkable durability to removal, incidentally).  When I applied two more coats of V7 over its area, it began to show more signs of coverage, confirming my results: This appears to be an extremely watered-down detailer, high in alcohol so that it ""flashes"" (evaporates) quickly. It came completely off with a bit of soapy water, whereas the other products actually were rather stubborn to remove.I give it two stars because as a quick detailer, it's fine. It will clean off fine dust and fingerprints, and leave a wee bit of shine. In the gallon size the value is fair, but $18 or so per bottle is silly, seeing as how it has just about zero sealant properties and even the shine it leaves is inferior to some $8 spray waxes.I've heard that CG is hit and miss with their products, but V7 is generally regarded as one of the hits. In my experience, it is not. Maybe they make some good stuff, but this isn't it. I don't want to judge the company by one product, so I'll give another one of their products a try, probably.  I gotta say, they do a really good job with graphic design on their packaging; especially the ""vintage"" line. I digress."
2695260,B0001KL5HQ,A comdedic treat in the tradition of Monty Python,"This set is a real treat for Kids In The Hall fans with more than 8 hours of material plus every uncut show from season one. If you've never seen TKITH before, these shows will make you an instant fan; that's what happened to me after seeing just a couple of these early shows the first time years ago. The DVD includes new previously unseen interviews with the Kids and with producer Lorne Michaels, 30 minutes of performances from the Rivoli Theater show, plus audio commentary, sketches from the pilot episode, biographies, and even more.If you appreciate comedy such as Monty Python's Flying Circus then you will thoroughly enjoy the demented surreal twists and zaniness found in this set, such as the sketch about ""The Eradicator"". The comedy in most sketches is very dense and holds up on repeated viewings, allowing you to pick up more bits of hilarity each time you see them. Very few shows this clever, funny and original have ever been on television. If you like entertainment with the aforementioned qualities and many layers of humor, such as Mystery Science Theater 3000, Black Adder, Fawlty Towers, The Simpsons or Red Dwarf, buy this Kids In The Hall set and you will not be disappointed. It will provide many hours of laughter. Incidentally, the theme music during the opening titles is terrific; it rocks!"

Something has changed (and I admit it may be me). I can't even get a good taste out of it when I brew the smallest size on the Keurig, so I will not be buying this any more."

Right on the box it says product of Mexico..!!!!!  Sorry not for ME... I want made in the USA products on my table .. won't spend $$ on this junk againNever again..Now what to do with the boxes I do have..??I swear these cereal companies  have no idea what people want to eat..

58592,B005PVXKC4,Finally found a good bluetooth!!,"I have tried a few others, like Jawbone ERA, and some other Motorola's, but this is definitely the best!!I always got a sore ear after a couple hours with the others, even with the most comfortable ear cushions.I can wear the Sliver all day, in either ear, and I basically forget its there. The carry case is a fantasticidea, it keeps your Sliver safe in a pocket or duffelbag, and charges it at the same time. I use my Sliver formusic(iheartradio) alot too. You can also download MYMOTOSPEAK from Google Play(Android phones)if you want to be able to listen to and dictate text messages. I tried it but I like the voice commands software that came with my DroidX2 better. I would highly recommend this bluetooth."

1925158,0780631684,&quot;Destination&quot; is  a Mess,"When I first saw this film I was looking forward to what I thought would be an interesting new thriller. Although it turned out to be extremnly violent and with an unbelievable story line. Ihis movie starts out wonderfully with the scen at the airport and the dream and then the plane crash.  But after the that its basically a gore fest with blood every 5 minutes.  After a few deaths (which I might ad are extremly random and could rarely occur) Devon Sawa thinks that there is a pattern to which these deaths are occuring, and basically the whole movie is just watching people die then watching people try to escape the death.  Although the movie did try, and the look of the movie is great the overall movie is a mess.  And before watching notice the R Rating this movie drops the F- Bomb thousands of times and many times its pointless."
1862084,B00007FGLS,Changed my mind,"I only started listening to Hip-Hop seriously a few years ago, and this was the first Nas album i'd ever heard.  I picked it up after hearing I Can on the radio, I loved this track though soon realised it was nowhere near the best song on the album.  Gods Son is a great album, it made me want to buy all of Nas' other albums.Notable tracks include the Eminem produced The Cross, Get Down, Book of Rhymes, Made You Look and Warrior Song and also Thugz Mansion N.Y (is Tupac turning in his grave?).  If I were reccomending 1 Nas album it would be Illmatic and if you like that then this is an essential purchase.  Nas goes deeper in Gods Son than probably any of his other material, mainly because of the recent death of his mother, and no track highlights this more than Dance, a heartfelt tribute to Ann Jones.I have re-written this review as I originally gave it 4 stars, but on listening more it deserves a 5.  The only bad track is Zone Out (which is possibly Nas' worst track ever), but every other song is great, I would put Gods Son on a par with Stillmatic as his second best album."
1885730,B00ERMICY8,Is It Just Me?,"Is it just me or does this song = ""Somebody I Used To Know"" (Gotye)?  Derivative, auto-tuned to hell & irritating as usual. Another classic from Hannah Montana. thankfully, this one won't last long, either."

No more accidentally yanking your tablet or phone off the table, stationary bike, etc when you turn your head. Sounds great.Con: a little tight for me,..I have a huge head, Einstein sized.

1824345,B0000019KE,too bad they are gone,"slint was an amazing band, and in many ways this untitled cd single was  the perfect way for them to end their too short career. the first track is  similar to the songs from spiderland (only better done, focusing more on  the instrumental buildup, and without the lyrics), while the second song is  a remake of a song off tweez. they are both excellent songs, showing why  slint was one of the most influential bands of the last 15 years."
1344006,B00009WAUK,Disappointing coming from a great company like Square/Enix,"Let me start off by saying that I've been a fan of the final fantsy series since FF5.  Each one has been different and had it's own good points and bad points.  As for FF Tactics Advanced, the bad far outweigh the good.  Let me tell you the good points first.1. It's on GBA, meaning it's portable and that you can play it anywhere at anytime.2. Player's are able to change jobs as in the original FF Tactics.3.  The graphics are pretty decent for a GBA game.Now for the bad1.  The Story - the story for FFTA has to be the most thoughtless and simple ones for any FF game to date.  Your character is warped into an alternate dimension where the Final Fantasy video game becomes real.  Your objective now is to find a way back home (how creative).  You join a clan of other characters and fight with other random clans throughout the game.  You advance the plot by completing various missions.  You eventually have to fight your friends from the real world who don't want to go home and convince them to go back with you.  You can basically know the whole lame story of this game before you even get halfway through the game.  I won't spoil the ending for those of you who haven't played the game (even though there's not much to spoil).2. Laws - On FFTA the game has a set number of laws in each location and a judge watching the battle to make sure no one breaks them.  At times you can cleverly use these laws to bind your enemies from doing certain things.  However, later on in the game the game starts placing 3 laws in effect all at once.  This slows down the battles greatly and sometimes the 3 laws could be barring you from healing, using magic, or even using the fight command itself!  Sometimes they even barred me from doing dmg to animals in a battle where I was fighting 5 animals.  These laws end up being more annoying than helpful especially if you're like me and want to build characters to their max lvs and stats.3.  Lack of Sidequests - This game has a huge lack of sidequests or other alternate things to do in the game.  You can accept extra missions from the Pubs but half of them don't even allow you to fight, but rather dispatch a clan member to complete the mission for a certain amount of time.  The extra missions where you can actually fight are often unrewarding and a waste of time.  This game lacks a Dungeon or bonus area where enemies are stronger than the final boss like in the other FF titles (ie. Deep Dungeon of FFT, Via Infinito of FFX-2, Research Cen. FF8, etc.)4. Sound - If you've played any FF titles before then I'm sure you know what I mean when I say that the music on this game is weak.  The tunes on the other games were so good that you would go to some areas just to hear the music and would later find yourself humming the tunes.  However, on this game that isn't the case.5. Difficulty - Square usually tries to balance the FF games.  Not make them to hard but then again not to easy either.  This one falls in the category with the &quot;kiddie game stigma&quot; that plagues Nintendo today.  The game is far too easy for anyone who's played and beaten the other FF titles.  They made this one in order to ensure that all 6-14yr olds would be able to beat this game.Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to a normal RPG fan.  Get this one ONLY if you feel the need to have every Final Fantasy game in your collection or if you're not bothered by the huge number of flaws in this game (I would have listed more if I had more space)."
287594,B00104I5UC,The taste :/,"I love everything in this product... but the taste.It tastes like a rotten arnold palmer.My roommate bought the grape flavor and it has similarly bad taste.Bought Xtend which tastes amazing and now I mix them both just to get the PW down.Amino Acids make your breath smell too. I fast in the morning so basically I brush my teeth and just drink amino acids till noon and I definitely feel uncomfortable with that &#34;dry mouth&#34; breath at work.If you don't mind the taste or the bad breath, I think it's otherwise a great product at a great price."
3108845,B001OMT61W,Enormously Enjoyable,"I bought this DVD because of the previous two glowing reviews, and I certainly was not disappointed.  Au contraire!!!  Anyone who is even remotely interested in Baroque music should get it.  The music and the singing is brilliant.However, this is a baroque opera with very very long da capo arias and recitatives.  As a result it is very difficult to sustain any action.  The singers do their best, and they are all accomplished actors as well as exquisite singers -- but during the time the same idea is stated and restated it all becomes close to a concert performance.  The plot must have been quite original at the time, having been taken up by many other composers;but in our time it does seem a bit hackneyed.However, that is minor carping.  I am very glad I bought this production.  I will doubtless experience it again on numerous occasions.  Take it for what it is:  A glorious evening of excellently performed baroque music.  I am sure that you will be entranced by it."
1878661,B001K3JF7K,Diana Krall should sing standard of jazz,"Diana Krall is a good artist and performer, but the songs she is more capable to sing are jazz standard, as she does in her best albums (""The look of love"", ""When I look in your eyes"" and ""All for you""); bossa nova standards have nothing to do with her music and with anything she has done in the past.Forget this album."

Right away it felt like i was playing a vdeo game i was not familiar ith and then i read another review stating it as written by some other company.  Totally makes sense.For me, a major step backwards (and hardedned edition was total rip off).  Feels childish.  forced to listen storyline I didn't want to hear repetedly (how about an option to skip), the game takes over the controls so many times, feels like big brother taking controller away from me constantly, as if to say ""Well, you're too stupid to handle this part, give it to me.""  friggin annoying.  game was over in two nights of play.  It says i get extra levels because i bought hardened edition.  All i saw was a totally cheesy extra ""zombie"" level.  I felt ripped off -They didn't say it was extra ""zombie"" levels, they made it read like i was getting actual, ordinary, gameplay levels.  NOPE!"

6502,B001CJTE0K,great holster at excellent price,I bought this as a replacement for an Incase leather holster that had finally worn out after two years of use. While this is only a 'leather texture' holster it has a nice feel to it. It's also fits an iPhone 3G extremely well especially if you use some kind of a polycarbonate case. The flap/cover holds quite securely with a magnet. Unless you're someone who wants real leather you might want try this out. The price was so cheap on Amazon that I took a chance and bought two.

1509467,B0086V5TYC,Great Fitness Game!,"First of all, this is my first experience with a fitness video game. I have nothing to compare it to -- my review is based solely on my experience playing this game.Things I like:- Lots of workouts available, from Abs to Zen. (Hee hee!)- The medals keep things interesting. There are tons of them, and they give you another reason to push harder.- The daily to-dos (3 a day) are great for people who need more motivation to get moving -- also great for people who like to check off and complete a list.- The online community makes it possible to see friends' scores and beat them (which you are occasionally rewarded for).- A diverse selection of activities that keeps you coming back for more!Things I dislike (or don't care about):- Dancing. If I want to dance, I'll dance to music without a game. I am not coordinated enough to follow many of the moves. Also, not a fan of the music selection. But this is my problem...hardly a reason to knock a star off the review.- The fitness levels on this game are far too uneven. It should take more effort to level up. I'm already a Level 3, and I've only worked out for a couple of weeks.- The scoring is messed up sometimes. One of my to-dos yesterday was ""Get 90% in any Cardio workout -- I had to redo the same workouts for at least 2 hours just to get that 90% to-do completed.Overall, I love this game. There are a few things I don't understand, but I would definitely recommend this game to someone looking to enter the video game fitness world =^-*=!"

1802621,B006M9NIDO,So disappointed in Gerber...,"I own quite a number of multitools, ranging  from small to large and from several different manufacturers.  I had hoped that the Gerber Dime, coming from a major manufacturer would be of at least adequate quality. However most of the blades are so tight that they could not be opened.  After numerous opening and closing by using a flathead screwdriver I was able to loosen up a few of the blades.  I contacted Gerber and they said they were having a production problem. Probably because they are made in China. I had the same problem with another Gerber multitool a few years ago!  One other Gerber multi tool has worked okay. With two out of three of their multitools being defective I am very disappointed in their company. I find with Leatherman much more reliable.  I contacted Gerber and they are swapping out the Dime for a larger and more expensive product in their line.  I appreciate this but I really just wanted a Dime that worked."
1418978,B001FEO72M,Diehard Naruto Fans will love the fighting system,"I'm almost upset that Ubisoft didn't make anymore Naruto games after this. While the new ones are better overall, there were some amazing things Namco changed about the gameplay. I would say this game is better than any DBZ game I've played, and is definitely in the top 5 for fighting games.The Story:- The story starts at Orochimaru killing the Third Hokage (the tutorial) and follows the search for Tsunade and Sasuke leaving the Hidden Leaf village arcs of Naruto.Pros:- The story mode is sort of like an adventure game mixed with puzzles through various types of minigames and missions. You can make teams of up to 3 including Naruto (He's always on the team because you're him). It's important to pick people who have useful jutsu's for outside of battle (Kiba's beast transformation and Choji's Ball are very useful).- To perform jutsu's you have to weave the hand signs using the left stick for left hand and right stick for right hand (this isn't in the newer Naruto games, but I think it makes the fighting alot cooler)- Ubisoft recognized that the American voice acting isn't exactly the best so you can opt to use Japanese voices and subtitles.- There is so much to do in story mode that it keeps you entertained very well, however I beat the game 100% in under 25 hours. Still it is very fun.Cons:- Since this game has been out for quite some time, XBL is rather dead (the only people who play are Hokage rank and are amazing)- It's a very sped up version of the story and they alter some small things to make it be faster.Other:- I got 900G on one playthrough (the other 100 is XBL, which it's not hard to get to chunin rank which leaves the last 30G for some waiting for other people).- There is no DLCBuy this game if:- You enjoy the fighting genre of gaming.- You are a Naruto fanDon't buy this game if:- It's over $20- You just want achievements."
1647782,B0053EMXKS,ICK!,"If you are looking for the great peanut butter flavor of old fashioned peanut butter logs, DO NOT BUY THESE! These taste awful. Don't know whether they were stale, or maybe stored with something that affected the flavor, or it is just a bad recipe... but they are really bad tasting. Very little peanut butter taste. Taste like they were stored with spoiled fruit or something. The texture isn't right either, they have a hard shell. I would never buy these again nor would I recommend them to anyone else. ICK!"
355988,B002BH4TXE,"Better than the Plug-Ins, Hands Down!",I have tried various home fragrances in the past and am a big fan of febreeze products... When I heard about these I just had to try one out. The scent is perfect for the summer months and it compliments the cool and crisp fresh air very well.It is always better for the kids as you get the essence of a candle without a real flame.Looks awesome and i've already had people compliment its looks and the smell in the room and they are literally shocked when I show them that the scent is coming from this febreeze product!I just love the four hour auto timer (it turns the light off as the batteries do not operate the scent screens.Just like all other febreeze products this one does not disappoint!

When I played the DS version of this game I was very impressed and have beat it repeatedly. When I purchased this game, Me and my girlfriend are constantly playing it and are amazed at how fun it is. A breath a fresh air in a world where you don't really replay games, I have beaten this several times and never once does it feel boring."
3754630,B002BC4N5I,Way overpriced and difficult to use,"To the extent I used it, this wax produced results that are no better than you can get from many other products. I never did do my whole car with it because, applied according to instructions using the Griot's random orbital machine, this wax was ridiculously difficult to remove. After some experiments with application technique, I decided there was no point in hassling with it and went back to my Meguiars. To add injury to insult, Best In Show Wax is a non-returnable product. Now I've got most of a $20 bottle sitting uselessly in my basement. This may be my first 1-star review, but at such a price it's got to be the worst value in car wax I've ever encountered."
3688023,B003C5U2SU,Does a good job but not a full substitute for gravel vacuuming,"This thing does work as advertised, but keep in mind the mesh is about 100 um pore size so it won't catch everything and the water will be cloudy for a while when you're done.  It's great for between full-on gravel vacuuming and partial water changes though and I think it was worth getting.  We use it at least once a week on a 30 gallon that's pretty heavily stocked and planted."

I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
3669611,B001VJ0B0I,OK But Not Great for the Long Haul,"Selected Beneful Original as a change from the dog's old standby, Harmony Chicken and Rice, which he isn't eating as heartily as before. This dog food is reasonably priced BUT looking at the pictures on the label I expected to see assorted veggies higher on the ingredients list.  Corn IS high on the ingredients list and TOO MUCH corn isn't agreeable with my dog's' tummy, and causes poop-issues and sensitivity/allergy.I like that there are added vitamin supplements but can do without the added sugar. The assorted colors and shapes of the kibbles look cute and appealing to this human, not sure the colors make a difference to my pooch. He eats this food happily but it doesn't agree with his tummy which doesn't make me too happy. His abundant paw licking isn't because this dog food was paw-licking good, his food sensitivity/allergy has returned. The food allergy may also cause runny eyes and scratching due to the dry itchy skin and I have to give him Children's Benadryl and Fish Oil like the last Vet visit recommendation.So I'll cook brown rice and mix that half rice/half Beneful and he can get by OK. I'll continue my search for a dog food that is BOTH heathful for the dog AND convenient for me. Cooking regularly for the dog isn't a life goal yet."

So if I am going to order from Amazon, especially as a Prime Member, I need to get them home for only a dollar or two over that price, 9.98 or 10.98 with Prime Free Shipping.  I don't see that.  So these are OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive and is just one of those things you are better off buying locally, I'm afraid.  It's too bad, because I want to put them on Subscribe & Save."

I was pleased with that one, which painted my house multiple times, as well as fences and other big projects.I had this up and running an hour after delivery.  It, like my older unit, works great, applying ample, smooth, even paint across your project.It has a powerful motor, and it draws the paint from your can, so no need to clean a hopper or reservoir, which makes this easier to clean up.Keep your nozzle clean (and a spare one, just in case) and extra filters on hand, and you will get years of use from yours, too."

After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, I just ordered another SKB Fender case.  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips.  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on."

3080817,B001GCUNYO,Excellent says it all,"Last year we had RAMBO and this year we have TAKEN.  In both cases some older guys show today's younger action heroes how it is supposed to be done.Sorry but Bourne holds no candle to Stallone and Neeson in these 2 films.But both TAKEN and RAMBO are more than just action movies... they also have a message about our world today.There is a difference between IDEALISM and REALISM and ignorance is not bliss.Especially in America today Political Correctness seems to have made a large part of our population oblivious to the fact that real evil exists in the world and has to be dealt with.  Instead we have too many people turning a blind eye to so many bad trends and warning signs developing in our changing culture but they choose to stick their heads in the sand and think ""everything will be OK, people are inherently good"".With RAMBO it was the well intentioned missionaries who could not believe they would run into problems in Burma (But Rambo knew better).With TAKEN it is the naive, socially liberal family that thinks they can travel the world without a care (But Neeson's character knows better).In both films, our central character has to rescue our idealistic, naive victims from the harsh realities that truly exist in the world.I wonder how many viewers of these movies get the underlying message and how many only see these as tough guy action films ?"

1695395,B00004S9AI,Overpriced - Not dependable,"I would not recommend this item.  Overpriced and not dependable.  Used this item (turning off/on) under 50 times and it stopped working.  First the problem was sporadic then it stopped completely, and the warranty had expired.  I then purchased a $19.99 remote switch from Home Depot, have used it frequently over the past year and no problems.  Why spend $80 when you can get basically the same item for $20."
1300949,B002DC8OE2,They're not my favorite.....or even close.,"I've been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them. I figured I'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.These were the first to go on, and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on. The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string. They were twice as loud as these. When you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. They don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. The cons definitely outweigh the pros here.Pros:-Very flexible, string bends are easy-Easy on the fingersCons:-The most dull sound of any strings I've ever heard. Especially on the low end. They're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound. The highs are very tinny. Almost sounds like a bad recording.-Your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. It's the weirdest thing. This is especially true for the G string. It's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. Anyways, it sucks. Grip is the last thing you want on your strings.Bottom line: Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be purchased. I'll never buy again. This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings."

1436803,B002EE5ROO,Better than the Last,"If you enjoyed the last game than you will love this one just as much (if not more). There is a lot of improvements to the game, most importantly the save system. Your now allowed up to 3 saves so you won't have to worry about mistakes. If you haven't played the first, you have a set time to complete all missions and before what ever you did couldn't be changed so you had to be careful with what was one save. The other things are more zombies. There is a lot more! They added a combo system which is like the ability to make weapons like in Fallout 3. There will be certain stations that you can go to in order to make weapons. To make weapons you have to level up or find special cards throughout the game. These weapons allow you to gain experience quicker so you can level up your attributes faster.I won't give away much of the story but your a guy who plays in a game that involves killing zombies in Los Vegas. An outbreak happens and you have to go save your daughter and you end up frame. Your whole mission is to find out why and to try to get out of there. When you do this (like the first) you go do side missions of saving people and come across psychos that are tough enemies that often hold people hostage. It helps boost your experience much faster. Anything in the environment is useful to kill zombies. If you see it than likely you can use it. You all can mix up drinks to boost abilities like move faster and such.I have enjoyed this game a whole lot and recommend it highly. It is very fun, has an interesting story, and the controls work a bit better than the last title. This game surprises me. It is much better than I expected. Right now I am at the last boss encounter and can say that the story has some surprises."

1857362,B00005NDZC,no way is this drum and bass,"This is an okay two and half star disc but it most certianly isn't a disc I could find myself putting next to my portishead, hooverphonic or lamb CDs. This is not D n B or trip hop in any way, shape or form rather this is more on the likes of say kylie minogue or really bad euro pop stuff that you'd hear on the dance floor of a gay niteclub.  Not to say that this is bad or anything but it didn't float my boat as far as DnB or trip hop.  Hardly dark at all, full of inane lyrics and the music at times is incredibly cheesy.  'demonstrate' is a cool intro that i liked a lot but alas it's only 26seconds long. 'hide u' is pretty good as well as '(slip & slide) suicide' and 'i want it all'.  If you're into supreme beings of leisure you may like this but raise the cheese factor to the nth degree.  Maybe in a couple of years with a more refined and crisper sound production kosheen could be a bit better but for now I'll stick to lamb and esthero.  On a side note these guys are being compared to Baxter.  Don't believe the hype.  Baxter is definitely on the order of hooverphonic and portishead, dark and twisted full of churning staccato drum beats and woeful lyrics.  Check them out instead and borrow this from your friend with bad musical taste."

1296685,B0002H0N76,"Poor Quality Control, Unsatisfactory Sound","I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar, and will soon replace them.  On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad.  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."

I remember DOOM not because I thought it was a great game, but because the first time I played it, it made me sick and puke because of the visual issue we have come to know from the Epilepsy Warning we see on most games now.  If you feel yourself geting sick stop playing, your brain is having a mild seizure brought about by the way the visual cues are comming to you from game play.I had to unistall and can't play it.

2259539,6303414028,"Worth a look, but...","There are two reasons why I watched this film:1) Because it is included in ""The Ed Wood Box"" set, which has much more enjoyable films (even though they're all bad).2) Because the Tim Burton film ""Ed Wood"" includes the making of ""Glen or Glenda?"" as a part of its plot, and it is great to see how close they got when they showed Johnny Depp, Sarah Jessica Parker and Martin Landau imitating scenes from the film.There are a couple good moments, like when Bela Lugosi shouts ""PULL THE STRING! PULL THE STRING!!"" But the story's narrative is incredibly jumbled, the dialogue poor, and everything about it is barely watchable. It is still amazing that this film even got made. If you think ""Plan 9"" or ""Bride of the Monster"" are bad films, watch ""Glen or Glenda?"" and you'll think the other Wood films are Shakespeare."
1433379,B002BS47YE,Its like stepping down from a ferrari to a jaguar,"Probably not the best exmaple but you get the point. Oh and it also costs more.It still a good game but its not the masterpiece that crysis 1 was. A lot of features have been removed from this game, just to name the most favorite ones:-Power struggle allowed you to become super strong on the battlefield and reduce weapon recoil throw greneades longer distances etc.-Speed is not even half the speed of what crysis 1st nanosuit was. ??? I thought nanosuit 2 should improve upon the 1st one and not downgrade itself....-PHYSICS!! You are no longer are able to blow up a small building or take down trees. The enviroment remains the same upon battle and in the end of battle.-Open enviroment, unlike crysis 1 where you were able to flank your enemy at least 90 percent of time. Crysis 2 becomes more linear leading to alley battles and street battles where your flanking opportunities are reduced to 40 percent during the entire game.-GRAPHICS OH GRAPHICS! Last game made support of Dx10 which increased texture quality in some areas, also giving a greater water quality than what dx9 offered. This game is dx9 and there is no word on crytek for dx11. Nvidia removed crysis 2 on their list of dx11 games supported last week. Which leads me to believe that there will be no dx11 patch in the future.Thats my review you might not care about this changes and still enjoy the game thats fine you gave it a 5 star score. I respect that.However this is my opinion and i give this game a 1 star because I DO MIND the changes made and its obvious that im not thrilled about paying a higher price for a downgrade product. Also im not a big multiplayer fan if thats your argument for why this game is better but i am certain that multiplayer has been doing nothing for me but kicking me out of matches and not being able to join some others while also asking me to re-enter my cd key time and time again."
3257863,B003Y5H4Y8,One of Sam Worthington's best performances,"It took me a while to actually sit down and watch this movie, because I honestly thought it was going to be boring.As you can tell from the 5-star rating, it is anything but dull!Reviews here are mixed, but I found the film riveting from beginning to end, with truly amazing performances from the exceptional cast.Yes, Helen Mirren is terrific, but IMHO, Chastain and Worthington are the real stars.I've seen the former in quite a few movies already, and her versatility is positively astounding. Her turn as Rachel Singer is Oscar-worthy - a beautiful balance of courage and vulnerability.Her on-screen chemistry with Worthington is breath-taking! Every scene they share is electrifying, and the part where they share a passionate, forbidden kiss is absolutely heartbreaking.But Worthington blew my mind as David. I didn't enjoy his roles in Avatar and the Titans films, though he first impressed me in Terminator Salvation.He undergoes a remarkable transformation here. I have never seen him look more tortured or lovelorn. Scenes with Chastain are sizzling hot, while those with Christensen sent chills down my spine.And keep a lookout for the train station action sequence - it's the only high-octane bit in the entire film, but superbly executed.I now have new-found respect for Worthington's abilities as an actor. I hope he'll be offered roles that are worthy of his talent. Get out of the Titans franchise, for pete's sake!"
1867946,B0002IQIZ6,Yawn.,"This is boring, uninspired modern rock (or as Palumbo calls it, party rock) at it's most mediocre.  There is nothing horrible about this record, but there is also nothing good about it either.  Sounds like two bored musicians trying to cash in on the new dance-punk (rock) rage going around, while adding a slightly heavier element to it.

However Ragu contains no corn syrup, so is I suppose better for you, sigh!

1618465,B003GTR8IO,Surprisingly good; subtle; sophisticated.,"It's a total cliche and sounds incredibly elitist, but Starbucks' Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee tastes like the grown-up version of nasty flavored coffees from places like Dunkin Donuts and cheap grocery store brands. Maybe it's because I grew up in Seattle and was therefore raised on Starbucks coffee, but I do prefer the more complex flavor of their brews in general and don't find it overly strong or ""burnt"" as many New England natives - raised with the swell on spout at ""Dunks"" - do.Not to be too hard on Dunkin; their coffee is certainly ""budget friendly""! Actually; the 11oz bags of Starbucks aren't very expensive. In fact, you can get it for the same price, which seems a bit odd to me unless the company plans to raise the price to more traditional ""Starbucks prices"" after getting people hooked- which seems like a bad idea.As for the coffee, it comes ground, which is great for most people; not if you do cold brew.  The flavor - at least for the vanilla option - was light but it was there; I found myself using one less packet of sweetener than I normally do. The scent is also not overbearing, but pleasant.Overall, I'd buy it. It's good, it tastes better than the competition, and it's available for (essentially) the same price."

1847261,B000007UCP,"Very good album,","comparable with Per un Amico. The title track has the most unusual two-minute choral, but it is followed by a heavy-metal-like piece (accompanied by nice guitar work) and it's a bit too heavy, even the good instrumental can't soften it. Is My Face on Straight first sounds out of place with its English verses, but it has a good flute (as well as in La Luna Nuova and Via Lumiere) and is pretty good overall. Dolcissima Maria is a nice tune. The rating is more like 4.8."

3602951,B0002DK2DU,A mess to clean,"After an initial honeymoon period, when the litterbox was still new, therefor, relatively clean, and easy to keep clean, I was very happy with the purchase.THEN, after my cat had about of very loose stools, it became a nightmare to keep clean. The loose poop, which is covered by litter, gets caught in the straining grate. The entire box must be disassembled and cleaned out and it is very difficult to get the poop out from between the bars of the grate.Also, by chance, this weekend, I was watching a show on cats on Animal Planet. The cat expert talked about this exact box and said that it was bad for cats in the very way it is constructed. When you roll the box from side to side to redistribute the litter, the sides get coated with the scent of urine--a complete turn off for cats! (I have noticed that no matter how clean I keep this box, both my cats have been opting for our more old fashioned (and much easier to clean), though less private litter box.Sadly, this box was not a solution for us for easy litter box cleaning."
3760679,B009409K0I,Not for Presta valves,"There are some confusing reviews for this product that made me curious enough to buy it. To clear up the confusion: this tire inflator does not readily work with Presta valves and it does not ship with an adapter, so you will have to get your own adapter. I am primarily using it for my bike tires that are rated 110 to 140psi - my compressor produces about 110 psi, maybe a bit more. Even though this inflator is only rated up to 100psi, I with the 200psi gauge this allows me to check and correct the tire pressure quickly.I tried the inflator with a car tire and noticed that the mechanism that clips it to the valve is a bit unusual (and flimsy/cheap). Air will escape unless the hose is held totally straight and there is no lateral force to the connection. This is a bit difficult to achieve. This is no different when I use it with the Presta adapter. I am not sure I would order this product again."
1669755,B00934S39E,Bummer Product,"I was so excited when I saw this finally become available through Amazon. I went G/F last year due to an intolerance. So, I can technically eat gluten, but just don't feel so good when I do.I love Pamela's Bread Mix and Pancake/Baking Mix. So, when this became available and stated it could be used in place of A/P flour I was excited. I have to say though, I honestly do not feel it can replace A/P flour. I tried three separate times to use this flour. I attempted to make the muffin recipe on the back of the bag, and boy...talk about a dense, rock hard muffin. I am no novice baker. I know how to cook and bake. The muffins were hardly edible. Huge disappointment since the muffins I have made from the Pamela's Pancake/Baking mix have been awesome! Next, I made pie crust.....meh. Again....dense, hard, and dry. No thanks. Finally, I decided to use this flour in a recipe that called for A/P. Crepes! I have a crepes recipe that calls for A/P flour. The batter came out so horrifically gummy and no amount of liquid would thin it out to the appropriate consistency. Needless to say I am really disappointed in this product. On the upside, I only purchased the one bag, so at least I don't have a ton of product to get through. If you're looking to bake some G/F goodies such as Banana Bread, muffins, or pancakes....stick to the Pancake/Baking Mix. That's what I'll be doing."
1672984,B00A0GT9Z6,Did an ok job,"This set did a mediocre job.  It was great at polishing and got a good shine on the glass top but it didn't actually clean anything off of it.  I had to use my straight razor as usually to carefully get the spots from cooked on drippings and wash it with a hot soapy cloth.  Then I used another one of these scotch brite clothes to go over it again and it made it shine and look brand new and polished.  Probably could have been done just the same with a little vinegar on a cloth.  Personally, I wouldn't spend the money on this as there was no added benefit since I needed my old methods to actually make the stovetop clean before polishing it up.  Save the money and use Vinegar to shine it up."
3621249,B000AUJFHE,Cats Go Wild - But Rips Open Easily,"My 2 girls love their banana and have loads of fun holding it in their paws and curling around so their back claws can rake on it.  After a few days, though, one of the seams ripped and I started finding catnip on the carpet.  I sewed it back together and now we only give it to them on special occasions.  They still love it though.Warning - this looks like a real banana, and the brown spot where the cats have loved on it the most makes it look even more real.  I'm always walking through the living room, catching a glimpse of it, and wondering why somebody laid a bruised banana on the floor.  [...smile...]So your cat(s) will probably love it, but it does wear out faster than some other toys."
3644731,B000WHUOEI,Feliway Plug-in,"I don't like the concept of this at all. First of all it is leaky and oily, has to be plugged in at all times. It is bulky and doesn't fit well into the wall. Also it gets very hot while plugged in, which freaked me out. My cats also didn't seem to notice is."
319455,B001E5DZQQ,Feel cheated after buying this and finding out that Connecticut study showed it's worthless. Don't bother.,"Well, I fell for the hype. I've been buying this for a while thinking it would  properly clean fruits and veggies. I will admit it leaves no funky smell or taste like some washes for produce. But after reading that it's no more effective than water rinsing, I'm thinking I can save 23 bucks.The Dollar Stretcher site (google it) has a way to make your own veggie washes easily (they explain how). Consumer Reports suggests a drop or two of dishwashing detergent diluted with water, then rinsing. Other produce sites specify all you need is a scrub brush and tap water and 30 seconds of rinsing. I am now just gone back to the dishwashing liquid method (that I used before buying FIT.) If this product were a couple bucks, I'd buy it for convenience But at 7 plus per bottle--that's outrageous for not doing much more than water alone.For the report, please google up the study title and by:Removal of Trace Pesticide Residues from ProduceAC003 (10/00)Removal of Trace Pesticide Residues from ProduceBy Dr. Walter J.

1810259,B0092LE9H8,All OPS Switches are not Created Equal,"I had high hopes for this switch. Especially since Lutron is in the town where I live. I installed it in my kitchen where it would be nice to walk in and not reach for a switch.Installation was easy. So easy that I almost didn't turn off the circuit to install it. Wire nuts and screws were included, and the switch plate just snapped on. Everything tested okay, except one bulb in my light fixture ceased operating immediately, but I can't be sure it was the fault of the switch. You program the switch to the delay you want with three choices. Then there is a sensitivity option where you press another button to set. I couldn't find the button,so I checked the instructions. It said not to install the switch plate yet, so I assumed it was underneath. Nope.Another look at the instructions said this function was on OPS switches only. But this was an OPS switch. But the button was not there. So I let that go and went about my way.The first thing I noticed was as soon as I got to my bedroom door the thing went off and lit the light. This was about 20 feet away and not even in front of the sensor. Every time I went to the bathroom the kitchen light came on.I decided,to put a piece of tape over part of the sensor.. Effective, but not too attractive having duct tape on a white switch.Now I have a bird in the kitchen, but I hardly thought my caged parrot would set off the sensor,particularly since he didn't move around much. But throughout the night the kitchen light kept coming on. So today I moved the bird to the bedroom, but the light kept coming on. Nothing moving in there.If you are aware, it takes mor electricity to turn on a light than it does to keep it burning for a time. And nothing wears out a bulb faster than turning it on and off. Strike two.This switch is also supposed to sense daylight and not go on during the day. My kitchen is bright, but this feature did not work. Strike three.I saw a similar switch at Lowe's, and it had the missing button, but was quite a bit more money.Another dislike comes from the fact there is no manual override. I like to leave the light on for the birds at night for awhile, but couldn't. Nor could I turn the light off and keep it off, so for a night my parrot had to put up with the light turning on occasionally. And it appears to have nothing to do with his moving, but a malfunction of the switch.Needless to say, my old switch is going back in, and the Lutron switch will head back to Amazon.Quite disappointed in this purchase. Not at all what it should be, or could be."

163940,B00CUKEZ5E,Junk...At Any Price,"I got the chance to try one of these from a friend that ordered two from the manufacturers website.  (You know the kind.  Where you get the second unit for ""free"" with separate shipping and handling.  Always a big mistake). He didn't like it, but figured he would let me try it in hopes that he may be able to recover some of his highway robbery shipping charges.  I have to admit that I wanted this thing to work. It would be nice to be able to attach close by and have it be available at a convenient angle.  And I will also admit that I was pleasantly surprised early on when the suction thingy worked very well in attaching itself nicely to the windshield.  Unfortunately that is where the luxury of this thing ended its impressiveness with me.  First of all the other reviewers here that talked about having to remove any rubber like case on your phone are correct.  They don't of course mention it in the commercials, but they do on the product instructions.  The surface of the Grip Go requires a hard surface to stick to, or work.  But in reality, it doesn't.  Work that is.  My phone, with the case removed and all kosher and everything fell off within 10 minutes the first time I used it, and continued to thereafter at regular and shorter intervals.  It fell off going over bumps, when reaching for it, and sometimes when it just took a notion too all on its own. Every time.  Very aggravating, and a total and complete waste of money.  Needless to say my friend was out a sale, and hopefully so will this seller when it comes to you.  Avoid, it's junk...: )"

In case you are new to the series, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Marty McFly is down on his luck and one night, his friend Dr. Emmett Brown introduces him to the world of time travel. When Doc is shot by terrorists, Marty takes the time-traveling DeLorean and accidentally goes back to the year 1955. Marty seeks the help of the young Doc in order to get back to 1985. He meets his parents, and causes his smokin' hot mom to have a crush on him, rather than his dad. He tries to get them to fall in love at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance before he disappears from time. Will Marty get back to his time and make his parents fall in love?

Though DaVinci bottles are the same size as Torani bottles, these pumps have a longer feed tube that comes closer to the bottom of the bottle.  That's not huge, but the messiest part of the process is when the bottle gets almost empty. So it really is nice.  The gold color looks great with both.  The dispensing angle is a bit tight to the bottle making it hard to distribute over the foam of a large cup... which I like to do.  More than you want or need to know, huh?"

1366328,B000B7Q4CU,Fun gameplay and amazingly funny references,"Amped 3 is the first snowboarding game to come out for the XBox 360. You get to fly through the snowy slopes in full wide screen high definition.First, it's important to fully accept that this game is made very tongue in cheek. You get cut scenes with drawings almost exactly like Trogdor, you have sequences of 60s-style circles with good/evil George Harrisons urging you on. You get modern alt music mixed in with Blinded By the Light. Sometimes there are Wonder Woman style flashing lights. ""The Dueling Serpents of Fangar!""A lot of the references might go right by people who aren't both classic TV watchers and new website visitors. It's amazing how many subtle funny things are built into the dialogues and cut scenes.But back to the game. You customize your character - male or female - with the typical array of skin color, body build, hair, facial hair, hat, clothing, board and so on. You have a GIANT mountain to explore that you can explore, do challenges on, follow the storyline on, and just have fun. If you get tired of tracking down cool places to board, you can always snowmobile all over to find a new hidden spot.Like any game, the key here is to master the controls. Once you get the hang of the different moves, you'll be carving, spinning and sliding whereever you want to go. Dodge in the trees. Launch out over the rocks. The mountain is fully rendered and waits for you. The game is pretty forgiving for beginners, so they don't get frustrated, but also provides enough challenges that skilled boarders will find their ways to have fun.The graphics in widescren high def are a mixed bag. On one hand, I love the groomed rippled snow and the trails you leave in it.  It made me want to put aside the controller and drive up to the ski lifts. The funky stars and circles and other indicators are all true to style. The clouds and sunsets in the background are photo-realistic and lovely. However, the character models are a little plastic looking. Comapred to other games we're playing right now, they weren't up to standards.It's important to note that the game is about fun - not about training you to be a professional snowboarder. If you slam into a tree, you don't get hauled off to the emergency room. You just bounce off and keep going. If you take a nose dive you just roll and get back up again. I don't really consider this a bad thing in a video game.Well recommended for snow bunnies everywhere!"

Harris shaving soaps.This isn&#8217;t being said to brag but to show my background to review this razor.This new system is generating a lot of comment in the wet shaving community, being a real advance over the standard back & forth movement.Adding side to side movement does improve the shave.I get a closer shave with less &#8220;do over&#8221; spots using this razor.Additionally, their seems to be less chance to nick yourself.This is a weighted balanced handle with holding spots in the right places.Blade life is comparable to the Mach 3 giving between two and three weeks per blade.Overall, this is an excellent razor and worth having."

I tried the mic with other cables I have lying around that I know work, and I got nothing; it was like the mic wasn't plugged in at all.  And the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked.  I still tried it with a difference mic... static.I can't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.The stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package.  I was impressed at how much of is *isn't* plastic.Still... I can't recommend this product."
2483485,B00005JL99,Violent social commentary,"In near-future Japan, a law has been passed which requires that a class be randomly selected, fitted with explosive collars to ensure compliance, and released on an island with instructions to battle to the death.  Some become killers very quickly and easily, while others resist succumbing.  This very dark comedy follows the experience of one class and the students who beat the system.Director Kinji Fukasaku, who was in his seventies when he made the film, juxtaposed the uniquely Japanese cliches of ""pure"" youth and chirpy cuteness with brutal ultraviolence to comment on a society in which the generation gap has reached an  apocalyptic level: this is a world where the older generation's feelings of resentment, shame, and guilt toward the younger results in a hatred and fear of its own children.  This film's satiric intent is underscored by the irrationality of the so-called ""BK law"" itself; it is never explained how forcing one group of students to kill each other each year is supposed to benefit society.A very interesting extrapolation of current trends in Japanese society."

When I applied it, the tape was extremely slippery and a little difficult to get it to stay where I put it. I'm hoping that is because I got it too wet. When I removed my hand from where I placed it, the tape wanted to come off stuck to my fingers. I did get it mostly where I intended. And it was hard to reach spot where I applied it. When I use it again I'll update my review. Other than that, it's a decent product and should last me a lifetime however long that will be. Lol. It is now 5 months later. This tape is coming off in each place I used it. Try a mesh tape, it works better."
1864614,B0000AGWGD,Are you kidding me?,"This cat is like Fat Albert with the greatest singing voice this side of Hasselhoff. Please don't misread that to think this guy can touch Hasselhoff, he's close which is about as great of a compliment as you can give. Track one, oh my freaking goodness. I've been sorry in many years like in 87 when I got a C in geometry, in 90 when I didn't try making a move on Amber, in 94 when Jen wanted to hook up and I went out with my buddies instead, but I've never heard anything like Sorry 2004. Ruben sounds like a total whining baby that just keeps saying I'm sorry over and over and over and over again. One would think that would be enough to ram your head into a desk, but Ruben makes it sound so dang sincere that I was sorry too for the whole misunderstanding. The rest of this disc is the greatest R & B album ever, but none of the tracks can match with lead single. It's like the 85 Cardinals, Coleman and McGee were so good that the rest of the order kind of let you down. Ruben never lets you down and Burger King had better not let Ruben down or you'll hear ""Burger King sorry 2005"" on his next album. This guy is the most talented Fat Albert lookalike in the universe and he'll make your dreams come true if you follow him as your savior."
3625847,B000FH708I,diffuser,I bought this after talking to a friend about a kitten i got at the shelter. She was 8 weeks old when we first found her in that cage and i just had to have her. I have had cats all my life but this little one got wilder the older she got.when she was about 6 months old we got a puppy. Ginger tried everything she could to try to get ahold of that puppy.  We decided to try this product and it seemed to work until the thing started smoking in the outlet.  Needless to say we won't have one again. They did offer a replacement but I'm too afraid to try another one so they did return my money.
2649342,B0000AGWSC,TOTAL RIPOFF,"To anyone thinking that this collection might include newly remastered widescreen versions of the films, it DOES NOT.  Instead, 20th Century Fox has assembled a shameless repackage of the original non-anamorphic discs for films 1 and 2.  The transfers look like they were done during the infancy of standard def, which means quite lousy.  They couldn't even include the recent Family Fun Edition of the first film (which is remastered).  I didn't bother checking films 3 and 4 because it's obvious this is a cash grab for a surplus of the original discs, which have been collected before.  The outside box doesn't even bother to tell you the specs of the films (probably anticipating a reaction like mine).  Nothing new here except the packaging.  Whatever department head gave the green light to this attrocity is in the wrong line of work."

Not only do you get 3 of these for the price of one Spigen, but they fit perfectly, came with everything you need (cleaning cloth, dust stickers, instructions), plus they come in a nice package.  I can't speak to durability, but my S-Pen left numerous superficial scratches across the &#34;swipe to unlock&#34; area of my phone on the Spigen, so I wouldn't be surprised if these do the same eventually.Even if they do, the lifetime guarantee means just having to send it back to the company for a replacement!

However you have to remove the phone out of your case in order to connect it, and I also discovered that the second/spare battery charger in the back did not work or hold my spare battery in place (which was the real reason I bought this in the first place - to be able to charge a spare battery the same time as my phone). So I had to return this. Too bad, because it would have been a great phone charger and holder had it worked. It is overpriced for just a single phone charger."
1537294,B0001IOSCW,I was surprised there was no lactofermentation involved,"When you make this kimchi according to the instructions, you essentially are letting the cabbage soak overnight in brine, then draining it and mixing in a packet of ground spices before sticking it immediately into the refrigerator to let the flavors marry. This is NOT the same thing as fermenting a batch of kimchi for days at room temperature so that those wonderful fermentation bubbles build up and render the special ""tang on the tongue"" that I realized (after making this) is critical to good kimchi.I also found the flavor strange, too sweet and also a little ""off"" in a way I cannot describe. I didn't weigh my cabbage, but I selected a standard-sized Napa head so it had to be in the ballpark of four pounds. But the flavor of the packet overwhelmed the cabbage completely. I wound up rinsing off as much as I could, then stuffing the cabbage back into a mason jar and putting it under airlock on the counter to see if I can salvage the batch. The verdict is still out.I'm not a kimchi purist or connoisseur, but I know enough to know this isn't what I like. I'm going back to Sandor Katz' technique fromWild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foodsand see if I can't get closer to something I can't stop eating. Maybe I can work some of this product into the recipe somewhere along the way and it'll be magic, and I do hope this is the case because I've got 11 packets left."

1877513,B0015D3Z3A,"Very good, indeed! 4 stars","I'll get straight to the point:  this album is better than 12 Songs.  Rubin and Diamond hit their stride on this one.  Home Before Dark is stronger in terms of songwriting, delivery, as well as the arrangements.Some seem to dislike the stripped down sound as compared to the full productions of the past, but for those who are partial to the very early releases  of the sixties and early seventies (especially the Memphis recordings), this is a welcome addition to a great American songwriter's legacy.For listeners of Dylan and Neil Young-- who are themselves admirers of Diamond-- don't hesitate to buy this one."

The graphics had taken another noticible cut and 5 on 5 was a waste of time... but I did like the feature allowing you to draw your own routes, so it wasn't all bad.Madden 10 is all bad.For Madden 08 and 09, I made the mistake of reading reviews for the PS3 and XBox360 versions.  I made it a point to focus only on the Wii versions and I was appalled to see what the Madden Franchise has become on Nintendo.  I decided not to buy it before renting it first.  No Franchise mode, no weather (elements or otherwise), the players look absolutely ridiculous, there's no sidelines, the stadiums are a joke, and did I mention there's no Franchise mode?EA should offer roster upgrades for Madden 08 and fire every incompetent employee responsible for Madden 10.The $4.50 I spent to rent this game was more than it's worth."

1879594,B0028Y5MY0,Imogen does it again,"Describing Imogen Heap as an eclectic and talented musician is akin to saying Michal Jordan was a pretty good basketball player: a vast understatement. Since her days as the front woman forFrou Frou, Imogen has done nothing but grow as an artist, vocalist, and composer. With an uncanny, near perfect-pitch voice, classically trained musical skills, and the ability to give electronic riffs evocative emotion, she is without equal in her field.Ellipse is proof that she continues to grow and learn, something that prodigies don't always do--sometimes it's easy for them to just coast. Not so for Imogen: ifSpeak for Yourselfwas both beautiful, nerdy, witty, and occasionally wantonly silly, Ellipse is nearly all of those things with the exception of silly; it is melancholic, yearning, sad, haunting, and ultimately lovely and satisfying on several different levels. It's great pop music if that's what you're looking for, but it's also a complete artistic work that pays off the careful listener. Imogene's song writing has always been about the revealing moments of life, and Ellipse has the same focus, deftly portraying homesickness, lost love, the power of art, etc., all set to her particular brand of homespun indie electronica and sung lovingly.Ellipse is not significantly different from SPEAK FOR YOURSELF in either a good or negative sense. It shows progression and perhaps even a maturing, but ultimately it's Imogen doing what she was born to do: tell stories through song with electronic beats and synth sensibilities. The result is an album that is easy to embrace for new and old fans alike, and one of the most unique and desirable releases of 2009.5/5 Star. Fantastic music. A must buy."

1301807,B003QTM9O2,"Not ideal.  Lower fork too narrow and small, bad design.","I bought an Ibanez Concert size uke.  The body is 2 inches wide (less than the 2.75 inches stated for this stand).  My uke does not fit well in the stand.  Why?  The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow, and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke.  Thus, any uke that is concert size or greater.  So, most ukes don't fit well.  They fit, just not well.I did, and you will likely need this advice, remove the bottom fork, turn it upside down, and reinstall it (no tools required).  Now the ""curve"" of it is upward, and the uke better sits on it.  The fit is improved.  Not great but better.  One stand can't fit all instruments, but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars.  This small stand does not hold most all ukes.Although its neat how it folds up, like the video here on Amazon reviews, it is very heavy for its size.  This is not a lightweight stand.  At all.  Surprisingly heavy, and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag, trust me.I wish I got the Hercules standHercules GS402B Mini Stand. All Hercules stuff is superb, and my friend has one for his uke and says it's sublime (I don't own it, myself, so I just present this so you can research it and it's reviews on Amazon). I own other Herc stuff, and it's all ideal, and for a few bucks more, I could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one.  Oh, well, for once, I got cheap.  And got burned for it.All in all, not great, this tiny stand.  One stand fits NOT all.  Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments.  You may think you can bend the lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the Amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all.  It's just an imperfect design. My take on it, your mileage may vary.  Bye bye."

1765564,B00203U69K,Overseas Trading Group,"I ordered the Ridgid 88387 Power Spin last September, as a gift to a relative living in another state. As the relative did not have an immediate need for the cleaner, she did not open the box. I visited my relative last June (8 months later) and opened the box to discover that Overseas Trading Group had shipped a different (manual crank) drain cleaner, without the ""Power Spin"" feature, which was the main reason I purchased the 88387 Drain cleaner. As the cleaner the seller sent is new/unused, I requested to exchange it for the one I had ordered. The seller refused, due to the 8 month time elapsed since the purchase.I understand that 8 months is too long, and that my relative should have opened the box upon receipt. What I cannot accept is that Overseas Trading Group shipped a manual cleaner instead of the Power Spin I ordered. That eroded my confidence in puchasing online. The one star rating reflects my experience with Overseas Trading Group.I purchased the Power Spin for myself prior to the above incident from another seller, and wrote a review for the product."

1880126,B002OFWFZM,"Hopefully She's Not GONE For A Long, Long Time!","You have to give Carly Simon her just dues...after what was arguably one of her most prolific decades to date, you would think she just might kick back and relax for a bit. I mean, over the last ten years we've had a batch of eclectic, albeit brilliant, originals (2008's THIS KIND OF LOVE), 2007's soothing INTO WHITE, a reunion with Richard Perry in 2005 (for the lush standards collection MOONLIGHT SERENADE) and 2000's extremely personal THE BEDROOM TAPES. A break should definitely be in order, right?!? No way!Instead, Simon chose to wrap up the decade with NEVER BEEN GONE, a stripped down reimagining of many of her famous hits. Raw and unadorned, NEVER BEEN GONE is an important record for a number of reasons. First, it shows just how strong a songwriter Carly Simon really is...these songs are as powerful now they were thirty to forty years ago. It also shows what a true artist is...unafraid, vulnerable, honest. There are moments here when Simon's voice doesn't come across nearly as strong as on the original version, but, hey, that's cool...very few artists can say they do! At 64, Simon has earned he scars...and her accolades!Opening the disc with a relaxed version of ""The Right Thing To Do"", Simon sets the mood from the get go. Switching things from a piano based arrangement to an acoustic guitar one allows for a more easy-going vibe, which is only enhanced by ethereal backing vocals. Simon's lead vocal is slightly ragged, but that just adds to the overall effect, resulting in a comfortable groove.""It Happens Every Day"" is one of the songs that benefits most from it's reworking. Originally a more subdued, sad reflection on and of loss, there's almost a lilt to the new version. Yes, it's still about the pain caused by the end of a relationship, but there's more wisdom present now, the knowledge that life DOES go on. This is all captured in a gorgeous lead vocal by Simon. One of my two favorite tracks off of NEVER BEEN GONE.The disc's title track experiences one of the more...unique...reworkings. Originally a hushed, almost religious, effort, the new take has a swaying, waltz-like feel to it. As Simon sings ""The wind is coming up strong and fast/And the moon is smiling on me"", the listener is totally transported to another time and place. Absolutely lovely!""Boys In The Trees"" is, without a doubt, my favorite cut on the album. There's a hypnotic urgency to the track, what with it's captivating arrangement, gorgeously layered lead vocal and haunting harmonies, courtesy of John Forte and daughter Sally Taylor (Why, oh, why has she stopped recording?!?!?). Everything about this version is sheer perfection....love, love, LOVE it!!I've never been a huge fan of ""Let The River Run"" ~ I've always thought ""Coming Around Again"" was much more deserving of the Oscar ~ but this version kind of grows on you. Starting out slow and acoustic-y, it builds in intensity, but never goes over the top the way the original does. In fact, this version is much more...spiritual. Nice!Simon's reworking of ""You're So Vain"", along with Matthew Sweet's and Susanna Hoffs' cover earlier this year (without a doubt the best thing about their UNDER THE COVERS VOL. 2), proves the song is, as stated by Rolling Stone, one of rock's Top 100 Greatest Songs. More primal and a lot more vicious, the energy just spits out of the speakers. Simon's lead vocal is equal parts gritty, growling, cryptic and crisp, while the arrangement is clever, but never cluttered. I guess you CAN go home again...and enjoy the trip!""You Belong To Me"" is almost a miss for me...it's way too ""lounge-y"" for my tastes, lacking the sly, sexual heat of the original. However, Teese Gohl's stunning piano fills and some gutsy backing vocals lift it out of the ""loser"" column and put it smack dab in the ""O.K."" one (I would have really liked to have seen this one tirned on it's head, be it thru a Country, dance or rock take).""No Freedom"", the first of two new tracks, is a fun little ditty, and a direction I'd like to see Simon move in on future recordings...quirky, edgy, spirited. However, she almost gets lost on her own album...this is just as much a Ben Taylor cut with Mom on backing vocals as it is a Carly Simon track with son Ben guesting. Cheers for believing in your offspring, Carly...but this is your record!""That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be"" is the only cut on NEVER BEEN GONE that doesn't work at all. While most of the songs benefit from added age and experience, ""That's The Way...."" is all about youth and starting out and the accompanying doubts. The arrangement pales compared to the original, while the lead vocal is shaky. I know she had to include the song, but I would have much rather had a percussion-driven version of ""Jesse"" in it's place.""Coming Around Again"" gets off to a rocky start, with a lead vocal that's pinched and nasaly. In fact, it's almost comical. However, the arrangement is delicate and fresh, and how can it NOT tug on your heart when Simon sings the words ""I believe in love...What else can I do?"" Simon's vocal rights itself by song's end, particularly on the powerful outro....""If I can just breathe""....wise words.""Anticipation"" is as touching as ever, but it's overall vibe is kind of flipped...while the original is all giddy and hopeful, this new take hints at inner doubts and uncertainties. And, yet, it still works. And Simon's lead vocal? WOW! From growl to purr, it's up front, forceful and focused. Definitely one of the disc's high points!Rounding things out is ""Songbird"", a song Simon first started back in 1970. Coming across it 39 years later, she polished it up and finished it off. A pretty piano ballad storysong, Simon's 1970's vocal nicely segues into her 2009 one, showing where Simon has been, where she's at, and, hopefully, where she can still go.And that's the true magic of NEVER BEEN GONE...Carly Simon is a classic artist who's still incredibly relevant. Here's hoping she won't be GONE for years to come! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for not only including the lyrics, but also commenting on why she chose each song, and how the reworkings came about. Kudos also for the cover artwork;VERY un-Simon, it's clever and fun!)."

1781694,B003KYT7ZM,Comfortable and quiet,"This American Standard Champion 4 was a spectacular upgrade to our previous toilet seat. We had an older off-brand seat made of wood composite material and the outer white coating was coming off in some areas. In addition, just a bump against the toilet would cause the lid to fall - LOUDLY, often at 3:00 a.m.What a switch - and a joy this seat is. It is literally impossible to slam the lid or seat down on this Champion 4. If you pull the seat and/or lid away from the tank a few inches and let go, they will make a steady, slow descent to the porcelain bowl without a sound. Seriously. Not only will the seat not make any discernible noise on the porcelain bowl, the lid makes no sound when it rests on the seat.Despite the slow-closing mechanism, this does not mean you cannot raise or lower the seat and/or lid quickly when needed. With a married couple, the seat goes up and down many times a day and no one wants to wait 'to go' because the lid is not in the proper position.There is a reason that American Standard is the Cadillac of toilet seats... like their name, they set the standard.The installation was a bit different than any toilet seat I have ever installed. I'm not a plumber, but over the years, I have changed seats here and there and most of them are a no-brainer. Even following the instructions, I was a bit stumped at first. The plastic snap-on covers over the hinge screws are optional on conventional seats - but not on this model. The beauty in this seat is that it is a quick-change seat. Simply snap off the plastic covers and the entire assembly comes off for extremely easy cleaning. If a NASCAR pit crew were to design a seat - this would be it!The adage ""you get what you pay for"" definitely applies here. I have gotten cheaper seats in the past, and have always ended up regretting it because the surface ends up degrading, the hinge ages quickly, and the seat ends up being uncomfortable. I had always lamented that toilet seats in public restrooms were often more comfortable that the one I had at home. Then I realized that a public restroom toilet seat has to be better quality to withstand the inordinate amount of use it has when compared to a home environment. Quality does count - and this toilet seat and lid are well designed and thought out."

I got around 3 1/2 hours consistently. That's 1 hour less than specs...Still the product remains at 4 stars.----- ORIGINAL REVIEW ----------A friend located in the US did the favor to order them for me and then I paid him for it... but I received those without the Charging case even though the order is supposed to include it (currently being investigated) and probably related to vendor so...As of the product I must say that I gave a lot of thought and reviews-reading before buying those, I have had the Backbeat 906, 903 (I alternated use when battery died) and 903+ (a small upgrade) all with good quality, but after a couple of years of using each of them the plastic around the ears hardens and break easily... While I waited for them to arrive I wondered:1- Will they fit my ears comfortably?2- Will they sound bass-less?3- Will they arrive damaged?4- Will they fall out of my ear often?5- Will the battery last less than advertised?After a couple of day I can answer the following:1- Luckily, they do fit my ears comfortably but I need to adjust them and rotate it a couple of seconds first (Medium tips)2- They do lack some bass (I was used to always set Extra Bass feature on my BackBeat 903+ by holding play/pause button, but this feature was not carried to the Go 2 headsets). However the sound quality is a lot better than my old 903+ and the lack of bass can be a little bit compensated by the EQ on my phone. And personally, I don't like too heavy bass songs (with some exceptions)3- I received them in perfect conditions, and hopefully they last more than my Backbeat 906, 903 and 903+.4- I read a review where the poster advised to loop the cable around your ear, and after a day of using it (according to manual) and having them falling out often, I decided to give the loop a try... and I found out that if I make the loop on both side bigger (thus shortening the extra cable behind my head) the headsets actually stay in place almost under any conditions!!!!! I was going to use them for rock climbing mostly, which does not require sudden movements but now I can assure that those can be use for running, jumping and probably head banging!. If you have problem with the extra cord yanking the earbud or making noise, give the loop a try... if they simply do not fit well in your ear canal, this will not help much5- Finally, the battery seems to be fine, I now don't have the same music needs I did when I was in school, so I mostly use them for the office and a little bit of exercise... I haven't measure the battery with a clock but I will.... the first couple of cycles seem to hit the nail at ~4.5 hrs of music... I will updateI recommend everyone getting these earbuds to install Headset Battery Meter and Find MyHeadset apps by Plantronics... both apps are helpful."
1837561,B000002KZR,my homework was never quite like this ........,"The hit songs on this album stand out quite a bit from the regular album tracks.  &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; is a scorching sonic assault.  &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;Panama&quot; were huge hits, deservedly so. The synth driven &quot;I'll Wait&quot; showcased a different side of VH. A great song with a good beat.The rest is less impressive.  &quot;Top Jimmy&quot; is  a David Lee Roth overdose.  I always skipped this track because I couldn't stand to hear about Top Jimmy, how he cooks and how he swings.  &quot;Drop Dead Legs&quot; has a great beat and is the best &quot;non-hit&quot; track of the bunch.  &quot;Girl Gone Bad&quot; is not a great song, but &quot;House of Pain&quot; rumbles with intensity.

2717383,B0002DB5MC,"Smoke Cigarettes, Say Nothing in an Artful Manner","This movie got some rave reviews from film critics when it was first shown here in New York. As a result, I began watching the DVD with high expectations, and, boy, what a letdown!I found the film hard to follow.  There isn't much dialogue and it is often hard to tell what's really going on.  The film is about a young woman named Vicki who smokes cigarettes, smokes cigarettes, and then smokes more cigarettes.  Besides smoking cigarettes, she lives with a real loser who is unemployed, smokes dope, and abuses her. (He looks a bit like an Oriental Christopher Walken.) But, you see, every time she leaves him, he finds her and begs her to come back, and, instead of telling him to take a flying you know what, she...goes back to him! In between her live ins with the loser boyfriend, the film almost becomes interesting for a brief moment when she ends up dating a member of a Triad who perhaps (it is unclear but implied) kills someone and flees to Japan.Because of the lack of dialogue, there is no character development and so it is difficult to care about the characters in the film.  Vicki ends up seeming to be quite a pathetic creature - albeit a fairly sexy pathetic creature.I thought there at least might be some interesting sex scenes, since Vicki is played by former soft core porn star Shu Qi, but you can forget about that.All in all, the film is a real snore.  I'm giving it two stars instead of one, however, because of the artful cinematography, and because Shu Qi looks really sexy with all those cigarettes hanging out of her pouting lips.  As another reviewer noted, the film has style but almost no substance.  This film artfully states nothing in particular."
1507696,B007XVTR12,Orginal Black Ops was better for PC,"Unfortunately Activision has killed the PC version of the COD franchise.

The biggest insult was COD 1 and 2 were originally fantastic WWII single player games with multiplayer a nice extra feature you could play if you wanted to.I know there is some rudimentary skill involved but for the most part its run around with your head cut off spraying and praying hoping you can level up to the weapons that shoot 1000 rounds per second. I sarcastically joke there. Sniper guns are pretty useless due to the map sizes/confinement. The majority of the maps I've played so far in Blops 2(lvl 21) are way to small. The weapons have become corny to me with how fast some can shoot.As a FPS PC gamer since Wolfenstein the genre on the PC has fallen to it's lowest with the latest COD releases. All so Activision can make a quick buck. Devs, please don't put console style play on an advanced gaming platform. It makes you look lazy and uncreative. You've done nothing but take away PC features and charge us more for a rinse and repeat game series.Give me back my local LAN play and online servers browsers as we had back in the day. Give me back the great single player it used to have.I will not buy another COD game at this point if they continue on this path. My LAN group no longer buys COD titles as of COD Modern Warfare 2. I know Blops 2 made a ton of money. I hope gamers eventually wake up and realize they deserve so much more game features and uniqueness for the $60 Activisions charges for their games.Check out Planet side 2. Now that's a multiplayer FPS game you can dig you teeth into and its free unless you want to pay."
1756298,B001CKYZW6,Better than the old 18V,"This works better than the old 18 Volt Milwaukee batteries.  This charger is more versatile than the old one I had.  It does both 18 and 12 Volt batteries.  It is not backwards compatible from M18 to 18V , connector is different."
1875825,B000NVIXFK,Another bad medicine,"I buy Rush records since 1984, maybe earlier. I own all of their albums and many bootlegs from the various gold eras of the band. Each album Rush record I immediatly go and buy it, because I love the band. Each time hoping in the deep of my heart that the album would give me some of the thrills and joys Rush gave me in the past with true masterpieces. Unfortunatly, each time in recent years I ended up being VERY disappointed. Frankly this thing is boring me. Now each time I see a new Rush album on the shelves I think ""Gosh, ...another album from Rush ... I know I'll not like it, I feel it, I fear it ... they are 20 euros in the trash, ... but I Know it, I have to buy it ... ok, let's drink this medicine ..."" and I buy it. But this is not the way one should buy an album from a band he used to love so much. This music Rush is recording recently has no ispiration at all. The last three studio albums are mediocre. MEDIOCRE. This album makes no exception, it is flat, it is the same from the beginning to the end. And you can listen to it, one hundred times, it still sounds the same. Flat. The texture are nice, the sounds are nice, the album is well produced, but one thing lacks terribly: the music. Geddy is singing the same line over and over again for the entire lenght of the album. What a boreeeeeeeeeee! But did the guys listen to what they record before the release? Obviously the guys plays well like they ever did, but it is what they play that doesn't work. I don't want to point out specific tunes because they really sound the same. It is almost incredible, but it is. Glory days unfortunatly are gone. By the way, nothing last forever, we have to admit this magic band has nothing left to give. But there's one good news for me. Luckly, for the next five years I'm okay, .... til the next bad medicine.... march 08 ... and now, what is coming next ladies and gentlemen? ANOTHER DOUBLE LIVE ALBUM, OH YEAH!!!! Another live album Just a couple of years after the mediocre Live in Rio ....!!!! Yes it is exactly what we needed, another double cd live album, Rush never recorded Tom Sawyer live infact!!! A live album after just ONE album! Oh my friends, I'm sure I'm going to hate this band that I used to love so much!"

There aren't exactly an army of amazing Vita games out now, but this one is good on it's own, not just relative to it's competition.

No baby could handle this.This is a very fun game with incredible Dreamcast graphics.  The music makes this more suspensful and more fun. the gameplay is sweet and the puzzles can confuse and frustrate you.  Play online or with a couple of friends.  (of course you can play by yourself)So, if the name is stopping you from buying this game, don't let it.  I did until my brother bought it and now I always want to barrow it.So, don't be fooled by the name and don't miss out on this incredible game."
3761963,B00H72YG9U,towel leaves fuzz all over car,"This Zwipes set comes with very nice squeegee-style blade as well as a single hand towel.  The blade does a great job of getting most of the water off of my car.  It is soft enough that I don't worry about damage to my paint.  It removes water in streak-free fashion and then you're ready to finish up with the towel.The towel isn't so stellar.  It didn't seem to hold much water, and, more importantly, it left blue fuzz on my car.  Small pills of fuzz appeared after every few wipes.  When I got done, my clean car was dotted with little blue pieces of the towel.  I guess I'll have to get out the blower and blow them away.While I give thumbs up to the squeegee, any towel that leaves a mess on my car isn't something I'd buy again."

1297520,B0007L8BQW,Realistically ... What Do You Expect?!,"Barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do. I do however question whether the word ""Pro"" should apply to this system. Although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer, the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system. The signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about. To its defense, it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.After playing with the device for a couple more minutes, I noticed that any movement whether I kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and I moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception. Even the length of the mic cord, whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality. YIKES!!! Perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which I previously described above. I'm afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes. I'll probably be returning this unit asap."
1298188,B000CZ0RLU,Totally worth it!,"I can't believe I'm giving a 5 star review to a Behringer product, but they got these right... I replaced a way-more expensive Audix condenser mic with these, and they actually sound pretty darned good. If I crunch one or if one breaks, I'll just get more at this price. I have other Behringer mics laying around, and they all kinda suck. These are totally fine."
1883101,B006M4RN3U,Great Fallow-Up Album!,"Fun.'s first album was really great! I love their unique style of music. This album takes it up a notch in my opinion!

2837470,B000BW7QWW,Firefly fans only,"The decision on this movie is simple.  If you are a fan of the Firefly TV series, you must see this movie.  It brings to conclusion several (but not all) of the long-term sub-plots introduced in the series.  If you are not a fan, this movie is just so-so because you won't understand why certain events and interactions are significant without knowing the character development of past episodes.If you have never seen the Firefly series, consider getting into it.  It's that good.  For just under $20 I bought the entire series as a collector set from Amazon in late June, 2008.  On four DVDs it's the entire single season that aired and was tragically cancelled before anyone knew it had begun.  The Firefly series and its conclusion movie Serenity are a wonderful combination of the action-packed sci-fi/space and western genres - all presented with witty conversations, wonderful characters, and hilarious situations that have viewers literally laughing out loud again and again.To better understand this recommendation, pick a favorite TV series with funny characters.  For illustration, I'll pick Everybody Loves Raymond.  Now imagine the charcters buy the space ship equivalent of a yacht and travel together to remote planets so early in their settlement they resemble western frontier territories.  Even if the plot, special effects, and action made a first-rate movie, it's the funny characters playing it out that would make this hypothetical movie tremendously entertaining.  Using my example: when Marie and Debra Barrone argue about cooking in the ship's galley, and then Raymond gets a larger slice of pie than Robert, it's a lot funnier if you already know those characters from the TV series.The Serenity movie is similar to the example above.  It's OK in its own right, but tons better if you know the characters from the Firefly series.  It's a little worse in the case of Serentiy because the setting requires some Firefly background to make sense.  A Star Trek movie wouldn't make complete sense if you hadn't watched the series enough to understand that Klingons are always war-like, Romulans routinely use cloaking devices, and the Federation is guided by the Prime Directive.  Firefly similarly creates a universe setting with its own ""rules"", and the Serenity movie just can't take the time to explain it all again.In conclusion:1.  If you've watched Firefly, buy the Serenity movie.2.  If you haven't watched Firefly, buy the Firefly series and then watch the Serenity movie.  You'll be glad you did, on both counts.3.  If you haven't watched Firefly and won't follow #2 above, then don't buy the Serenity movie."

3761345,B00B7GC50Y,Great for the intended purpose to keep a battery topped up,"The biggest concern someone would have in purchasing a device like this is its practicality both in installation and use, and the overall results. Is it worth purchasing a $35 solar charger to maintain a battery? If you have a vehicle, or sit down mower, or motorcycle that is used infrequently especially for longer periods of time it is a very worthwhile investment. Running a battery all the way down to being totally uncharged is not the healthy procedure for maintaining the overall life of a battery; not to mention having to take the time and inconvenience in order to recharge a battery before using a vehicle that isn't on a trickle charge.The challenge that confronts us is how to mount it in such a way that it can get juice to your battery without having to remove the battery from the vehicle or wind up with the hood open a crack creating a trailer park scenario of the car with the hood open hooked up to a charger.The beauty of the NOCO BLSOLAR5 is that it comes with two hookup wires. One is the typical battery hookup with two clamps that would go directly on the battery poles. The other wire is the cigarette lighter adapter which would feed your car battery without even having to lift the hood. So for the ultimate in convenience you could just place the solar panel on your dashboard facing your car toward the south, or underneath a side or rear window where the sun rises and sets and get a good charge with only the cigarette lighter plug in attached. If you wanted to use the car there wouldn't be hardly any inconvenience at all simply unplugging it and moving the solar panel aside.The other practical use would be if you have a shed housing your garden equipment such as a sit down lawnmower you could attach this solar panel outside through the 4 mounting holes on each corner and run the wire inside. You can hook it up using the battery charging clamps wire and forget about it for the winter.Now onto practicality in terms of price and return on investment: solar panels have a life expectancy of about 20 to 40 years. Without going into the formulas I accessed regarding how much electricity a typical trickle charger uses, the results were a range of $1 to $3 per month. So you should expect to recapture your investment in this NOCO Solar Battery Charger in 1 to 3 years of constant use. Solar panels having a 20 to 40 year life expectancy beyond that makes this a no-brainer in the long run; if it were 40 years at $3 per month for a regular trickle charger that would be $1440 added to your electrical bill. You also have the advantage of being a go-green supporter considering that no fossil fuels or nuclear fuel was spent in making the electricity.So let's add it up. It will pay for itself many times over in the long run. You have the convenience of keeping a battery topped up so the vehicle, motorcycle, ATV etc. is always at the ready, and it will preserve the life of your batteries which aren't cheap by keeping them topped up. Great idea and glad to see solar hit a price point that makes it very practical. Highly recommended."
3743697,B00068XCQU,buy a different brand updated 1-15-2014,"I own several vehicles and motorcycles and I had one of the pre china battery tenders and it lasted for several years. it did so well I bought 3 more of the battery tender pluses at one time at Christmas 2010.one worked for about 9 months and then would not go into the float mode. It killed the battery from overcharging. hooked up the next on a different battery and it worked about 2 weeks before doing the same thing(not going into float mode).  the 3rd one lasted less than a week........... each has a 10 year warranty so I phoned deltran and spoke to their ""tech"". he cannot understand my problem........ tried on different batteries. plugged into outlet first blah ,blah ,blah. I paid over $100.00 for 3 of these Chinese junk chargers.I can send them back and they will check at my cost if nothing is found wrong I would be charged a service fee and return shipping. poor customer service ,bad quality. for what these cost they should last.Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy these battery tender chargers........Update: 1-15-2014 buy an xtreme charger......I have 3 of the red xtreme charger, see my review ........"
336105,B001J4HB1C,Flents ear plugs.,I have used these ear plugs for years. I am so happy to have found them on Amazon as not one store in my area carries them any more. I have small ear canals and these stay pretty secure and block out a good portion of the noises that bother me. I am very pleased with this purchase and the order was shopped very quickly.
3750708,B000WN5F96,Great addition,"I installed this with a Whisper King pump and accumulator kit.  I'm not sure of how each of the components performs on their own, all I can confirm, is that when you install the Whisper King, the pump silencing kit and this accumulator, you'll achieve the performance you're looking for and the system is very quiet.  I'm guessing, but I'd say it's more than half as quiet with this set up."
407759,B003YDOO2K,No no no,Junk. Not accurate. Seller claimed it was new and I got it and it smelled sweaty and was definitely used with someone else profile information in it. A male!! I never used it. Was disgusting. I could literally smell the sour old sweat. Made me nauseous.

2310228,6304458657,HORRIBLE. IT IS A STINKER!,THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO WATCH IN YEARS. TERRIBLE ACTING. HORRIBLE PLOT. BAD MUSIC. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME.

333466,B001GIOV1O,Great Shave Cream,"I'm really particular about shave cream. I shave in the shower and prefer tubed shave cream. Burt's Bees is among the best -- certainly on a cost per ounce basis. I like Aveda best, but it costs $29 for one tube! Cream by The Art of Shaving is also great, but costs $20/tub, and the top is hard to get off and back on while in the shower with a razor in one hand. Rite Aid's RS brand (the cream, not the gel) is very good too, but they never have much in stock. Kiss My Face is also good. I really like Burts Bees, though, and no one has (recently) called me a hippy. The key to using a tube cream is not to use too much -- a very thin film works best. Also, shaving in the shower really works best -- the Toilet Tree shower mirror is the bomb. Further, if you've got some money to burn, or a birthday coming up, The Art of Shaving carries a Gillette fusion razor with a built in light -- $150 but it's one of those little luxuries that can make life very pleasant. Back to Burt's Bees... try it, you might like it."
3695396,B003YLETZY,Low Quality,"I bought two of them since I have two dogs. They came in two different packages, so I could only assume that there are two different SKUs. They both had the same design, so it is also possible that they are the same device. This is not the problem though.First, they use 9v batteries which with moderate use (typically during 45 minute walks each day), they seem to die out in about a week. I assumed the first battery as a low quality which died nearly instantly, but even with a brand new good battery, the remote seems to eat the battery juice as if there was no tomorrow.One of them constantly loosing the prong cover. The first two times, the collar was indoors and I was eventually able to find it. However, the third time, the prong cover was lost forever. On the second collar, the actual device that sits on the next broke on one of the walls where the leash is attached. I sent an email to the supplier with no response.This too me is completely unacceptable. So, about 3 weeks after I purchased it, I have one that works with a missing prong cover, and therefore only take one at a time out for a walk since I am trying to condition them to walk properly, this means my 45 - 60 minute walk now comes to almost 2 hours. A waste of money, and I would like to think that I just had to bad straws, but with no response from the shipper, I feel as if I am basically SOL, and a waste of $80."
1689146,B0000223XY,Terrible design,I purchased this design over a year ago.  You have to push the hose through the opening and clamp it into place from the inside.  You can fix this with sealant and pipe or like I did with duct tape which will leak.  I recently found another one at Woodcraft that is made much better and has fittings that you clamp the hoses onto.  Brilliant!Save yourself a major headache and disappointment and buy the one from Woodcraft.

1505536,B007MM9E42,Too hard for young kids.  Should be rated 10 and up,"Just fyi.  We bought this at Christmas time.  It is not really for young kids.  It is a difficult game, despite the Disney label.  I would say Age 10.  My 5-8 year olds had a difficult time.  I wish we had not spent the $20 on it, but for$14 it might be worth the frustration of finding out on your own."
3749780,B000NPR33O,I was not as impressed as many other reviewers.,"Lots of glowing praise on this item and while I agree with most of the comments like great leverage, good in tight spaces, easily adjustable, long reach... and so on... it failed me miserably on the first use. I had a filter that was not ""hand tight"" as many expect them to be when they're ready to slide under and twist them off with just a light touch of pressure. The filter on my 1999 Expedition is right behind the bumper so I'm not sure if that placement exposes it more to the elements and makes removal more difficult or if the filter was last replaced and tightened way too much... last change was by a Ford dealer because it was a freebie. I clamped onto the top of the filter and it immediately punched holes into it with the claws that are suppose to grip the filter... and then came the oil down my arm. I tried again at the base of the filter where there's a little more metal and immediately got another set of holes. I went for the strap wrench but that wouldn't budge it either. I finally got it off with my KR Tools 12153 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliers. I know all filters aren't difficult to remove but I've been changing my oil & filters... plus most repairs... for about 50 years and this is not the only filter I have had problems removing. I will be purchasing a cap type filter wrench and have given this wrench 1-star because I could not get the filter off with it and it punched holes in the filter... and since this tool is pretty much useless for any other job it'll likely be donated or just sink to the bottom of my auto tool drawer. I don't care about the holes as much as I did the resultant oil leak or the potential that the filter may have to be removed in pieces. I'm also surprised that one reviewer talks about holes and how this wrench didn't cause any in the removal or install... and I think anyone who tightens a filter with a wrench is asking for problems. I have purchased quite a few TEKTON tools on Amazon from wrenches to sockets and have not been disappointed... until now. Lastly, if your filter is on tight you should be able to exert enough pressure with a tool to get it off without punching holes in it.Since I was able to get it off with the pliersKR Tools 12153 Pro Series 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliersthat would seem to be the better tool investment if you have a large filter... at least the jaws have more teeth for a better grip, the teeth are not likely to puncture the filter, it has a lot more potential for other uses where an oil wrench does not and the price is about the same. I have used the pliers on many other things without an issue or damage to what I was working on... especially good for my 1-1/2"" PVC irrigation and pump lines."
3705338,B004QLX0LA,Doggie Does not Like Rachel Ray Dry Dog Food,"Since it was free, I thought I'd try Rachel Ray's Limited Ingredient Dog food. My dog has not liked the other Rachel Ray dry dog food flavors at all. She will only eat this dry food if mixed with wet dog food (the Rachel Ray Turkey wet food she liked).My pup is a rescue and will eat just about anything, including raw vegetables, but this - she leaves in her dish until either starving or I mix it with something else. I have tried adding water & heating it, no go.In contrast, my dog will eat ""Ol' Ralphs"" dry dog food which sells locally for $20,00 for a 50 lb bag. Even though this product was free, I cannot recommend it."
3677436,B002GPEM9C,not really jumbo and too thin,"The bags do not compare to other brands in the jumbo size category.  They are not that big, and were adverstised to buy together with the &#34;Catit Jumbo Hooded Cat Litter Pan - Warm Gray&#34; pan.  The bags do not fit that pan.Additionally, they are so thin that they rip.  Can only use them to either fit a smaller pan, or to collect the poopy from the pans to throw away."

3621423,B000AYB4VK,"Sturdy, and Doesn't Cut My Hands","Hemp Leash, Medium, Apple Green / B000AYB4VKI bought this leash for my 4 month old, 14 pound puppy, to go with the matching collar (sold separately). My puppy loves to pull at his lead and I didn't want to buy a small harness since he'll just outgrow it in a few months... and the medium harness just hangs on him so far. This leash and collar, though, are a good substitute in the meantime.The fleece on the handle is very soft and gentle and I no longer feel like I have invisible cuts on my hands (unlike the nylon lead we were using before). I was concerned that the fleece/hemp leash would get dirty easily, but so far it still looks like new, even after having been dragged through some mucky water one day. The hemp leash is thick and sturdy and - surprisingly - I feel that my puppy isn't pulling nearly as much as before. And when he does pull, I don't worry so much that he might hurt his little neck, since the collar has fleece to cushion him a little.The leash seems a little shorter than the nylon lead we were using, but I prefer the shorter length because it gives my puppy less leeway to pull all over the place. Our walks have been much more enjoyable, both for me (less pain and pulling) and for him (less neck pain, and he seems proud of his 'big boy' leash). I love the green color and the eco-friendly materials and I recommend this leash as a wonderful upgrade from those cheap nylons.~ Ana Mardoll"

2925428,B000LE16Y4,I am so thrilled,"I have been patiently waiting to see The Wild Wild West produced on DVD for years.  I spent my teenaged years watching The Wild Wild West every week on CBS.  Since we didn't have a colored TV, I could only imagine the colors I was missing. I had no idea how much blue Conrad was wearing! The colors were so brilliant and enjoyable on the DVDs.  The most popular guest starring actors of the day made the rounds on this show.  It's so much fun to see them again so young. Victor Buono, Carroll O'Connor, Even Samy Davis, Jr. and Richard Pryor.I was sad when Ross Martin died of a heart attack. It became unlikely they would ever do a remake of the show.  The on screen chemistry Conrad and Martin had could never have been replaced by another actor as Artemus Gordon. The movie made a few years ago was a cheap shot for a fan of the orginal show.I haven't seen these shows in over 40 years  I loved every minute of them. I especially enjoyed seeing Michael Dunn as the infamously funny Dr. Miguelito Loveless again.  I was terribly sad when he prematurely died before the end of the series of a heart attack.I admit, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't get Bob Conrad back to give a description of the episodes  as they did on the first season. But such is life. I am thrilled to have these shows s a part of my collection. I look forward to season three and I recommend these to anyone who fondly remembers James West as much as I do."
3703286,B004J1JPUC,Wow!,I bought these for my two dogs for Christmas so they haven't tried them yet (I'll update later when they do) but I wanted to comment on how HUGE these are. These could easily cost $25 each in a store for the size they are. I anticipate my dogs to gnaw on these for a long time (they could smell them through the package they came in & are very excited to try them out...).Amazon also said their ship date would be today and I could expect them by the end of the week and/or next week. Obviously they came super quick.Now to see how the dogs react on Christmas day...

If you have the new Eminem cd Sticky Fingaz is on that album.  That's where  I first heard of him.  Then my friend loaned me this cd and I know who he  is and he is one of my favorite rappers.  My favorite songs are tracks 4  and 16 but I fell in love with them all.  I love these guys and so will  you.  SHUT EM DOWN!  Buy this album the next chance you can!

When I tried to insert the tube into the unit, I realized that the opening at the side was not the one to use for battery operation. (Later I found a slip of paper in the package that told me to use the opening inside the cuff storage section.) There should have been a sticker attached to tell me to do this first. I liked the partially formed arm cuff...since I had a recent shoulder injury and had found it difficult to use the cuff on a previous monitor. I think the unit is accurate, and am pleased with most of its features."

1484151,B00503NANQ,A TEN MEGATON BLAST OF FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ask myself when was the last time I had this much fun playing a game? I honestly don't remember, but it's been a long long while. The breathtaking graphics, the whimsical music, the ingenious game design, the challenge it offers, the variety of characters and landscapes, and the magical controls are all done to perfection. They just don't make games like this anymore! That is an absolute shame, too! Don't me wrong, I love me some FPS's and open world RPG's, but don't we have more than enough of those? Even enough if we could get 3 or 4 games of Rayman: Origins' ilk every year I'd be giddy with ecstaticism. There are few too many sidescrolling 2-D platformers...If it were up to my vote, I'd give Rayman game of the year. But that's not going to happen. The huge budget, adult oriented games such as Batman and Uncharted will take that coveted award. Nothing against those games... I love'em both. However, Rayman will be heavily overlooked because it's going to be looked at as a kiddie game and because we as gamers have shrugged 2-D platformers aside in favor of ultra realistic FPS's and RPG's. With the exception of Mario titles(which have largely become 3-D) and a yearly crappy(usually) Sonic title we don't ever get any platformers. So, here's my vote that we get a new Rayman title every year.If I were say all the things I wanted to say about Rayman: Origins and about how amazing it is I would go well beyond the 1500 word review limit. If you even have the slightest interest in 2-D sidescrolling platformers you should buy this. I will say this is a challenging game, but not so much that it makes you want to break/throw the controller. It gets more difficult towards the end. It's kind of ironic that many will view Rayman as a kiddie game, but most adults will be humbled at the challenge and ingenuitiy it presents. You know, I'll retract that statement I made earlier: I don't care what genre of gaming you like or don't like and I dare you to not love Rayman: Origins. How is that for a bold statement?!I haven't played through all of Rayman, yet. But I think I'm close to the end(the sea level) and according to the back cover there are over 60 stages to play through. Sounds about right. Tons of replayability and fun to be found here, folks! If Rayman can't get game of the year, then it gets my FUN GAME OF THE YEAR AWARD. A perfect 10 out of 10 five star game!"

2977682,B000TLTCT0,Neglected gaslit noir,"Really excellent visit to two rather obscure Fox ""A"" pieces that seldom seem to make it to tv, at least before this release.HANGOVER and THE LODGER aren't really horror movies in the usual sense, but Gay 90's melodramas with big over-the-top, hambone performances from Cregar at their center. HANGOVER has a great score by Herrmann which reportedly was the inspiration for Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD.I really liked both of them, but had a real fondness for HANGOVER. I saw them tv in the 60s and always wanted to catch them again. Cinemax showed the both in the 80s, but they have been little seen since. The fox movie network showed LODGER a couple of times, but I requested HANGOVER a million times and came up with nothing.Presentation is superior. Picture quality is fine, and there's supposed to be a stereo makeover, but you'd never notice it. The commentaries for both are excellent and are done by people who like and understand the films, a rare occasion, these days.The third film is of little interest except it shares the same director. It's old dark house junk, not worthy of inclusion, otherwise.Calling them ""horror classics"" is a misnomer for sure. The two major titles would fit as noirs as easily as anything; dark, black and white, psychotic people doing wacko stuff. Recommended."

2371288,6305958181,Ghost Dog crap,"This may be the single worse movie I have seen in my entire life.  The story is pathetic, the dialog was terrible, and the acting was even worse.  Or was it the other way around?  One of the many things that bothered me was that there were extremely long pauses between every dialog.  This movie is just unbelieveably painful to watch.  Its about this fat guy who lives in the ghetto who, after being beat up at the age of 19 decides to read a samurai philosophy book, and becomes a ""ghetto ninja.""  First he's a contract killer for the mob, then he turns against the mob which consists of the head bosses watching the roadrunner cartoons in every single bleeding scene that they are in.  And its not that the cartoons are background noise, its four bosses sitting at a square table staring at a 9 inch black and white television watching Warner Bros. cartoons.  If this isn't enough to make you want to ignore this particular title, then maybe this will, IT SUCKED!  If you buy it it will be a waste of you $..., and if you rent it, it is a waste of $....

1409831,B00175GC4U,It's Official: THQ has offically destroyed the WWE video game franchise,"Let me just start off by saying that I've been a WWE fan for most of my life, and still fondly remember the WWF Attitude era has a teenager. I've also bought every single Smackdown vs RAW game since it's 2004 series debut. I have done so, every year, merely because, despite how many flaws THQ had in the game, there was at least ONE thing that made the game salvageable. And now that THQ has done away with that one thing, I can honestly say that this series is no longer worth YOUR time and YOUR hard-earned money.The original ""WWE Smackdown vs RAW"" game was an average wrestling game, that had a lot of improvements over it's predecessors. Frankly, both 'WWE Day of Reckoning' games for the Gamecube were better than it, though.""WWE Smackdown vs RAW 2006"" remains to be the best in the series today, as it had far greater improvements over it's last title, had great action-packed gameplay, had over 100 different match types including the Divas' Bra & Panties Match, had a stellar Story Mode with good, realistic WWE storylines, had an in-depth Create A Superstar mode, had PPV Mode, and introduced the first ever General Managers (GM) Mode.""WWE Smackdown vs RAW 2007"" was our first disappointment as it mainly had a huge amount of bugs and glitches and mistakes and problems with it that ruined more than 50% of the actual gameplay. The storylines were terrible at best, the General Manager's Mode devolved into being worse than it was the year before, and the introduction of the new control stick scheme was something that many gamers today still aren't willing to get used to. The game was a major step down from ""2006.""""WWE Smackdown vs RAW 2008"" was a major disappointment too, mainly for it's very limited roster (13 prominent WWE Superstars missing), it's limited customization, and the fact that the game series was STILL no better than it's 2005 release. Despite fixing some things up, like greatly improving it's Control Stick control scheme to be more comfortable and easy to use, the game still lacked any new or exciting features and managed to limit or prohibit just about everything Creation or Customization wise. They had destroyed all possible wrestler movesets and decided to repackage them as ""Fighting Styles"" which were done to hide and celebrate the fact that THQ were giving the least available options for a wrestler's moveset and in-ring abilities in any 'SmackDown vs RAW' game to date. The Create-A-Superstar's options for physical looks were improved, but without a cheat device like a Codebreaker, it was impossible to accurately give them stat attribute points. Why THQ decided to make this so, I'll never know. The WWE 24/7 General Manager's mode was the weakest to date, and even LOOKED bad, with it's new visual display. More rules and restrictions were put onto it that took out all the fun of actually wanting to play it. And with the constant timing and continuity mistakes and glitches involved in WWE 24/7 Career Mode, you often found yourself getting confused about storyline messages you were recieving, that were related to preparation of matches you had just finished. On top of that, the writing was just horrible. As bad, or possibly worse, than the 2007 game's opaque storylines, that could NEVER happen on real WWE programming. To add insult to injury, both SmackDown! and RAW brands had identical storylines in 2008's game, despite the last two games remedying this very problem! And the storyline matches themselves were ill-conceived and unexciting to play through. In fact, the ONLY thing that made 2008 worth playing over 2007 was it's new ECW Extreme Rules match..And now, we get to ""WWE SMACKDOWN! VS RAW 2009"". And every single problem mentioned above still persists to this very day. This game, I can honestly say, isn't even worth really playing, let alone renting. It's the same as 2008, only with even less to offer. If you do want to play it very badly, then by all means, DO NOT waste your money on actually buying this! Even if you rent it, you'll soon find out how this title could possibly be the biggest disappointment that the Masters Of Disappointment, THQ, have to offer.*** Gameplay ***Exactly the same as 2008's, only with even less moveset options and the Superstar Abilities, more or less, gone. This time, you actually have to EARN the ability to do such things that just two short games ago were standard for EVERY single wrestler or diva. In short, it's just like the SvR franchise: it's the same, but worse.*** Story/Career/Season Mode ***This year, THQ decided to give specific storylines written for specific wrestlers. Good if you're a fan of that one guy, but bad for EVERYONE else. Sure, ""WWE 24/7 Mode"" was a bad idea, but at least, ANYONE you used or created in the game could actually go through it. The idea of a seperate Individual's own Story Mode and a seperate General Manager's Mode was an idea no one thought was bad, and thus, never needed fixing in the first place. And yet, we will probably never get that again with the way THQ seems to give us ""More of Less"" every year with these titles. 2007's game will probably be the last of the Season Mode & GM Mode formats.And since I'm bringing it up, I should mention that there is No General Manager's Mode in 2009's game. I repeat: THERE IS NO GM MODE!!! So, once you play through all of these horribly-written storylines for each of these superstars, (HHH, Taker, Cena, Jericho, CM Punk, and a Batista/Rey Mysterio tag team) there is quite literally nothing else to do in the game, but play exhibition over and over and over again.General Manager's Mode was never what anyone would call ""perfect"" since it's 2005 debut, but at least it was there. At least they were trying. Scrapping it altogether is the sole reason I decided not to keep this game and why I am urging you not to waste your money on it, either. And even if you didn't play that mode and kept playing the single superstar mode in 2008's game, you don't even have that option, either, as the single star storylines given here are very short, very uninspired, and like I said before, just poorly written. HHH's is the only okay one and each storyline takes place after the Royal Rumble and lasts until Wrestlemania, putting each of them about two hours long, at the very most.*** Create Modes ***This is a 2009 game. We have Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 technology. We can do just about anything with these consoles. And yet, in a 2009 wrestling video game, we STILL cannot upload our own music onto the game, we STILL cannot have any previous-game-to-current-game technology letting us upload our old Created Superstars into the newest installment, and we STILL cannot even have any real (or useful, if they ever decide to actually do it) downloadable content. In 2009!!!I, like many out there, am a CAW (Create-A-Wrestler) fan. Every year, I've filled up all of my slots and memory cards with Created Superstars. And even though it was a hassle, I even managed to Re-Create my favorites onto every, single newest 'Smackdown vs RAW' release. With 2008's title, I had to use a Playstation 2 Codebreaker just to give them attribute stats, and just to make GM Mode not suck so much that I couldn't make any matches on it or let anybody, including women, be champion title holders. It was a lot to do, but I did it for enjoyment of the game's sake, and to fulfill my own imaginative side. But I shouldn't have had to do so much JUST to make a WWE wrestling video game enjoyable.Why THQ -who has admitted the Create-A-Superstar mode as their most popular feature- continues to limit us to what we can do and how we can do it, in a game WE bought with OUR own money, continues to boggle my very mind. To put it shortly, the few Create Modes left in this game suck, and Re-creating your favorite Created people from the previous games is not even worth it this time around. It's not like you'll be able to really even give them attribute stats, anyway. Maybe one of them, if you actually decide to do the endless ""Season Mode"" portion of this game, which is just an endless series of exhibition matches. So, just listen to me and save your time by not doing it. Especially since there is no stage for your performers to even act out in, being there is *NO* General Manager's Mode! ""WWE Day of Reckoning 2"" on the Gamecube had these same limitations, but at least, their game was... fun!I should also probably mention that the Xbox 360 version of the Create A Superstar mode, is in the Metric System! That's right! Feet and Inches and Weight in Pounds are now Centimeters and Kilos! I'm an American. I'm not from Europe. So why does the North American release of this game have the Metric System in it? Why??? Why does THQ do anything stupid in their games? If there's one good thing to say about the Create modes, then it's that the Created Superstars clothes are now more of ""3D"" objects than the paper mach&eacute; layers of ""clothing"" that they've always been since the WWE Create-A-Superstar's debut. However, this is all ""too little, too late"" at this point in time. Should we be proud that THQ finally decided to give us ""actual character model clothing"" instead of ""2D layers of skin that look like clothing"" this late in the game?I also wish I could say this time around, they decided to finally give us a 'Create-An-Entrance-Video' mode in Create-An-Entrance, only the ""Highlight Reel"" as it's called, is only useful for online gamers to look at, and absolutely nothing else. Um... why give us a ""Create-An-Entrance-Video"" option if we can't actually use it for any Created or Real Superstar's ACTUAL videos??? Have you ever noticed how THQ makes me ask so many questions that shouldn't even need to be asked in the first place?They also have the new ""Create A Finisher"", but I'll get to that later.*** Graphics/Music/Presentation ***Once again, the game looks like crap. Even on Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Although the Nintendo DS version looks surprisingly good. Of course, most gamers are willing to excuse bad visuals if the game is good, but this game is not good, so it will not be excused. Some superstars end up looking good and lifelike, while others, look not a single thing like their real life counterparts. Most likely, this is due to them using differently talented artists on different superstars. It would've been much easier for them to just use their one good artist on EVERYONE, but alas, this is not the case.The music regarding Superstar Entrances and such are okay and standard fare, but as far as a soundtrack goes, this one is one of the worst, yet. No big surprise though, right? SvR 2006 probably had the best soundtrack in the series mainly because half of all the songs were original and made specifically for the game itself, but even that soundtrack was just ""okay."" But this year, the music is so bad, that once again, I had to Mute all music on the game's audio options just to not have to hear it.The presentation style of the game looks weak. It's rare when I complain about menus and selection screens in a game, but this one warrants it. Plus, I don't want to have to look at John Cena's bare body every single time I navigate the game's menus.*** ""New"" Features ***In a game series that has mastered making foolish consumers pay for less of something every single year, they sure know how to fool you with the actual ""new"" content. The three new things they are 'hyping' this year are the new Tag Team format, the new gimmicky Inferno Match, and the new Create A Finisher option. All of them suck. It's that simple.The Tag Team format is probably the best out of these three, here. It's basically more of an emphasis of the cooperation needed in order to make a tag team work. But it's nothing impressive, at all. The Inferno Match isn't even on level with 'ECW Extreme Rules' from '08. It's a gimmick, and not even an accurate one, at that.The Create A Finisher, as I might have pessimistically guessed, sucks. I'm sure though, it would be near impossible to please everyone with the mode, THQ manages to once again disappoint, by giving us an incomplete, unfinished version of their new Create-A feature. It starts you off with many options for a finisher, but with each new step given, your options just about literally are cut in half. So by your third or fourth option in making your own finisher, you are left with virtually nothing useful or creative. To emphasize this point, you will find it virtually impossible to make already EXISTING finishers by using this poorly made new mode! Want to make a modified F-U? Well, good luck trying!*** Overall ***This game is just more of the same, less of the good, and none of the improved, as the last THREE titles have been! It really is a letdown to me, and really makes me wish THQ wasn't holding tightly onto the reigns of the WWE Gaming franchise. With a severely lacking Create-A-Superstar mode, and NO General Manager's Mode, or anything to possibly replace it or have in-place of it, there is zero reason for me to own this game or even recommend it to the good people on this website. Even if you didn't like all the aspects of the ""WWE Universe,"" there at least used to be enough customizable content to create your own WWE Brand, and run it however you wished, with your own fully created Roster of wrestling talent, made up of your own WWE title belt champions. The fact that even THAT no longer exists warrants me saving my money, hoping to help you save yours, and hoping that you heed my words carefully and AVOID THIS GAME.Even if you never used the Creation modes, then even still, this game is a rental at best, as the poorly concieved Storylines given in this title will only last you a week or two, at the best. In a 2009 game, only giving the gamer an Exhibition Mode and a few very short Season Modes and virtually nothing else, is utterly inexcusable! If all you're going to do is play Exhibition and then play, a handful of ""specially made"" individual storylines, which only last about two hours each, then WHY even bother spending forty to sixty dollars on this game? Don't.In fact, the only reason I did not give this game a [One] is to not come off as a biased WWE hater-just-to-hate. I am giving this game a 100% fair review and the fact that the game can give you at least a couple of hours of enjoyment with your friends as a rental and nothing more, warrants it at least being worth Two Stars. But my disappointment in these THQ-made WWE games makes me feel like giving this latest title a [Negative Five]. I can honestly say that this game, is no better, nor worse, than that very disappointing ""TNA Impact"" release, if you want to call THAT a ""game.""Until someone else other than THQ (The Horrible Quality) and Cory Ledesma at THQ makes these WWE video games, I will not continue to buy them and support them. With 2009's release being a joke, almost to the point that you think that literally and are hoping that they have done this just to make their upcoming ""Legends of Wrestlemania"" game look good by comparison, it kind of makes you wonder about WWE fans, in general. Most of them are white males with a lot of disposable income, and if you don't have to even try to make a good game, just how many of them will buy it, regardless?Yes, the WWE has that kind of power, to draw in people to buy their products without even thinking twice about them, but when you continue to fail every single year, us as gamers, have to step in and say, ""No more!"" Say ""No More!"" by not purchasing this title and by not supporting below-quality WWE video games every single year. Much like the WWE continues to lose fans and viewers without WCW or any other wrestling franchise to give them any true competition (sorry TNA fans, but it's true), the WWE will continue to put out programming so bad, that SmackDown! is getting 1.5 ratings each week. And the same thing is true with THQ as, as long as no one else owns the rights to WWE video games, we will get garbage-quality gaming like this, with only the bare minimum effort, if any, put into it. Maybe IF enough people stop buying, THQ will start actually caring about what they release each year. But that's a pretty big IF.This game is horrible, not worth your money or time, and should be avoided altogether, if possible. Stick with the older SvR games, or stop playing WWE video games, altogther. Those are your only two choices when THQ messes up on a scale like this.To sum it up in three simple words: ""This game sucks."""

3748166,B000EDUTWM,Looks cheap and DOES NOT Hold ... Disappointing.,These looked descent when put up in my travel trailer but where on the floor the next day ... then on the floor the day after. the double sided tape sucks on these and needs a more heavy duty industrial type hold double sided tape.When put up you can see the white double sided tape form the side and it looks a bit ugly.Not impressed at all and bought different organizers from camping world that look WAY better and hold perfectly and are flush.Was past my 30 days return so I sold these on eBay for a few bucks ... lost 90% of my original purchase price!I would never buy these again.But all depending on the surface and for the price I guess they would okay for some if they would hold.Not for me and my trailer though.
3585568,B00008AJH9,Worked great for outdoor cats.,"We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions, then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;, I was AMAZED to find that, 15 hours later, heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way, so that it emits a low heat all night through."
1349830,B0001OK7VW,Final Fantasy?  Who needs that now that we have this on GC!,"I have edited this review after finishing the game. (...)A long time ago, the tree of mana whithered away because of a ferocious war that raged across the lands. A hero gave his life to save the tree. This so grieved the goddess of mana that she left for the heavens asking her angels to awaken her for if she slept the world would whither away like the tree. Thus the angels job became to guide the ""chosen one"" to the heavens so that she/he may awaken the goddess and regenerate the world.  Now A young girl named Colette the Chosen One, has recieved her calling and she must journey to regenerate the world.  Her Best friends Lloyd (the main Character of the game), and Genis decided to go with her to protect her.The plot starts off feeling eerily similar to Secret of Mana.  Not only that it seems like a cheesier version of that to begin with.  But as you delve deeper into Lloyd & Colette's journey it starts to come into its own.  This game has depth.  It deals with issues of politics, religion, discrimination, & friendship. There are many twists and turns all supported by a brilliant & complex cast of characters.  Further every so often you have the option of following conversations between your characters as they journey which help add more depth to their characters.Now on to the graphics & sound.  The visuals are gorgeous. The Colors are bright, and the locations are lush. The animation is smooth, and after some major events you are treated to a hand drawn anime cut scene. The sound is pretty good too. Characters taunt and chatter as they battle.  You can also hear them recite incantations as they cast spells. The music is nice but I felt the game lacked that one memorable piece that every single final fantasy (FF) game seems to have.  My major complaint with the sound is the voice acting is pretty cheesy.  It has its strong moments but for most parts I think it could have been done a lot better.The Battle System is awsome. You can see enemies on the overworld map, or in dungeons. They will chase after you but you can avoid them 85% of the time. Once you do fight, it's a lot of fun. You can move around the field, choose a target and execute attacks. Its almost like SOM except cooler.  You can jump to avoid attacks, or block if you wish.  Further you have techs (magic attacks & skills) that you can execute, and you can unleash combined attacks on enemies using your party for super damage. And lets not forget combos!  You can string together techs to hit the enemies a huge number of times.  My highest is 72 hit combo but if you link your party's attacks properly you could go higher.  Your party members do a pretty good job of fighting along with you, and even using techs (spells) to heal you etc.  You can customize their behaviour using a myriad of options to set AI priorities for each of your team members.Ok some negative things now.  I think one thing that this game really lacks is that its missing that one great event, like the opera house in ff6, or the ballroom dance in ff8 that really made those game memorable (atleast for me).  I wish there was that one great scene that I could go back to my GC, reload the game and watch over and over again.  Regardless the game is still amazing and memorable as a whole if not for one event.  I would highly recommend this game. It is a lot of fun. (...)  Stop reading and start buying!"

None are showing signs of arthritis or joint problems and have no problems jumping up onto windows or cat furniture.  But I saw this product has Omega-3 and figured it would be good for the cats.  I give them wet food as a treat every couple of weeks and added a small squirt to their ""tuna"".  One cat is a bit picky, one will eat just about anything and the third is a chow hound.  Of the three cats NOT ONE would touch this stuff!  They wouldn't even try to eat the wet food and leave the salmon oil.  And the cats seem to like fish flavored treats/food better than any other flavor.  I tried this a second time and they still hated it.  I put it out before going to work in the morning and it was all still uneaten when I returned from work.  So I can't tell if this product is effective, but I was dismayed when not one cat would touch this product."
1835499,B000002IWQ,Rockin' hard.,"Rush was never a band to stagnate. As they constantly explored new directions, one Rush album was never completely similar to another, although their preceding work would usually indicate a logical development of style. So where do we find Rush with Counterparts? &quot;Animate&quot; features some mighty, thick sounding bass and edgy guitar lines while &quot;Stick It Out&quot; has some of the band's most menacing riffs, which is surprising after the groovy licks on Presto and Roll the Bones. One will correctly observe that the band is returning to a harder rocking sound. This was released in 1993, a time when alternative rock was consuming the radio, and you can hear the band accommodate a bit of that sensibility. They are wise, however, not to renounce melody for the sake of heavier songs. One of my favorites is &quot;Cold Fire,&quot; with a gripping refrain and a chorus that showcases the band's killer chops and Peart's frenetic drums. &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; is a smoky, compelling instrumental with engaging melodies, and at times it sounds like an instrumental version of &quot;Red Sector A&quot; (and that's good!). The heavily acoustic &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; lacks a bit of subtlety on the lyrical front, but the raw emotional power of the chorus, supplemented by Michael Kamen's weeping orchestrations, makes it a wonderful track. (Kamen...he's done everything!) Peart's lyrics astound as always, with the best to be found in the inspiriting finale &quot;Everyday Glory.&quot; In the final verse, he writes: &quot;Though we live in trying times we're the ones who have to try | Though we know that time has wings we're the ones who have to fly.&quot; Though not perfect, Counterparts shows how Rush continues to be one of music's mosy resourceful rock bands."

2084902,6300181286,"AFI top 100 film, Universal's Frankenstein is#1, now on DVD!","Universal Studios made its indelible mark in Hollywood due to its famous mastering of the Horror movie.  In 1931 Universals &quot;Frankenstein&quot; changed the film world forever.  Even today it remains a very basic classic horror movie.  The American Film Institute (AFI) voted it into the top 100 films in the first 100 years of film (1998).Universal gathered the movie genius' and embarked on adapting Mary Shelly's novel to the screen.  James Whale was chosen as the director and the make-up master Jack Pierce to create the giant Frankenstein Monster (played by Boris Karloff).NOTE: The movie actually had a opening caution film introduction because of its 1931 unspeakable subject matter.  People were genuinely scared, horrified but curious to see this film.Summary: The mad Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) &amp; his hunchback Assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) are robbing graves for bodys to construct a man to bring back to life.  The Dr. still needs a brain to fullfill his inventory.  Fritz steals a brain from the local medical school.  Unfortunately the only one available is an abnormal one.  The Dr. creates his monster being with the abnormal brain unknowingly.  Through lightning storms, electrical shocks and unbelievable special effects brings the Monster to life!  Now the horror is unleashed.This is the first in Universal Studio's &quot;Classic Monster Collection&quot; DVD Series.  This collection is the very best of their horror movies completely digitally remastered and uncensored.  With lots of special features, photos and narratives.  A must have DVD collection of classic Hollywood horror films."

289154,B0010XPE5C,Absorption and Allergy Issues,"I have used this product off and on for at least 7 years.  When I ordered it the last time, I didn't realize that ""flavoring"" and other questionable items had been added.  This made a bad problem become an unacceptable one.Let me first say, that I often noticed stomachaches after ingestion particularly if other food wasn't consumed (I always added it to my smoothie) but I'm talking something more solid in addition to that.  So, I started using only 1/2 the small scoop.  Second, I noticed most of it left via my urine within an hour.  So, I knew I was having absorption problems from the product when the distress decreased.Now, with the addition of ""Natural Orange-Pineapple Flavor"", which means it could be lab created chemicals, I experienced worse stomach distress, within 3 minutes, which included  burping ""orange"".  Most people buy these products because they want to improve their health, yet, many ""health"" oriented companies are more interested in increasing sales=increased profits.  Thus, they ""pretty"" up their product at the detriment to their customers!  Missing natural vitamins is a result of the processing of food and the whole genetic engineering of crops and destructive pesticides.  So now, we are paying good money to rebuild our health by adding what has been diminished; Vibrant Health offers a solution but then it creates more problems by adding chemicals to improve taste.I buy other Vibrant Health products and now I am leery of those as well, particularly from Amazon where the picture is small and I can't read ingredients.  Furthermore, they added Citric Acid (another lab chemical, as a preservative), Sunflower lecithin powder (preservative) and Stevia.  I won't buy this again!Thanks for nothing Vibrant Health!"

1551549,B000F3V880,This is No Raspberry Chipotle Sauce,"I gave this stuff a try after I fell in love with the Fischer & Wieser Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, which I mixed with olive oil to make into salad dressing.  This Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is nothing special in my book, for several reasons.  First, it is much TOO SPICY for my wimpy taste buds.  The Raspberry Chipotle had some bite, but I could handle it.  Not this stuff.  Second, the flavor combination here doesn't knock me off my feet, like the Raspberry Chipotle variety.  The mango and ginger flavors are quite strong, and not complementary, in my opinion.  Third, this sauce is not as versatile as the Raspberry Chipotle Sauce.  I expected that I would be able to make it into salad dressing, but the bottle had no such suggestions, as with the Raspberry Chipotle.  It seems to be good for fewer types of uses.  Anyway, it was worth a try, and it was not horrible.  My expectations were just too high after trying their Raspberry Chipotle Sauce."

3699332,B0047XTV3I,Great tank!,"I purchased this 7.9 Fluval Shrimp Habitat for a gift for my daughter and she keeps her red crayfish in it.  It is a really nice little tank, better than the usual with its nice background at the back of the tank (which the crayfish likes to climb) and a nice flourescent light on top so it is a more attractive & practical tank than the others my daughter owns.  It comes with some nice extras such as the shrimp care guide, some substrate (my daughter didn't use this though as she preferred some small black aquarium gravel), conditioner, filters, shrimp granules, net, etc.  It is a nice little habitat for crayfish, as we are currently using it for.  This is actually the second tank we ordered for this review as the first one arrived smashed.  I immediately received a refund on my credit card without any hassle (thank you!) and the second tank arrived in perfect condition.  Someone thought to package the second shipped tank with lots of packing material inside the shipped tank and it arrived in better condition than the first tank.  I would recommend this tank.  One word of caution though, my husband accidentally cracked my daughter's original Fluval Tank (the one I am rating is our third tank we have owned over the last few years) because he tipped the tank over too hard to drain it into the sink when cleaning it, so it is a great tank but take care cleaning it so that it may provide many years of service."
1296805,B0002II6V0,"Does Not Work as a Mute - if you need a practice mute, buy something else","I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together. I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. The mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works VERY well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. Also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), I suggest you buy something else. This item does not work and is a total waste of money. I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon (FYI, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! *Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley& aGlaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Mediumwith it!).I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way."

3722327,B0072O17M2,"Easy remedy for a serious problem, highly recommended","We adopted a cat from our local vet, and were told the cat was healthy. So when the cat kept throwing up his food, we thought the problem was the food (Iams kitten). Switching food didn't help, but the lady at the pet store said the cat could have worms. Sure enough, a look at some fresh cat barf revealed at least one worm, about 2-3 inches long. We think it could have been roundworms, but weren't sure; because this product targeted several different types of worms, exact identification wasn't crucial.This product was easy to administer. All we had to do was weigh our 2 cats, then measure out the correct dosage in the included syringe. One cat ate the vanilla flavored-scented liquid easily, while the other tolerated it and licked it off his mouth. After the first dose, the infected cat pooped out a lot of obviously dead worms.We followed up with two repeat doses 2 weeks apart (one more than required by the directions), and to date have had no more worm problems. This product was inexpensive, very effective, and a good value for the price. We have plenty of additional medication left over, should the problem reoccur. We'll look for more products from this company in the future if our cats need medication."

If you read the directions, it tells you to charge the battery for 12 hours before using it, and then drag it down low for a few cycles. They say it helps the battery. I did this, and it seems to work. I didn't use the new case back, I followed the advise of another poster, and used just the protective cover that came w/the Seidio BD2-HR5SSGS3-BK Extended Case & Holster Combo for the S3 (Fits Innocell 3500mAhBatteries). By doing this w/the 4200mAh Extended Battery, and a used foam ear plug between the battery and the protective cover this keeps everything nice and tight. It makes it so that you can use the protective cover, & the holster, but not the case back. However, if you use the Innocell 3500mAh Extended Life Battery, you can use both their new case back & the protective cover and they will both fit into the holster. I recommend this 4200mAh battery though, and our method of assembly."

178342,B00F7CQHC6,Five Stars,Good case. Buy it
1759552,B001G6VPJM,Awesome tool if you need tiny torx bits!,"Not a whole lot to say about this product, it is exactly what it is meant to be. The aluminum shaft of the pen has plenty of groves to keep a good grip, it feels secure enough, the bits stay in pretty well, and fit inside with room to spare. Glad I got this~ should make working on cell phones, computers, and other such electronics a lot easier! I'm probably going to end up purchasing several more of these for friends, family, and replacements if needed."
1707738,B0001IW50Y,Too simple to bend or damage,"I buy everything I review. To receive FIVE stars, a product must meet >90% of the manufacturer's claims. I don't subtract because I don' t like the color or appearance (too subjective and personal). I review form, function, ease of use, and construction quality. Please forgive typos: I'm an evidence-based scientist, NOT a typist. If you find my review helpful, please click ""YES"". This helps me improve future evaluations (which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions).Their Claim:  Used to work on small products around the houseMy Verdict (details below):  True, to a pointWe all know how needle nose pliers work. So let's skip that.These Stanley (who usually make excellent tools) pliers are made of sub-standard metal. So much so that with anything other than small jewelry (for instance, electrical wires or metal toys) the metal indents or bends. Further, the spring does not always return it to the open position. i returned the first and the same thing happened with the second. Pretty soon, the ends become misaligned as well. If you're a craftsperson, these may be ideal. If you're going to use this to bend 12 gauge metal wires (commonly used in all household wiring and NOT very thick), you'll soon have useless pliers.My advice: Avoid these and buy heavy duty needle nose pliers for a couple bucks more. You won't be sorry."
395746,B003IW7APA,Can't tolerate it - So not benenfit for me.,"I know these are some of the best things to take for folks in the 2ndhalf of life.  But both hubby and I developed very upset stomachs each day right after taking them.  We stopped - and the problem stopped.  Started up again - problems came right back.  It says on the label it may cause upset stomach - and for us, it sure does!!!I wish it came in a smaller capsule because then we could take a smaller dose."
532873,B00HK61L3C,So far...so amazing!,"I'm 24 years of age, I weighed 196 and now I'm at 190. I started P90X3, waking up every morning and starting on my workout, followed by a supplement shake I take from Shakeology. Right before, I take my shake, I take one pill of this, and some raspberry ketones from Nature Wise, along with the CLA 1250 Supplement. Every 2-3 hours, I'll have a snack, like a fiber bar, than for lunch, I'll have chicken and veggies, followed by another snack, and finally more chicken and veggies or maybe oatmeal. Now you may think 6 pounds isn't much, but this is literally, within a few days! I had ordered these pills, and was kind of procrastinating before I started, but just recently, this past Monday, I started my workout.Yes my workout is only 30 minutes from P90X3, but it's better than nothing, and it gets me started with a good sweat and good way to jump-start my metabolism. Yes I minimized what I eat, with a strict diet, tough, but I'm going for it. I'm trying to reach my ideal weight of 160, I had made it to 170 at one point, than slacked off and have gotten lazy. I feel these pills with what I eat, really boost the rate in which I burn food, it also helps me burn more, allowing for more pounds to be lost! Normally, with diet & exercise, just your average, you're looking at maybe 1-3 pounds lost a week,  but every body is different, so just give this product a try!"
3211257,B0034G4P80,THOR REVIEW,I did not see this movie when it was in the Theatre so I purchased the Blu-ray. This a great movie with a good plot and a lot of action. I would recommend this to anyone that likes action movies.
38849,B004MU1U2G,Good idea but...,"Good idea, but sloppy execution. If the buttons worked properly and had been made out of a higher quality tpu it would have worked tremendously. The card holder area it's self is also made of cheap materials and only allows for one card. This company needs to invest more into quality materials and better designs that are more functional. I would have returned it, but after two weeks, I just threw it away. Spigen make superior cases, buy from them or get an Otterbox."
1894267,0767805712,Better than the Matrix,"Gattaca takes a cliched sci-fi theme, genetics engineering gone wrong, and makes of it an intelligent, haunting fable about society stifling individuals, and of over coming obstacles to follow the true desires of one's heart.The screen writing is achingly beautiful. It speaks of many things; the rivalry that exists between brothers, a society that will judge a human being not by who he is but by his genes, and of a normal person who will break through all the walls such a society sets in front of him to fulfill the longing of his heart, the space.I felt like crying after watching the movie, there were so many emotions stirred up inside me. It shook me to my very core. The only time I felt that way after watching a movie was when I watched Shawshank Redemption. I felt so angry for Vincent and the way the world is in Gattaca. I felt so much sorrow for Jude Law. When the movie finally ended, I felt a shock of hope, the kind of hope you get when you see how life can work out despite all the odds. It's a movie that will definitely make you think and feel.Ethan Hawke's acting is, as usual, subtle and believable. It's said that making the protagonist narrate a story isn't a good idea, but Ethan Hawke somehow makes it work. (Think 'Great Expectations.') He doesn't over-act to make you see his point; he doesn't shout, he doesn't sob, he doesn't whisper. He just becomes Vincent the in-Valid. There's no Ethan Hawke to be seen, only a very human, very determined man who will go to space no matter what.Jude Law does a great job as supporting actor. Arrogant, short-tempered and yet with a warm heart, his character comes to life quite well. As an invalid Valid, if you'll pardon the pun, he represents all the irony this futuristic caste system brought. Sitting around in the basement drinking beer, he casts a new light onto the story and onto Vincent's plight. (Did anyone else like the line 'I'm bored, I'm BORED talking to you!' as much as I did? ^-^)Uma Thurman was okay. There's nothing noticeable about her acting, but I guess that was the whole point. The spotlight falls on Vincent as it should.One of the most brilliant science-fiction movies of the decade, it's a joy to watch and a pleasure to remember. Worth your money."
1475985,B004HCYVNO,Fun Game,This game is a lot of fun and many generations of people love this game.  It would make a great addition to any group event or family fun night.
1810922,B009G48A8A,Fantastic,"This works great.  It is much brighter than the incandescent light, also less bulky.  If onlythe beam was focus-able I'd abandon my mag-light too!"
1074617,B00BL0I7WG,Very Easy,This program is very very easy and not very scary.  The items you are looking for actually stand out a bit making them even easier to find.  Not what I was looking for.
1030076,B00ANW33CM,challenging,"I'm not the best at hand to eye coordination, so making the cubes spin to find the matches is a tad challenging."
2715149,B00029RT9E,How much money was wasted making this?,"This movie is terrible, all the more given the talent involved. Andy Garcia, Samuel L. Jackson and Ashley Judd all give awful performances which can't really be helped given the horrible dialog they are given to say and the stupid things they are given to do. The plot is Ashley Judd plays an alcoholic cop who sleeps with men she picks up at the local bars. The men she's been with start turning up dead and she is logically the main suspect. In the end it doesn't matter what the movie is about because it's all done so badly."
3755819,B0030PWDQG,Horrible Wax - Stay Away unless you have a Buffer,This stuff dries way too fast...stay away unless you have a Buffer Machine - Unimpressed!  Get McGuiars its soo much better.
819729,B007Z4AKQI,too Complicated for me,It's not much fun. It's too difficult to maneuver so I just deleted it. My grandchildren won't even play it. After about 5 minutes they are through with the game and want something else loaded.
418921,B004CD8B2A,excellent--and for more than one reason !!!,"These are excellent soft bristle toothbrushes that let me brush my teeth while not making any inflamed gums bleed while I brush--and that's great! Each toothbrush lasts about as long as the other brands do; yet this brand is definitely superior because my gums simply never bleed even when they are inflamed--but my teeth are very nicely cleaned!There is another reason why I buy these toothbrushes. Believe it or not, they are great--for cleaning the record albums I collect! Just use some water mixed with a bit of liquid dishwashing soap and dunk one of these into the slightly soapy water--the soft bristles with some soapy water on them get into the groves on each record album without harming it--the brush removes dirt, dust and grime if the record comes from a garage sale and it hasn't seen the light of day for ages. These are even great for cleaning those old 78rpm records in my collection.In short, for both reasons above, I have never been anything less than 100% satisfied with these toothbrushes. I highly recommend them."

80452,B007FXMOV8,Great Product,"The New Trent stylus is much better quality stylus than many out there.Outside: The metal is solid and feels like you're actually holding something. It's well-constructed, no gaps in the metal, the paint doesn't wear off in a day, and shape is stylish and attractive.Inside: The retracting spring works smoothly with no failure.Nib: The nib is softer than it looks in the pictures. I was a bit worried when I purchased it that it would actually scratch the surface because of the metallic look. But no fear! It's a soft microfiber that glides safely and gently across the surface.I previously purchased a stylus through The Friendly Swede and it was totally junky looking and feeling. The end was rubber and wide. It looked cheap and felt even worse. I'm really glad I made this purchase."
1106399,B00CDW2B5K,love it!,I love the app. I've been playing for hours. The graphics are great but the characters/animals are cheesy and I wish you could play with no avatars I think it would look much classier. The ads are annoying but hey it's free. I will checking out more card apps from them!
1148767,B00DH1G7DS,Cute but slow,"I played this game on my Kindle Fire HD.. The graphics are cute ... especially when the number disappears when the ninth one is placed. However, I play electronic sudoku for speed and the &quot;cute&quot; animation makes for a very slow response time ... I'm touching the next square I want to fill and the game is still fiddling with the last square. If you don't care about timing, then the game is great but I'm uninstalling."

1780134,B003DZ02MA,Saved my hands on a number of occasions,"For knife sharpening, slicing, or other activities that involve sharp objects moving around, these are great to have.  I used them while slicing vegetables with a super sharp mandoline and while I definitely hit the blade several times, I wound up without a scratch.  Wearing the gloves helped me to work more quickly and confidently, and without them, I would likely have been making a trip to the hospital."

Sure once in a while, some poop or pee gets stuck to the rake, it does have a bit of a noise to it when its scooping, BUT, I never have to scoop the litter box! and it no longer stinks in my house like litter box!!! AMAZING!!!! I was content with &#34;the old way&#34; until I got my siamese cat who doesn't believe in cover her poop, and so it was SUPER STINKY! Not anymore! My particular one came broken but amazon did issue my a credit because of it."
129082,B009P5XSAU,Put this one on your short list,"This phone has to be one of the top 5 Android phones available right now.  One thing that made this phone stand out from the competition is the build quality.  It feels rock solid with its KEVLAR backing, Gorilla Glass, and a water-repellent nanocoating for added assurance.I've owned this phone for about 6 weeks now and the performance is 2nd to none.  Call quality is great even on the speaker phone; and the battery life is above average for a smartphone with this size of display and performance specs.  Motorola has done a very good job of minimizing their presence within the Android OS, while still providing some very useful custom apps, such as SMARTACTIONS, Circles and the Quick Settings menu.  SMARTACTIONS allows you to automate tasks based on conditions; for example if your battery power drops below 25%, it will automatically adjust the display brightness, and turn off the WiFi or any other feature you elect to change.  The conditions are not limited to battery power; it can be based on your GPS location, like silencing your ringer while at work, or based on time of day, etc...  ""Circles"" is a nice widget that displays information of your choosing such as time, weather, battery level etc...  With ""Quick Settings"" you simply swipe to the left from the home screen to access frequently used settings.As many other reviewers have stated, the one area this phone falls short is the camera.  Despite its 8.0MP rating, it does not perform very well in most environments.  My experience has been that pictures are grainy and colors are not true.  I was aware of the poor camera reviews before I purchased the phone, so I had an idea of what I was getting.  Although a better camera would be really nice; I have a DSLR that I use at events where I desire high quality photos so it wasn't a deal breaker for me, but for others it might be; especially because some of the competitors have really outstanding cameras."

Next time, I will get the ones with tabs, as I did not realise these are pullups but they have the same diaper  with the tabs too. You have to carefully read the description so that you are really buying the ones that hold 28 to 32 oz as they have similar packages that do not hold as much liquid. Mom stays dry all night in these. Also, they are easy to remove if you tear the sides first."
1737154,B000NIKA4U,"Fast, Professional, Built to Last and at a Good Price","My first impression was the case.  It is a hard yellow case that neatly organizes the sockets.  It has a screw to lock it in case the fastener breaks.  When you open the case and pick up the socket, you can tell it is tough and sturdy.  It is the hardened black steel professional shops use, I am not sure if it is tungsten but it can handle a lot of foot pounds.  I used it for my car but can imagine how useful it is for construction and big anchor bolts.  It was on sale and it got here in only a day so there is nothing to complain about."

457984,B006D0PTPM,"Not my favorite, but not bad at all","So far my favorite 'clinical' deodorant/anti-perspirant is unscented, but this version's scent is very mild.  It works well, although like many others, I usually put on my deodorant before I get dressed, so it could very well work even better if you follow the directions and apply it at night before you go to bed.  By doing so, it is absorbed into the skin and forms a better layer of protection which is supposed to also affect any possible skin discoloration.  I didn't expect to see a change after only using it a month, and I wasn't surprised.  I suspect that happens after more long-term use.So if you want to try something new, and have sensitive skin, I'd recommend this.  But if you tend toward reactions from soap/fabric softener products, I recommend trying it on a small area of skin before you apply it for daily use, just to be safe."
1792123,B004TGO6RY,The best movable AC timer I've found,"If you can imagine everything you would want in an appliance timer, this has it. I use them to ensure that space heaters turn off when not needed, and to turn on ozone generators overnight.  The orientation of the outlet allowed me to plug the ozone generator directly into the timer and into the wall without any wiring, which was a welcome added benefit.  Yes, it is comparatively expensive, but what price perfection?"

They seemed bright enough but with a lot of these LED bulbs the light is not 360 degrees so it gave me a darker ceiling. So I put two incandescent ones back in two of the end fixtures and that seemed to even out the light distribution. But this problem seems to be consistent across the selection of bulbs in this class. The bulb itself gives a nice color and the output is great.Update, The first bulb quit working after about 3 hours of use. I put it in a protected porch light. I would not recommend these bulbs!"

You can get one blade, but not two that are needed.  Vine should consider this before offering items like this.To purchase a second AutoTex wiper blade via Amazon would cost 3 times as much as I spend on wiper blades, and I truly don't believe the AutoTex blades can wipe rain off my windshields three times faster.Not a good offer for Amazon Vine"
1858550,B00005R09Z,What's the point???,"The Cure have already put out one of the most celebrated best-of's of the rock era, ""Staring At The Sea"", covering all the singles from their 1979-1985 period (definitely the fans' favorite era). They followed it up a few years back with an admirable companion, ""Galore"", which picked up where the previous volume left off. Those two CD's give you every single the Cure released up through 1997. I would suggest picking those two up and leaving this one (which only scrapes together a few choice selections from those albums and throws in two new songs) in the dust. If ""Greatest Hits"" at least contained two of their biggest breakthrough hits from ""Disintegration"" (""Fascination Street"" and ""Pictures of You""), I could recommend it for an ultra-casual fan, but without those two songs it barely merits mention. It doesn't even contain anything from ""Bloodflowers"", their last stuido album, the only one not covered on ""Staring At The Sea"" or ""Galore"". The completist will want it for the two new songs (what a [bad move] move by the band and the record company), but for the casual fan, get the previous two compilations and enjoy!"

""Baby Step Back"" and ""Ghosts Of Cape Horn"" are original versions, but little else is.  It doesn't make any sense to take an artist's best loved songs, re-record them, then think they are better than the original versions.  Sadly, they are not, and that is what prompts me to issue a 2-star rating for this album."

3197222,B002ZG997C,"Weak, Very Weak","*** This review may contain spoilers ***On the whole, I have not been impressed with Denzel's body of work since he won his second Oscar forTraining Day (Snap Case), and this film does nothing to reverse that trend.In this, he plays a lone warrior wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but unlike most other protagonists in films like this, he actually has a place to go and something to do. I won't say where he's going or why, but he's been doing it for over 30 years, which quite possibly makes him the hero with the worst sense of direction ever (has he ever heard of a map and compass?). But I digress.It starts interestingly enough, establishing his character in some ways you don't usually see. Of course he is a good fighter, as you have to be in a world like this, but then he unheroically leaves a couple of fellow wanderers to the untender mercies of some roaming bikers after dealing with a larger group of bandits. What, now he's afraid to fight? I suppose that, given his purpose, that can be excused, but that's still a bit hard to swallow.Anyway, he comes across a small town ruled by the iron fist of Gary Oldman, whose great power is that he can...read. That's not a typo, he can read, and that is apparently all the power he needs. We never once see him do anything that shows his evil nature, unless you count him raising his voice against a couple of women and pulling on the hair of a blind Jennifer Beals. Come on, this is Gary Oldman, the King of Psychotic Villains, and this is the best you can do with him?I could go on with other problems, such as there being no final showdown in the third act or Denzel's ability to survive a gut shot long after he should have been dead, but frankly I can't go any further. The more I type, the more I realize exactly how much this movie sucked and the less chance I have of forgetting that I saw it. About the only good thing about this movie the ""sacred"" item he had and a few neat twists at the end, but definitely not worth the price of admission."

1860688,B00006BXJY,One of the most overrated CDs of the year.,"Don't get me wrong.  I do enjoy this CD, to a certain degree though.  It isn't a surprise at how highly overrated this EP is...first off, you have Mike Patton (most overrated musician in the last 15 years) teaming up with an amazing band in The Dillinger Escape Plan.  The EP isn't bad, 'Rock Paper Scissor' being my personal favorite, it's just not AMAZING.  Really listen to it, it sounds like DEP is rehashing some material from Calculating Infinity.  And as for Patton, it sounds like his vocals are a mixture of Fantomas and Tomahawk.  He is busy buzzing and chirping over the music 98% of the time, so you can't digest the great music that DEP bring to the table.  Simply put, he can be downright annoying.  It sounds exactly like, if DEP and Patton were to collaborate.  Trust me, it's nothing to woo over like a mindless maniac.  I like it, it's just not great.  Bring on the new DEP full-length.  And I think Patton should go back to whatever band he's messing with now."
1843805,B0000039QA,"Nice Try, Puffy....","Truth be known. BIG was NOT the king of Eastcoast hip-hop as much as he was credited for(or at least never on Puffy's label). The entire label is based on using premade samples from oldschool artists', that's not being original. Not only that, but lyrics lack substance horribly and serve for very little meaning. You can't consider yourself a king of hip-hop if all you're doing is biting off other artists' beats. Perhaps if BIG was under another label with better guidance, be could have easily been a much better artist, perhaps even be alive today."
1583467,B001E5E12S,Huge Messy Glob delivered to door - Twice!,"I've ordered honey from Amazon previously and thought I'd try this even though it is slightly more expensive. As a person who enjoys tasting different varieties of honey but primarily likes a little in my tea, I was looking forward to testing it.Instead, the first order was returned back to Amazon due to damages. I had to call Amazon since there wasn't a replacement or refund. A second order was sent via overnight delivery only to have a box seeping with honey set in front of my door by the delivery man. When I refused to sign for it in that condition you can imagine how unhappy they were...he said it had already seeped all over the conveyor belt, his truck, other packages etc...Big ughly mess. I've gone back to ordering the other brand of honey. It's less expensive, tasty and arrives in good order."
1586028,B001EO5ROA,"Really bitter, though very orange-y","I bought this to flavor Greek yogurt, for which I need something that is both orange and sweet.  It was awful - more Valencia (ie, bitter) than orange, and not sweet at all.  I'm saving it to add bitterness to regular orange juice when a recipe calls for Valencia orange but can't imagine using it for any other purpose.  I figured if I wanted orange yogurt, I'd just have to pay the price and buy Chobani's ""blood orange"" (a great flavor - but really, $1.25 for a cup of yogurt??).Then I tried NuStevia's orange flavored stevia.  That one is both orange and sweet - perfect for my purposes.  If you're looking for a SWEET orange flavoring, skip this one and buy NuStevia.  Great stuff."
1665952,B0083QHK8S,Very disappointed in Amazon,"I ordered two of these thinking it was a 26 oz glass jar. It is not. It is a plastic jar. What I get at the store is in a glass jar. The package had been squeezed and the plastic jar has oil leaking from it. I am reconsidering my grocery orders with Amazon because there is no way to tell Amazon that I don't think I should pay for this. One of the available actions for the product says, ""Return or replace items."" When I click that the message says, ""This item is not eligible for return. Please see our Returns Policy for more information. If you require further assistance, please use the Contact Us button on the Help pages."" When I go to the help page and click the Contact Us button, find the order in the ""Which order are you contacting us about?"" dialog box, click done, I get three options: Track my package, Return or Replace Items, Leave Package/Delivery Feedback. When I click Return or Replace, I get the message """"This item is not eligible for return. Please see our Returns Policy for more information.

1748888,B001007O6M,"poor finish with scratches, dings and dents out of a sealed new boxes","At the stores I noticed lots of scratches and dings on the finishes and selected 3 that I thought did not have scratches.  After removing the 3 that I purchased from the box, they all had scratches too.  I called Kwikset and they said they should not be scratched and to return them to the store.  I asked them to look into their manufacturing quality, but the customer service person did not seem interested and told me the store should investigate.I have looked at 50 boxes of new kwikset and all are of poor quality finish.It is really too bad their quality is so poor, I like the rekey idea and really want to own these locks.Kwikset needs much better quality control and should not ship defective products!Also,  with an allen wrench, from the outside you can remove the keyed knob and then a remove a small piece of metal to remove the cylinder.This is not secure!"
1299953,B0018SJLFS,Very Unhappy with the performance and quality,"I had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so I experimented and replaced all the tubes.  Issues not only continued but worsened.  Hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes.  I eventually put back the original El84s and that didn't help.  Once I removed the Tung-Sol 12AX7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par.  My experience with the Tung-Sol tubes was very, very negative.  They caused me to go out and buy another amp.  I had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast.  I'll never buy this brand again."

I know a lot of girls out there are longing for some piece some kind of strand, or a glimspe on the screen of empowered women/girls that they can identify with. But don't fool yourself! This movie is truely awful, and even at times explotational towards the women it has the reputation to empower. Self respecting women/girls, don't doubt that pang of annoyance and don't settle for low rate tripe like this.  Read that book, it is a masterpiece! This movie is an abomniation to the book, and an abomination to the messages and spirit as well! So come on! Resist the tempation to cling to thoes flashes of inspiration that quickly fall through the cracks in this film, and dare to think. There are other great films out there, and if the storyline interests you, the book is far superior."

1883268,B0074EIQQU,I'm Sill Waiting at the Drive-In,"The Mars Volta serve as a warning as to just what can happen when a band are awarded artistic carte blanche thanks to the unreserved fawning of their fan base - they've become a mewling, bloated, ungainly beast, a non stop horror show made up of every prog no-no you could imagine. I mean let's just focus on 'Whip Hand', the opener to 'Noctourniquet' - the song begins with thirty seconds of ugly spasmodic guitar noise, this is followed by a plodding verse of strained screechy vocals, all leading up to...a flatulence solo. There is no other way I can describe it, it sounds like someone blowing a raspberry while all the time those unrelenting wailing vocals continue, awkwardly attempting to stamp a reluctant melody line over the top. The song communicates nothing and sounds unintentionally comedic at best, not unlike a 'Flight of the Conchords' prog rock pastiche - and believe it or not this comedy value actually renders this moment as a high spot of sorts as elsewhere the results are just tedious and largely deathly slow paced. In terms of respite 'The Malkin Jewel' at least sounds different, sticks to a more standard rock format and allows Bixler to apply some intensity to his voice.This is all coming from a fan of At the Drive-In's 'Relationship of Command', an album that displays force, focus and restraint - elements painfully lacking here. Cedric's vocals suit a more punk, tight and aggressive style of delivery rather than the free form warbling he has adopted for The Mars Volta. I'm happy admitting that 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' had some charm and a few great riffs (final track 'Cerpin Taxt' immediately springs to mind) but this experiment has now grossly outstayed its welcome and I can only register my approval that At the Drive-In are reforming."
3150693,B002DYKPF6,The X-Men Continue to Steamroll Through Television,"Disney has done the surprising and has apparently committed to releasing an entire series worth of one of its cartoons.  Of course, this comes with a price.  Disney, caring only for its profit line, has chosen to give us the X-Men series but without any bells and whistles.  These are the episodes as they appeared on television in the 1990's.  There no visual or audio enhancements, no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, no interviews with the cast, crew, or creators.  The only noteworthy addition would be the original, and attractive, cover art for each volume.  Of course, if you have purchased Volumes 1 and 2 then you are already aware of this.  Truth be told, I enjoy the extra ""fluff"" thrown into most releases but what truly matters to me is having the episodes themselves on DVD, so in that regard, I am satisfied.  The price is reasonable as well, I've had no trouble finding these releases for well under 20 dollars, though their list price is much higher.At any rate, I could rattle on and on about the sub-par presentation as other classic series are sold at the same price and look much better (Ghostbusters is the first that comes to mind) but it is what it is.  The episodes are what matter most and here Volume 3 does not disappoint.  There are quite a number of fan favorites and personal favorites on these discs.  Most likely will be excited to have The Dark Phoenix Saga to pair with Volume 2's Phoenix Saga.  I personally enjoy Iceman's lone episode, ""Cold Comfort,"" and made-for-TV character Morph's reintroduction on the episode ""Courage.""  The two-part ""One Man's Worth"" is the series first take on The Age of Apocalypse, a popular arc in the comic books during the series run.  The not included on this set four part ""Beyond Good and Evil"" is a sort of spiritual Age of Apocalypse in which Apocalypse manipulates time in an effort to destroy the universe, and so on.  It really only relates to the Age of Apocalypse in that Apocalypse is at the wheel.  ""One Man's Worth"" takes the foundation of AoA, a time traveler kills Xavier before he forms the X-Men, and the resulting impact on the world.  Only in this case, Apocalypse has nothing to do with it and the result is a war between mankind and mutant-kind.  We get a look at the resulting world and a lot of the character designs are lifted from AoA and it turns into a pretty engaging story.  I would have liked to see this two-parter expanded into another four part series but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.Some other highlights include the introduction of Nightcrawler who gets his own self-titled episode, Archangel's return in ""Obsession,"" and some more backstory involving Wolverine in ""Weapon X: Lies and Videotapes.""  The episodes are well done though the same issues still persist in regards to consistency (some characters will be colored wrong or minor continuity errors arise).  These errors are superficial and serve only as distractions and are commonplace in pretty much every cartoon series.  The series did pretty much completely drop its serial-styled run in that all episodes are mostly self-contained.  This is the style the show would adopt for the remainder of its run: multi-part arcs with standalone episodes mixed in.  A few episodes do reference prior ones, such as ""Obsession"" and ""Courage,"" but it would be fairly easy for someone to jump right in if they so desired.Sadly, this Volume in some ways represents the last of the great episodes spawned by this series.  That is not to say that what follows is garbage by any means, but the show will soon start to suffer creatively as it tries to sustain itself beyond its expectations.  If you own the first two volumes this should already be in your collection.  If you're on the fence I give you full permission to purchase this as well.  If you've never experienced the show then start with Volume 1 as it serves as the introduction to the series and is still the best collection of episodes.  If you don't care about cartoons or the X-Men, then why did you read this far?"

If you remember Peter Potamus and Touche' Turtle and others from the 60's you will enjoy this set.
265762,B000NILWRE,Good Proprietary  Blend...Trusted Brand,"I've been taking a resveratrol supplement in some for now for over a year.  At first I took just straight resveratrol in a number of different strengths.  But after a few months I decided that I was taking too much of it and possibly wasting money after doing some research online for dosages.  Especially since it's not the only antioxidant I take.  I not only feel I have I found a great proprietary blend in this formula, but I have also have come to very much like Jarrow products as well over the last year.  I was already take their lycopene and fish oil complex among others when this came along.  This formula gives you what I consider a healthy dose of resveratrol, plus green tea, and both grape seed and grape skin extracts.  All of these ingredients are well known for their health benefits, as well as antioxidant qualities.  This Jarrow's formula is very reasonably priced here on Amazon, and a very trusted and well proven brand to me.  I highly recommend it.. : )"
1884183,B008RYN44U,Sold Doubt!,"So many reasons why this album isnt working for me. I shouldn't have to train myself to like an album. The album isn't awful but it definitely not worth the wait at all. This isn't even Rock or even Pop/Rock- Its closer to Trance music, The sound that I thought Gwen would have as a solo artist. The name of this band should be 'Sold Doubt' because that's exactly what they've done. They 'fixed' themselves- they grew up anyway and had kids so they're minds are different anyway. They're business people- its not about how cool anyone can be or who can make a statement. Those days are gone- they have.mouths to feed, its a whole new ballgame hunny.For starters I'm a huge fan of retro, vintage, throwbacks etc however these songs are literally boring- I've been trying to get into this album and its just getting to be like sitying in history class on a block schedule. The only songs I find listenable are ""Heaven"" ""Gravity"" and ""Undercover"" everything else is bland. There's no personality or spunk anywhere on this album whatsoever. Where's the art? Where's the show? Where's the energy? Where's the entertainment? These songs can put anyone to sleep. Does it really take a band to do these songs? Gwen could've did this album under her own name. I'm shocked that this is all they came up with since 2007, this isn't good.What makes this album even less listenable is the mastering of the songs. The songs are mixed to high. Can anyone say LOUDNESS WAR?I'm disgusted."

The game play for the the trilogy is pretty much the same from before so there isn't any new button mashing you really have to learn.  At the end if you don't already have these games then this set is a must have but if you already have the previous PS2 version I'd advise trying a demo first just to see if you feel it's worth purchasing or not..."

1866862,B0001CNQP8,Voice and Piano Perfect....Background Sound Not So Perfect,"Keri Noble I just came across online by accident. I'm a major Vanessa Carlton fan and under her name of similar artists there was Keri's name and I never heard of her before so I decided to check her out. She kind of sounded like Sarah McLachlan, but with her own sound definitely. I liked what I heard online so I decided to be impulsive and buy it! Well I actually do like this c.d. a lot. Yet not for the whole c.d. entirely but for the potential I hear in Keri. Her voice is so strong and clear, and her piano melodies are very nice and blend with her voice splendidly. Yet...why this c.d. is not five stars but four (3.5- 4 stars) is because of a few songs on here and the background sound. Some songs on here could have been much stronger if she would have cut out some of the sound because like on Let It Rain, in the chorus, it really weakened her voice. While on like If No One Will Listen, all there really was was her piano and just her, and that's what made that song so strong and beautiful. One thing I loved was how she explained all of her songs in the c.d. booklet and explained her isnpiration for them. Let me explain though all the songs from my point of view, pointing out the stronger ones over the weaker ones.1) Look At Me- Very strong song, one of the first few I got hooked on. One of her songs where you just really hear her piano and her. Beautiful and just pleasant to hear. (5/ 5)2) Talk To Me- Eh not one of the strongest on here, definitely pales in comparison to Look At Me. It has a catchy beat to it and I usually do not skip it but it is not the strongest on here. (3/ 5)3) Piece of My Heart- A lot better, much more catchier and the chorus is actually pretty good. It is a slower and more comforting song. (4/ 5)4) A Dream About You- Going even more slower and darker, and yet it is lovely and the piano and Keri can be heard clearly. I like this song. (4/ 5)5) About Me- This is one of the songs I have trouble with. I usually skip this song. It is hardly memorable. The beat is good but the rest of the song is nothing special. One of the weakest songs on here. (2/ 5)6) Let It Rain- Probably the song I don't like the most on here. I do not like the background sound at all on this song it does not match well with Keri to me and the song itself is nothing to remember. (1/ 5)7) Falling- Keri quickly saves herself though on this song. This song has to be one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. The piano I can finally hear again, and it is a lovely combination with Keri's voice. Slow and wonderful. (5/ 5)8) Love is All I Know- The background sound makes the song kind of weak, but overall it is not too bad. I love the lyrics and the chorus is nice- sounding. (4/ 5)9)Answered Prayer- Like Falling this song is quite stunning. Once more it is really only Keri and the piano together as one. (4/ 5)10) Bartender- I really think this song is cool. It's like Keri is sitting down with you and talking to you about a story. The background sound actually sounds good with Keri this time. (5/ 5)11) I Won't- Probably the best song on here besides Look At Me and Falling for it is one of the catchiest and the lyrics are awesome. 'I won't let you hurt me, I won't beg you to stay, I won't lay down and shut my mouth so you can brag the next day'. Awesome. (5/ 5)12) If No One Will Listen- Like Look At Me, this song is very soft, slow, and overall beautiful. Keri and the piano are one as is favored. (5/ 5)13) (Bonus track) Honest- This may take a few listens before you can get into it. At first I thought it sounded bad, but then after hearing it a few more times it really is not too bad, not the strongest on here, but actually lovely. (4/ 5)So mainly my grading rounds out to around 4 stars. Keri Noble has a strong voice and her piano skills are great, but on her next album I hope to hear better back ground sound, for there were songs on here that could have been solid 5 star songs if she didn't have some of that extra sound. I found myself loving the songs with her and just really the piano. Her voice and piano are perfect, but her background sound needs some good tweaking in some spots. That's all. I like the c.d. but I mainly listen to her ending songs more than her beginning songs, for her ending songs to me are the most powerful.She doesn't beat Vanessa Carlton but I can tell Keri Noble has just as much potential as Vanessa, and I hope her next c.d. proves this more."

3751502,B0015DQ81G,"Cumbersome, big and heavy...","I was hoping this tool to be good, but it has poor design. In my honest opinion, the tool is way too big/tall and heavy because 50% of the time I can't take a tread reading because the tool is too big to fit in between the tire and the upper wheel walls on most of the cars I work on. This thing weighs like 1/2 pound and that's just way too heavy for a tire tread gauge. It does feel rock solid sturdier though, but it too difficult to use because it's hard to quickly retract the measuring point in between taking readings."
1367310,B000BHQZAQ,Great graphics but several concerns!,"A game that started out great but quickly became disappointing...let me explain.The Pros:1.)Great graphics and good audio.2.)Easy to save/load with F5 and F9 respectively; but there is little reason to use these. [see Cons: 3.) below]3.)A few new weapons and a couple of new transport systems.The Cons:1.)Repetitious play. About half way through you've met all the various aliens that are going to try to obstruct your path.All levels involve killing all the aliens to open up a portal to the next level. This is basically the entire game.2.)There are a few levels involving some flying of a lightly armed shuttle-craft; however the encounters with the enemy aircraft usually occur in an area where there is not much space and the enemy is much faster and more maneuverable than you. You're better off to quickly land your craft at a docking pod and engage the enemy fighters from the ground.3.)BUT, the most annoying feature of actual game play is the fact that it doesn't matter if you live of die in a fight...Why? Well, let me elaborate a little; because you play a native Cherokee Indian you have connections to the spirit world. If you die you simply go to the spirit world, restock up on hit points and return to the game at the point where you died. There is no reason to fight for your life if you're taking a beating; just stand there, get killed, get automatically transported to the spririt world, reload on hit points and start again where you left off. Initially  this seemed like a great feature, but it quickly became obvious that all the fun and uncertainty of major battles disappeared because you now can win all battles by simply wearing down your opponent's hit points, as he/she cannot renew theirs, at crucial times, like you can.4.) The game is only available on the ""easy"" level until you beat it the first time; the problem being, I can't think of a single level I'd want to play again on any level. (easy or difficult)5.)Also, if you wanted to play the game again on the difficult level, you must go through the entire bar sequence at the beginning of the game and also watch a prolonged movie segment at the start of the first level in the alien ship; there is no way to skip these sections and they are tediously long.All in all a game that had great potential but instead was a disappointment in many ways; too easy and repetitious are just 2 of the a series of problems with this FPS.2 Stars"

Mesmerizing.My faves are: I Want You, I'm The One You Need, Commitment Of Love, It All Begins With You, Dance To The Music, Always And Forever and Until The Last Goodbye.  Each &  every song showcases her in different facets of her life.  To me, Affairs Of The Heart is one of her many personal albums.  If you like good dance music along with mature sounding soul, get it!"

1303450,B007T8CUNG,"True bypass, no effect!","It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp.

When received the package did not appear to be damaged, but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument."
1649067,B005BPVCVU,Disappointly bitter taste,"I was excited to try this product, as I usually have bars for breakfast, but it is getting harder to find ones that have good nutritional profiles in breakfast-appropriate (i.e., non-chocolate) flavors.  I love cranberry, so this bar seemed nearly perfect, especially given that I checked out the nutritional content prior to ordering.  At 4 grams, the amount of protein was a bit low for my liking, but the bar made up for this by being low in both sugar (12 grams) and saturated fat (1 gram) while being very high in fiber (7 grams).The texture of this bar is the first thing that struck me as a bit odd.  Although it is moist (i.e., as opposed to hard and crunchy), it is not chewy; in fact, it breaks apart easily and is a bit on the crumbly side.  (I suppose it is somewhat similar to a a CLIF brand bar.)  The taste, however, was quite disappointing:  rather than the tart taste of cranberry or the sweetness of orange, I detected only a bitter flavor.  It tasted almost as if the bar had been flavored with the bitter rind of the orange.  There did seem to be little fruit pieces in the bar that may have been cranberry, but unfortunately, the unpleasant bitterness overpowered everything else.I thought the first bar that I tried was just okay, but the second one seemed worse, and now I'm afraid I might have to toss the whole box (which I HATE to do--I hate being wasteful, so I might try dipping them in yogurt or something just to get through them).  Perhaps another flavor by this brand would be better, but unfortunately, I can't recommend these."

I am completely satisfied with its form and functionality. I love having 4 USB ports, and that it came with a cord and all adapters plus carrying pouch. Well worth the $41 I paid on Amazon."

3748170,B000EDUTWM,Double-sided tape won't last long,Purchased 3. Good idea and worked for about 2-3 weeks then I opened up my RV one day to find them on the ground. Double sided tape is a major flaw. I only had 2 DVD's in one and other 2 empty so should of held up. I did everything like clean the wall prior to installing but still can't expect a thin piece of tape to hold it for to long. Another thing is you can see the white foam tape on the sides after attaching which looks poor. I didn't give up though...I mounted them with small brass L brackets and screws now and no more issues.

3748148,B000EDST24,Good Idea---Bad Installation,"OK...this seems like a good idea; however, the instructions call for a 9/16 drill bit.  Good luck finding that.  I have several bit sets and none of them had this size.  Home Depot said the could 'special order' it!  Obviously it would have made much more sense to have an installation that used readily available tools. One could spend more on the installation material (aka unusual sized drill bit) than on the actual product."

I'd assume if you have small to medium size head you will be OK.Never had any problem w/ the 3M 1860 in the past 12+ years using N95 masks, for once I decided to change something that is not broken I created headaches for myself.Amazon should stop carrying this mask, nobody would wear a N95 mask for decorative purpose, one wears it out of necessity and this mask has proven to  be defective 2 times out of 3 when I needed it."

How cheesy and how annoying! Just ugh! PG-13ified ugh!For most of the film, I liked it. Norman Reedus, as always, is very reliable and creates a brooding, beleaguered and interesting character around which the story revolves. The scarecrow was very well done and genuinely creepy.  I was enjoying the ride until right after the 'reveal', in which he is handed the book of the black arts that explains everything and he knows what is coming next. The trailer also suggests the ending will go in a different direction than it actually goes. I don't want to spoil it so I will be vague. I literally moaned and rolled my eyes when the tractor scene began. I couldn't believe they were going there. What a waste!"

So I was excited to try this, but once I saw that it contains Yucca Schidigera Extract I won't be giving it to her. This Yucca Extract is also found in many higher-end cat and dog foods and it's used to keep the poo from smelling bad. There have been recent studies that Yucca can raise blood urea levels that can contribute to kidney disease, more likely to happen in cats than other species this is intended for. So I'm not taking any chances; if further studies come out that reverse these findings, I'll reconsider this supplement at that time.NOTE:  For those of you who purchase this to help with your dog's/cat's bad breath, please first schedule a vet visit to rule out other causes than ""just"" foul-smelling breath."

1807802,B008BXXOHE,4 stars until the pad tears......kinda short for taller people.,"Summary:  4 stars until the pad tears.  Having used their stick roller to do walls, this product has a similar issue - cleanup is a little bit of a pain.Prior to this I used a Wagner airless sprayer to apply stain - I'd then go over it with a 4"" brush to even it out and get it to the sides of the boards.  This has a side pad which does that for you. I'm just under 6 foot and I found this to be too short to use comfortably - I was hunched over and had a pretty sore back after the job.The main problem is that the very nice fabric pad is attached to the head with foam.  After you hit enough splinters, the pad tears and then you're sunk.  My opinion is that they should have added a spare pad to the kit and raised the price a couple of bucks.  These pads can't be more than that to produce in bulk.Here it is, 6 months later and you still can't find replacement pads.  Note that the Deck Mate is a different product and the pads WILL NOT work on this.Cleanup was perhaps 10-15 minutes."
1771611,B002OOZERY,Great replacement for my three D cell Maglite,"I bought this to replace the three D cell Maglite that I carry in my car.  It is smaller, brighter and has a longer battery life.  Unless you insist on an adjustable beam like the Maglite has, or want a metal case, this flashlight is more than adequate to fill most needs  It is a great value for the price.  If you are putting together a kit for your car or equipping your home for the next power outage or disaster, this is a great pick.  It is small, VERY bright and has a long battery life.  You'll have to see for yourself how bright this thing is.  Sure, there are better lights out there with metal cases, adjustable beams, etc. but not at this price."
504152,B00BB5YI0Q,So far a disappointment,"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering this item. The shaver head does not pick up the hair, no matter how many times you go over it. I don't understand why someone said in their review that this is just a trimmer and not a shaver. It comes with both the trimmer head and the shaver head. I will update my review after trying the trimmer head and see if it is any better.Everything else about it seems fine, it has a hook so that you can hang it in the shower and a little travel bag."
1638078,B004LA1LKI,Blah to yuck,"Another product I was very happy to see come to Vine for review.When these crackers came to the local market I was very tempted to try them. They look delicious and I like the one big cracker approach. What always stopped me from getting them was the dang price. Not that I couldn't afford them I just could never convince myself to shell out premium dollars for a cheese cracker.Since this came through Vine, free to me to review, I don't know if that description is correct about being a 4 pack. Other crackers in this line come as 12 packs and 6 packs. Assuming that 4 pack is correct that makes the per box price, at this time, a whopping $8 bucks or so a box. Holy cow.The crackers really are a pretty good size. Not the same amount as a much cheaper bag of individual cheese crackers.The taste? Not very good. The cracker itself tastes stale. I attribute a lot of that to the multi-grain nature of the cracker. All of them had that taste so I think they just taste that way.The sharp cheddar was not able to save the day. I just didn't find it to be very sharp or very tasty.Each of the 6 packaged crackers are individually wrapped so they are perfect to toss in your lunch bag or have on the end table ready to snack on.So if cost is not a factor and you just have to have a multigrain snack then you may enjoy this. I couldn't and now I know I was wise to not purchase them."

1795215,B00540JS7C,"Nice saw, but has flaws","I bought this saw to use when installing hardwood floors in our house.  I had researched a number of saws and chose the DWS780 because of other reviews, previous experience with Dewalt tools and the shadow line feature.Reviews of many other saws either disliked either the lack of a laser or inaccuracy of the laser.  The shadow line on the DWS780 is phenomenal.  Without a doubt, it is my favorite feature.  Although difficult to see outdoors, the reviews I read of other saws with lasers had the same difficulty in daylight.I do have issues with this saw.  As with many miter saw designs, you align the blade to 90 degrees and built-in miter detents are preset for 45 degrees.  I found that the saw does not cut accurate 45 degree miters and the 45 degree detents are not adjustable.  You either have accurate 90 degree cuts or one accurate 45 degree cut.The other problem I have encountered (although I am not sure if this is a defect with my saw or a problem that would affect many) is that the plastic ring between the upper and lower tables broke within two weeks of use.  Before I realized the problem the two metal parts ground together when trying to change the miter setting.I called Dewalt support and they referred me to my local repair center.  The location is 30 miles from me and they expect me to take the saw in for repair and pick it up when completed.  60 miles driving to let them fix their problem!  If I could have returned the saw at that point, I would have.At this point, I am still within the 90 day money back satisfaction guarantee and I may still return it to Dewalt for a refund.  I understand that things break, but it would be much easier to send me the broken ring and let me replace it.  And I cannot help but wonder if the ring will break again with continued use.  I do not intend to drive 60 miles every time a plastic ring breaks.Overall, I love the shadow line feature.  But I am not sure if that is enough for me to keep the saw knowing the problems I have had thus far.UPDATE: I returned the saw to the local repair center to have the defective plastic ring replaced.  They spent about an hour replacing it so that I did not have to leave and return to pick it up.  However, before taking the saw in for repair, I noticed a burr on the aluminum base that could have caused the ring to break.  I intentionally didn't mention this when I took the saw in because I wanted to see if the repair person would look for causes of the breakage, find the burr and file it down.  They did not.  While this supposedly voids the warranty if work on the saw, I was able to remove the fence and the single bolt holding the saw to the base and file down the burr."

1294597,B0002D0CGW,picks are highly personal devices!,These just happen to be my favorite.I always keep .46mm .60mm and .73mm sizes on hand.

I hate smooth picks.Picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like.
3761484,B00BTGDR9A,Great starter kit!,"If you're low on pads, this is a great value when you need a little bit of everything.Keep in mind a single pad is going to be hard pressed to do a large job all on it's own, but this will let you try out all the Hex-Logic pads at once to see how well they perform, so you can decide which individual pads you will want in the future.The pad cleaner that it comes with is CONCENTRATED, meaning you'll want to dilute this with water or use it in a small bucket as a pre-soak. If you let your pads sit long enough for all the compound to cure inside the pad, a pre-soak is necessary and this cleaner does a good job. FWIW, you shouldn't let your pads get to that point anyways.As I said this gives you one of everything.Yellow - Heavy Cut & Levelling pad, for use with heavy cut compounds for severely damaged surfaces.Orange - Medium Cut & Heavy Polishing pad, for use with medium compounds & one-step products on damaged surfaces.White - Light Cut and general purpose polishing pad. This is probably the most versatile and well-used on good/decent paint.Blue - Pure polishing pad for use with All-in-One cleaners and glazes, will remove light imperfections and is a really good glazing pad.Black - Extra Fine finishing pad, use this with glazes and all-in-one cleaners on black/dark paint, or paint that's in extremely good shape and/or new. I personally like using this with glazes on new paint that have a sealant built in, or for use with pure sealants and cleaner-waxes.Red - This is the finest of them all, used for the very final application of wax and/or sealants. You can use it for glazes, too - but those will be more effective using the blue or black pads.And finally, the green pad - a cross between white and orange. This pad is extremely versitile and is a great all-around pad for less-than-perfect finishes. I wouldn't use this for final polishing out a black car, but it has the ability to polish out oxidation without cutting, like the orange pad. It was actually designed around ceramic and extra-hard paints that a white pad can't quite correct, and an orange pad can diminish.If only they offered this kit with the ability to choose each of the 7 pads..."

1771048,B002MPQF1O,"This is a light duty set, if by light duty, you mean useable once.","I have a Makita 18v 3AH lithium impact driver and hammer drill set. I purchased this particular driver set to fill a conspicuously 'tool kit' shaped hole in the driver kit box. It's way too big for that hole, i'm not sure what is supposed to go there.I know that impact bits are going to wear out somewhat quickly, and I know hex based drill bits make no sense, but I got this kit anyway. It seemed to be a good multi-purpose kit that could be stored in the trunk of a car. Sadly, the tool bits inside the kit are extremely fragile. The 1/8"" drill bit broke drilling into pine in a regular drill, not even the hex chucked impact driver. The first time I used a Phillips #2 bit, the tip snapped off. No biggie, they give you 8. Except when I made two decks, I was through the other 7 PH2 bits before I was a quarter of the way done with the job.After purchasing more bits to fill the holes, I found that the insert holder, the hex chucked tube that magnetically holds the 1"" insert bits, would retain the bits after being used. You need pliers to unjam the 1"" bits from the insert holder.So far, the only bits that haven't let me down, are the hole spades. I'm talking about the 3/8, 1/2 etc spade shaped bits that drill large holes in wood. They work, but they're hex chucked!The latch on the box is flimsy, and as a bonus, if you open this kit wrong, all the bits from the left side fall out. I don't know how well other kits hold up, but this one definitely doesn't."

1775085,B002YFWDXQ,Likely not to fit your window,"The nice thing about this bracket is you can install it from inside without getting on a ladder.The bad thing: It probably won't fit on your window.The design requires that you have a window sill (not all windows have one) which extends for a certain length - not too much or too little from your outside wall.  It also requires that your window not extend to high above the sill (vinyl windows have a border which seems to be too high).You will be able to install the bracket.  The problem is, the hinged support underneath won't reach your outside wall.  Or, if it does, the angle will be too shallow to provide adequate support.  Or you may get lucky.I bought two of these and it wouldn't fit properly on either apartment where I tried to install it. (the fit is hard to explain, which is probably why they didn't).They tried to make it adjustable.  There are plastic spacers and multiple screw holes. They just did a poor job."

528669,B00GMWMMV0,Horrible product...waste of materials,"It looks like the battery operated sweepers on first glance.  It is nowhere close.  It is a plastic housing with a plastic beater bar that is supposed to rotate.  The DRY Swiffer dusting pad attaches behind it.  It is awkward to turn the housing over and attach the pad....not impossible, but inconvenient and time consuming.Trying to figure out what the intent really was...a crummy beater bar brush that does not rotate hardly at all is supposed to pick up the big crumbs while the dry Swiffer pad scoops up the rest....?  No way.  Not on my linoleum kitchen floor.The handle looks nice, is shaped well.  The handle swivels the housing pretty well except when you are pushing the thing forward (its main function)...the rubber bottom coupled with the crummy beater bar brush does not allow for good control, nor smooth rolling.This item will be disassembled and put into the recycle bin...at least the plastic can be recycled into something useful."
1298478,B000FIZISQ,Beautiful guitar.  Great value!,"For under $200, I'm amazed at how nice this guitar is!  First, it was perfectly playable right out of the box - all I had to do was tune it.  And it stays in tune nicely too.I did replace the strings shortly after getting it.  There was nothing wrong with the original strings - no rust and they sounded fine - I just wanted something softer so I put on Dedario Silk and Steel light strings, which are much easier on my fingers and have a nice mellow sound.  I am a novice transitioning from a nylon string guitar so I needed the most gentle strings I could get.  Now this guitar is a joy to play.  Problem is, I get nothing done because I can't put it down!!!And the spruce top is pure eye candy as are the mahogany back and sides. And I like the mother of pearl Yahama inlay on the headstock. Very classy! The quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch.  It just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands.You can spend a lot more on a guitar, but why would you want to when you can get something like this???"

3755915,B0033A5PPO,A cardboard box would do the same thing,"This is a trapizodial box with a zipper top.  There is a wire frame you must push down to get it to stand up.  (Hint: place it on a hard flat surface to get the wire sides to stay in place.)  There is a zipper across the top, handles on the sides and cynch straps on each side to tighten ____ (?) (I have no idea.)Mine arrived incorrectly assembled.  The cynch straps ran outside the handles and made the handles unusable.  I looked at the picture on the box and realized the cynch straps were supposed to go inside the handles.  You can't unthread the cynch straps, but you can unhook them from the bottom attachment and re-run them.The ""clear"" panel on top is not clear at all.  Translucent maybe.  No chance you can see what is inside.The ""non-skid"" base is really not very effective at all - especially because the smooth fabric from the sides wraps around the bottom edges.I really don't understand the purpose of this.  A cardbox would do the same thing.  In fact, it might do it better.  This has a trapizodial shape which is smaller on the bottom than the top. This greatly reduces your ability to put things in the bottom.  It also only has a central zipper, so you can't even open the whole thing up to put in tall items.There are no internal dividers, and not even any tie down points around the outside to afix it to the floor of your trunk.Essentially, you are buying a fairly ineffective box with a THULE logo on the outside.  I, for one, am not at all impressed with this product and do not recommend it.  Two stars - not one - because the fabric, zipper and overall assembly are pretty high end."

204471,B0000U1OCI,More Cons than Pros,"I liked this at first. I REALLY did. How did it change to my giving this a ONE-STAR? The first thing I noticed about this product was it's CRAPPY clip. It looks all sleek and perfect but the clip is just there to look like it can be clipped on. Functionality-wise? TERRIBLE. So, they gave you an extra lanyard/strap that you clip on as insurance in case the clip doesn't stay on your pants' waist, belt or wherever... which falls off far too many times a day to count. The mere act of sitting down then getting up could release the clip from your clothing, so I quickly learned to constantly check that my Omron pedometer still clung to me. That safety/insurance strap saved me from losing this thing on many an occasion! Then something else started to happen...This very insurance strap/clip began to come off as well because its mini-clip began to lose friction/resistance while opening and closing. Although it didn't happen often, the fact that it did, was cause for concern. Lo' and behold, one day I was at the beach with Puppy and what do you know, I felt for my pedometer and it was missing. Needless to say it was impossible to find at the beach... My new theory is this - if you've got some washboard abs, the probability of this happening might be less. Maybe the slight pressure from my non-washboard-abs prevented this from staying clipped to my clothes? Who knows.It's sad that instead of getting into the more important features of this pedometer, I had talk about the clip! As for the functionality of the pedometer itself, it was very easy to set up and use. I liked that it had a seven-day memory function that let me see my results for each of the past seven days. It also motivated me to try and walk even more! I liked the &#34;Aerobic Steps&#34; category which measures your aerobic activity, but downside is that it started counting after 10 minutes of straight activity (this feature could be improved on because if you're interval training every few minutes, it won't measure anything as &#34;aerobic&#34;). Before losing this, I was able to use it for a good two months. Thinking back now, it was a pain to constantly have to worry about whether it fell off (also because it needs to stay upright and between certain angles in order for the pedometer to register your steps)...My suggestion would be to get the updated version of this pedometer which I recently discovered was better in all ways, including clippage. My other suggestion would be to check out the latest pedometer by Ozeri."
1171703,B00E4MCCF6,Lousy,It's too easy.  It doesn't fill up the screen.  It's too small.  No challenge.  What a waste of time.  Don't bother.
34145,B004FPBO92,Great little stylus,"First, haptic screens take some getting used to. The old style touch screens were easier to use and every pen I own had a plastic stylus.That aside, the conductive tip was at first tricky. After a month of use I've gotten used to, and even like the feel of it. The compact size is really nice for carrying around since it comes with a tether that has a headphone plug to keep it nearby (the plug is plastic, so it does not affect the jack).I've compared the width with some others and this is a bit on the skinny side, which helps with the portability, but sometimes causes it to skip when 'swiping'.It gets 5 stars because this is the design path that more products may follow; it's not perfect, but for a new type of product, it's darn close."
1963088,0784011923,And he absolutely will not stop..EVER!!...Until you are dead,"The Terminator has made it's mark in the realm of science fiction, and it shows. It's not enough that Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly cast in the title role, but his unrelenting coldness is even more explained to us through the stories and flashbacks of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese (&quot;You still don't get it, do you? He'll find her. That's what he does! That's all he does!!&quot;) Biehn's performance grabs me every time I see it, just as Arnold's agressive coldblooded behavior also draws my attention. And in the middle is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who sees her normal life slip away in a matter of hours, (&quot;Come on, do I look like the Mother of the future? I mean am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook&quot;)yet is still able to draw strength from her pain and loss and fight to stay alive. It doesn't get much better than this, folks.I wish people would stop being so hard on the special effects of this film. You can't compare it to T2. The Terminator had a shoestring budget of $6 million, while T2's budget was something like $80 million. Of course the special effects are better in the sequel...especialy when you've got an extra $74 million to spend this time around. Instead, people should be commending the hard work Stan Winston and company gave on The Terminator effects. Sure, that's not Arnold's face when he takes his eye out, but hey,...not bad. In fact it doesn't even look half bad when he puts his glasses back on just before the real Arnold is put back on camera wearing his glasses. The arm surgery is very impressive. I remember as a kid I couldn't watch that scene because you can see a vein wrapped around the metel skeleton while he's working on fixing his fingers. Looks pretty realistic to me. Take these things into consideration the next time you want to take pot shots at the visual effects of the film.With the new 5.1 Surround Sound Mix newly created on this DVD, there's a lot to talk about. First off, the remixed sounds of most of the guns and explosions have been changed. The 44 Longslide with laser sighting sounds completely different when Arnold fires it. Same goes for the Oozie 9MM, Reese's shotgun, the whole ball of wax. At first you might be destracted by the changes since we're so use to the mono version. And since this DVD also includes the mono version, you can go back and forth and listen to the differences. The explosions, such as the giant armored machines of the future being destroyed, sound terrific. They really put a lot of work into making these explosions even more memorable. It almost reminds me of how George Lucas redid the explosion of the first Death Star for the special edition of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, except we don't get any additional visual effects to go along with it, just better sound.Yes, it's true that you don't get as many extra features like you do on T2, (here in the USA, both T1 &amp; T2 are on one disc with one side used for the film and the other side used for the extras) but still, it's nice to have them. I think most would say that the deleted scenes are the best asset. The only shot of Arnold that was deleted was after he killed the other Sarah Connor, you see him go back to his car very slowly..not in a hurry..and drive away. Very very creepy. The other scenes range from Lt. Traxler (Paul Winfield) beginning to believe Kyle's story is true, to scenes with Kyle &amp; Sarah fighting over doing something to the Cyberdyne Company as we witness Kyle breaking down because it's so hard for him to look at the green grass and the trees, because in his world it's all gone. Director James Cameron explains that it is a good scene but decided that he didn't want Reese breaking down more than once and he already does that right before the love scene, which could not be cut. And of course, there is the deleted scene of discovering that the factory that the Terminator was destroyed in was actually Cyperdyne Systems. We see one man find the CPU chip and put it in his pocket, but it was better to cut all this out and use it to better advantage for the sequel. Throw in a few trailers &amp; TV spots(the teaser trailer reveals that the original title was just &quot;Terminator&quot;, not &quot;The Terminator&quot;), some short retrospective documentaries (although the original &quot;making of&quot; that's been out on video is not present), storyboards, script ect...and you've got a pretty well rounded special edition.  But wait!  There's more!There are also some hidden features on the disc, located on Side 1. Just go to the Special Features section and then choose DVD-ROM Features. Once there, take your remote control and type in the following numbers (very slowly): 5, 1, 2, 8, 4, &amp; 1. (These numbers stand for the date of the Terminator and Kyle Reese's arrival (May 12, 1984) You'll be taken to a special hidden 2 page section, with about 29 different topic interviews done by James Cameron, Michael Biehn and others.  The interviews are done with slide pictures and not real video.  The topics range from how two kids actually played the part of the little boy who takes Sarah's picture for $4, Hemdales lack of faith in the picture, technical aspects, deleted scenes, to comaparisons to T2 ect.  Very interesting stuff.  Plus, on page 2 there is some reading material on a topic called &quot;Chrono-Surfing: A Brief History of Time Travel&quot;, written by Randall Frakes (co-author of The Terminator novelization).  So those of you scoffing about the lack of extras should check this material out.  It's a very nice &quot;Easter Egg&quot; find.  Plus, get the DVD soon and receive a fancy lithograph cover case of Arnold.The Terminator...A Sci-Fi Classic!&quot;I'll be back&quot; - Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator"
1362438,B0009WH7C8,Good game,"EIB is a very good game, in single player it nearly matches the feelings of immersion generated by Call of Duty.  The missions are well-connected and challenging as well as being slightly non-linear.  One of my few complaints about this game is that the design nearly makes the gun sights of human players pointless, it is nearly impossible to actually take aim and hit an enemy at any range, it is sometimes better just to blaze away.  While the prior is something that I think could be improved upon, the focus of the game is tactics rather than shooting.  In multiplayer this game surpasses Call of Duty in my opinion.  I have only a 56k connection and so its nearly impossible for me to play any online games, and since COD does not have any type of cooperative play it is not as extendable as EIB proves to be.  With several Coop modes available the gameplay potential of this game is realized more fully than most FPS's.  While this game is not the best ever released it does provide some fun and, for people who enjoy WWII themes it provides another outlet for your entertainment and the tactical planning required to win, while fairly simple is also simply realistic."
1851848,B000028U0Y,"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash","What can be said about this album?  It's one of the greatest live album of all time, one of the great country albums of all time, and one of Johnny Cash's ""must have"" albums.  Johnny performs before a ""captive"" audience, and holds them in the palm of his hand.  Some of these inmates may not have been country music fans, but they were definitely Johnny Cash fans.  There was just something about him that the prisoners could relate to.  It probably helped that a lot of the songs here are about prisoners.  Not that this is a somber concert, by any means.  It's actually a joyous event, with Johnny cracking jokes and singing several humerous songs.  The CD adds three bonus tracks that were cut from the original album, due to time constraints.  The curse words are also uncensored this time around.  Highly recommended."
1298219,B000EEEYCW,Yak...,"There are better tuners out there. Far better. This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using ""F"" or ""C"" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings. Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere."
1756198,B001CELJQM,Lasts for about 2 weeks,I ordered these as the original one I purchased was over 5 years old & lost some of the butterflies. It still works. The new replacements seemed to be the perfect replacement until I set them up on my patio table in full sun. After 2 weeks the batteries died. I replaced them to find the solar charger stopped recharging the batteries & they stay on day & night until the batteries drain.I thought these would be as good as the original but they fail to work in 2 weeks. Seems to be poor workmanship or defective parts but they are terrible. I would never recommend these to anyone.

The cable is soft and flexible and I could not tell any difference in sound from the custom cable I had been using (that's a good thing, my other cable was very expensive).The connectors are not gold plated but it's an inexpensive cable, it's not pretending to be anything other than a decent low-cost XLR two-conductor shielded cable.

2029369,0792839242,This franchise is stupid enough already.,This movie sucks. It took over ten years to be made.

1855371,B00004YWGC,What can I say?,"I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a ""nice girl"" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a ""bad girl"" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the ""bad girl"" because she's a slut, so you go back to the ""good girl."" But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it.Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm ""wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e."
1295089,B0002E1G5C,Hasn't made things any easier,"I honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. First, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. And as for the winder... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. Didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. Just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.Each time I have set out to use it, I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set(the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, I'll try the notch bridge peg puller. But other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;."
3650109,B001411SK0,Not bad.. pellets can be sprayed off and reused a few times,"We have four cats; one of which decided to stop using the litter box we had. So we tried the Breeze. She took to it easily, and hasn't had any more accidents. Although the supplies are a bit more expensive than regular cat litter, I found that the pellets are durable enough that you can take the whole litter box outside every 2-4 weeks, remove the bottom ""pee"" tray and any turds in the box, then spray the pellets off with a water hose, at least a couple times. Let them dry, then add a few new pellets. Also, the bottom ""pee tray is reversible, so if your kitty always pees in one spot, you can turn the tray around to make it last longer. You might also try putting a little crystal cat litter on top of the pad, if you need it to last longer. Baking soda doesn't hurt, either. Anyway, maybe these tips will help save you some money on supplies.Pros: the pellets are fairly large, and generally don't end up scattered all over your floor.Cons: since the turds are not completely encased in cat litter as they normally are with clumping cat litter, there is more of a doo-doo odor in the air after your precious feline companion has been in the box, grimacing as they empty the loggified contents of their dinner into the box. You'll be wanting to scoop it soon after. We use one-gallon zip-lock bags to store the turds in, instead of flushing. I guess it depends upon whether the box is near a toilet or not. If you have several cats, you may need more than one box."

(When away, I use a brush/scraper combo thing.) So I was pleased to try this out. It makes light work of pushing the snow off the car, and I love it for that. Additionally, for scraping, the long handle makes scraping go a bit easier in places. I think I am going to be very happy to have this this winter. Four stars because it's just not excellent... the foam end will wear out and as another reviewer said, the scraper end ends up at an odd angle, relative to the foam end. But I like it.Pros:1. Long length and large foam rectangle means you can push snow off quickly.2. Long handle was also helpful for scrapingCons:1. Blue foam end is probably just the right thing, but it doesn't seem durable2. The two ends should be at the same angle, but are at 90 degree angles.Overall, I found it to be a helpful tool, and I'm happy to have it this winter."

I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.If you have a black car, and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics.

1624024,B003YBLF2E,Not so tasty,"My honest opinion of this snack box is that the items in the pack were not good picks to fulfill a meal. I understand the intention of GoPicnic putting the pack together to offer a variety of interesting and nutritious snacks; however, as a meal, I do not rate this snack pack as great. Individual items in the box were great, such as two pieces of dark chocolate, crackers, and nut and dry fruit mix (which is a bit too sweet for my overall taste although the ginger made up for it), but altogether, each item is a snack, and essentially you are eating a meal consisting of snacks, which I do not feel is an ideal meal (maybe as a last resort meal, but not as a take-to-work meal). The least likeable item was the salmon spread. Perhaps others rated this spread as favorable, but in my opinion, the spread is a tad salty, and it did not leave a  complimentary taste in my mouth. Overall, the pack is convenient, but I recommend a consumer eat each snack individually and not as a meal. Of course, if you generally eat snacks as a meal, then this pack is for you.On a positive note, the snack pack is cute, includes a plenty of tasty healthful snacks, and is not too pricy, but I would not pay $4 for the pack. I might go for a wholesale buy if offered, but not as a single-time purchase. Therefore, the pack isn't too bad, but I wouldn't recommend it as a meal to anyone; I'd simply recommend it for what it is: a combination of decent snacks."
1605827,B002DHL8DG,An excellent cereal and a good way to start your day!,We try to eat a light and healthy breakfast in the morning and it usually consists of either a cup of Cheerios with  cup of skim milk or a cup of this Special K cereal with skim milk.  We like this tasty cereal as the flakes are crispy and large and the berries just add enough extra flavor to brighten up the taste.Some days if we are cutting back we might even have a bowl for dinner to help us watch our calories.  This is a good cereal and we like it a lot. Each bowl is only 150 calories with the skim milk and it gives you the boost of energy to start your day without filling up too much by eating a larger breakfast.  You are getting no cholesterol and 3 grams of fiber with 2 grams of protein and 9 grams of sugar.This is a great product and I recommend it to you.  I have posted a copy of a couple of photos that might be informative for you.Just an added note:  We always measure our cereal every morning with a cup and we only got 6 servings out of the box when it claims to have 10 servings per box.  Even if our measurements were slightly off there is  no way we were off by that much. This is still a great tasting cereal but the box did not seem full.

3070220,B001DZOC3W,Stars for the BD options and quality...,"I had really high hopes for this one in wanting MNS to make a popular and successful film that customers will want to see. Every once in awhile I do an in-store sampling (random customers watch the films on the HD display and give feedback) prior to release to see how the release might fare (big mistake with this one).Out of 136 customers who filtered through last night whilst displaying the movie, 100 said they will not be renting or buying it now, 25 outright walked away laughing and several kids liked it. Needless to say, this movie was very disappointing. The lead performances, storyline, special effects, and writing were all sadly poor and subpar. Those stories I heard about in theaters of people laughing when the movie had meant to scare you or make you feel sad rang true here too. What I did notice was an unplanned target audience materialized - 12 to 14 year olds. Each kid liked it due to either the corny scare factor or the fake gore. Seven or eight 15-16 year olds walked through that had already seen it and all stated the movie sucked.So anyway, technically the BD has some nice offerings. All the featurettes and extra tidbits are as they are listed here, and most are in 1080. The trivia track actually turned out to be boring on the facts, but it does allow you to incorporate all of the extra features on the disc while watching the film. The deleted scenes were mercifully removed as they were atrocious, and as MNS admitted in the intros to them - they detracted from the film he had wanted people to see - especially all the extra gore. One thing on this BD I had not seen before was the ability to mute the main menu music (if left idling). The wind effects sound great on the DTS HD, and the transfer looked flawless; so much so that the CGI effects looked really bad.I can see why this movie fared poorly, and I know ZD and Marky Mark are way better actors than they show here. The best summary I can come up with is: that volumes of people kept laughing as they listened to the film (while shopping in the store); Mostly due to how corny all the acting/lines/character interaction sounded, let alone how bad it looked while watching it. Watch it for the sound and clarity - skip it for every other reason thinkable."

1300257,B001G3TJXO,Voodoo Lab power supply didn't fit as advertised.,"My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. However, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. The fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. There's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. I wasn't worried about this, since I doubt I'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. Once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. You'll probably have to break them. It's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this. Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. You can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, I wish I could return this board - except I can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)Basically, I paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. Needless to say, I'm not very pleased."

163814,B00CTVIWQW,Would not reccomend,"UPDATED: Just wanted to add an update, after about a week of use. This skin looks horrible now, wrinkles are everywhere, and I have a sort of blister looking spot too as it doesnt seem to hold up to s-pen use at all. I wouldn't reccomend this at all to anyone, I doubt I have a bad one, but it just seems to rubbery and stretchy to be titled as HD Clear and anti-bubble.ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a decent skin but not as good as a bodyguardz. I have tried this brand and I believe another brand I tried was Armor Shield, and this is a good skin for the price, but i have not seen any comparable to Bodyuardz. These are just a hair thinner which seems to give you more noticable wrinkles and they can get warped if you squeegee them too hard while installing... Other than that, they adhere well and do the job good. I have mine on with a TPU case and it doesnt flare on any corners like some other brands do."

1364122,B000AA5WRQ,awful campaign mode,"Why does relic spend so much effort and money developing such a sophisticated and exciting RTS platform and then give it a campaign mode that is just a confusing goatf$#k of massed enemies and nonsensical storylines?  The game was designed to reward subtly matching unit types to enemy strategies, but the campaign mode is just a wave after wave of mixed units that must be endured with no time or even need to plan a defense.  I feel like I've been given a set of surgical tools and then told I have 10 minutes to cut dow a tree with them; the sophistication of the tools makes the brutish nature of the task all the more frustrating.

1528606,B00D96BJSO,"Compared to XP Seven, SteelSeries H Wireless, and other TBs","For a short review, if all you want is XBox One capability, with the mild added benefit of mobile device compatibility, then the XO Seven should be on your short list of headsets. The sound from the Xbox One is as high quality as the XP Sevens I have for $120 less (MSRP).If you are looking for true 5.1 or 7.1 support, move on. This set is NOT for you. It uses the same tech as the MS wireless stereo headset, and is hindered by the same requirements as that set - so stereo only audio out.If you are looking for Xbox One and other console support, move on. This set is NOT for you. These are the only reasons these are 4 stars and not 5 - many other headsets, for a few dollars more (XP Sevens excluded, though they are more than a few dollars more!) can offer multiplatform capability and can do 5.1. I wanted to give these a 3 because of these short falls, but the audio quality really is quite high and saved it from the fate of a 3.Longer review:Unboxing Turtle Beach headsets is pretty much all the same, though that being said, they do a good job making you feel like the headset is quality. The box has a cardboard wrapper on it, held on with 2 pieces of tape. Pull this tape off, and the headset is enclosed in a nice box, held shut with a magnet. Inside, the headset is held in place with custom formed plastic, with the Xbox One headset adapter (yes, the SAME adapter you can buy separately for $25 MSRP) is held in the center of the set. Under the plastic you will find the manuals and a box with all of the accessories. Overall, it's a nice experience unboxing any TB headset, and the XO Seven is no exception.Actually using the XO Seven is painfully simple. Well, as long as your Xbox One has the March 04, 2014 update and your controller's firmware has been updated. If not, it's still pretty simple.To update your firmware on the Xbox One, simply connect it to the Internet and it should pull the update down. Once downloaded, plug the chat adapter into a powered off controller, plug the small end of a microUSB cable into the controller, and pull out the batteries. Plug the controller into the system's USB port. Power up the Xbox One. In some instances, the Xbox One will automatically update the controller. If it doesn't update automatically, power on and go toSettings -> System -> Update controller and then follow the onscreen instructions. Once completed, you are ready to rock and don't need to do this process again unless you purchase a new controller.After you have your controller updated, simply plug the included adapter into the headset, plug in the mic if you want game chat, then plug the headset into the controller. You should now hear stereo audio from the XO Seven in game.One thing you will notice is that I say it is stereo audio. That's because... it's stereo audio only. Despite other headsets using the 5.1 signals of other consoles, notably the XP Seven, the XP 500, the PSX4 and the SteelSeries H, the XO Seven uses the same technology as Microsoft's stereo wireless headset, meaning it is stereo capable ONLY. If you want 5.1 support, you will need to use optical out, another model headset with 5.1 capability and purchase a Chat Adapter for the XBox One. Chat would be stereo but sound should come out in 5.1 (or 7.1) as long as you change the audio option in the Xbox One's configuration.The thing is, the audio quality, even if ""only"" stereo, is quite nice. I believe the 50mm speakers are the same as the ones in the XP Seven, and I love the quality from those. The XP Seven is more expensive because it can do multiplatform and has a programmable DSP which the ""watered down"" XO Seven does not offer. If you want 5.1 and a nicely programmable DSP, pony up the extra cash for the XP Sevens and the Xbox One Chat Adapter.Comparing these to the XP Sevens, the only differences are the programmable DSP, Xbox One chat capability out of the box, and the 5.1 capability. Be aware the XP Sevens are fully wired as they are aimed at the pro gaming circuit. The audio quality seems to be on par other than the stereo vs 5.1 part of the equation. You can get Xbox One chat compatibility with the Xbox One Chat Adapter. Be aware, because the XP Sevens use optical output, you can get 5.1 audio to the XP Sevens, unlike the XO Sevens.Comparing these to the SteelSeries H Wireless, well, the audio quality on the H is simply astounding. It's wireless, it costs more and isn't directly compatible with the Xbox One chat without the adapter, but if you have the money to spend, and want what I consider the highest audio quality available in gaming audio, then you want the H with the Xbox One Chat Adapter. The H series is wireless, therefore it needs to be charged, which is something the XO Seven doesn't need to worry about. It is powered by the controller and chat adapter.Comparing these to the X41s, the XO Seven sound quality is better by a fair margin. This is to be expected given the 5 years span since the X41s were released. And the X41s have to deal with a LOT of interference. They are NOT recommend by me any longer, so if you want Xbox One capability, the XO Seven wins hands down compared to them.Comparing these to the PX 51s, the price is much better for the XO Sevens, but that's because the XO Seven doesn't do multiplatform support. The PX51s are more geared toward Playstation 3 and 4 gaming, but can be used on the 360 and with the Xbox One chat adapter, work with the Xbox One w/ chat, not just audio. They are optical audio based, with a wireless DSP base station to send audio to the headset, so even on launch day you could get game audio from the Xbox One on these. With the new Xbox One Chat Adapter, you can also get Xbox One support on these. The price for the PX 51s is high compared to the XO Seven, but sound quality seems to be the same to my ears, minus the 5.1 capability of the PX 51s.The last comparison I have is to the PX4 headset. Again, the 50mm driver seems to be the same as the XO Seven here, so the speakers are all the same across the TB line if they are 50mm. So if you own the PX4, just buy the Xbox One Chat Adapter and you'll essentially have the same capability as the XO Sevens... with 5.1 capability. The price point is where I would say the PX 4 is the better choice here, unless you know you will only ever own an Xbox One and don't care about any other platform.One thing to note, another way I've compared the headsets is by connecting them to my PC. I've listened to all sorts of music to compare each headset to the other using optical out where needed, or in the case of the wired XO Sevens, plugged them directly into my headphone amp. I've listened to Moody Blues, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, Deicide, Primus, Urusen, The Beatles, various J-Pop bands, Pink Floyd and other music, listening to each track on each headset one after the other. I can't honestly hear a difference between the headsets from TB, but truly love the SteelSeries H and would recommend them over all others... IF price is not a factor!Final thoughts:The XO Sevens are great headphones, offering Xbox One capability out of the box. This is a blessing and a curse, as it literally only supports the Xbox One. There is no way to get multiplatform support with these. At all. And that's disappointing to me, given the price compared to the PX4 that does offer mutliplatform support and seems to have the same speakers. I believe the PX4s are giving the same 5.1 sound as my Xbox 360 and PS3 on the One as well, so there's another down side.Plus:Xbox One supportGreat sound qualityCons:Stereo ONLYOnly supports Xbox OneWith Xbox One Chat Adapter, the PX4 becomes a much more viable option and offers multiplatform support"

3745585,B000AMLWH8,No real cleaning power,"Meguiar's Quik is cheap, which is great as long as your interior is already pretty clean. It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it's own beyond that of water. In other words, it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth. Any dirt that can't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put. It does have a nice scent, which dissipates in a matter of hours. You'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers."
1298660,B000KIRT6A,"OK for experimentation, but for less noise, go elsewhere","if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. Pay the extra money and get something quiet. Others complained about this and they were right. If you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. Some complained about each band boosting others. This is more of a user problem than manufacturing. If you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. In this respect, its like an MXR 6 band."

1856227,B00005AAXE,"""What the world needs now is another self-obsessed emo-whiner...""","Don't be fooled by a name. With all due respect to the additional musicians who contributed to this disk, Dashboard Confessional is hardly a band. Chris Carrabba stands (or sits, on a stool) center stage, sings everything, plays guitar, and writes and arranges all of the music, so it is essentially a one man show. The guy appears to have talent, and legions of devoted fans seem dedicated to letting him know this. Carrabba would be a pretty good songwriter, too, but he desperately needs a few new topics to sing about. If you're twenty-five or under, and have a really, really bad broken heart, then you probably will not agree with me on this, but everyone else should take heed. This guy is stuck in a rut that I doubt he will ever be able to dig himself out of. You don't need to be a $100 an hour analyst to recognize this, either. After a full CD of high-tempered whining, Carrabba's broken heart grows extremely tiresome to all except the faithfully depressed.Chris Carrabba is the emo Dan Hill (remember ""Sometimes When We Touch""? Yeah, him.). His songs are powerful, pretty, melodic, quasi-literate, and ultimately, banal. Every single track on Places You Have Come to Fear the Most is an expression of Carrabba's pain. Ultimately, listening to this entire disk leaves the impression that this guy has nothing else to sing about except his own hurt feelings; if he didn't have a broken heart, he'd have nothing left to say. In this sense (and he's probably going to hate this comparison even more than my Dan Hill dig), Carrabba's album reminds me of the first Melissa Etheridge album, where every song was about a screwed up relationship. He'd be lucky if he was like her, though, because at least she was eventually able to stretch out a bit. Carrabba doesn't yet show this much promise.With all of this whining, and so much yowling about his broken heart, Carrabba never once uses the word `love' to describe his own state of mind. So, if he's not at all committal, what does he have to complain about? Not to overanalyze, but this is music for people who are in love with the pain caused by self-pity. On ""The Best Deceptions"", he sings, ""I'd rather say nothing. I'd rather you never heard my voice."" Agreed. Instead, maybe I'll ask him to listen to some unsolicited advice from me. Chris, find somebody nice. Fall in love. Get happy. Then, get a day job. Oh, and P.S. - After singing that title track, you might want to see a throat doctor, too.  C  Tom Ryan"

It's like a 10 year old made the game and then the EA staff put flashy graphics on it.

But to my surprise, it only lasts 90 days! I'm not sure I fully understand this, if the product vapors a corrosion protection on the contents of the toolbox then why does it have to be replaced? The only reason I can think of is that if the tools are used then the protection is lost. There are tool box drawer liners that do not have time limitations that would be significantly cheaper in the long run. And it is only good for 2 cubic feet of space, it says that this is the size of an average tool box, most of mine are quite a bit bigger than that. Wiping tools down with an oily rag would also be a lot cheaper. If this product lasted for a year, it might be worthwhile but there are so many other cheaper ways to protect tools and equipment from rust and corrosion. But if you have an enclosure or equipment that cannot be protected any other way, then this product might be worthwhile (if you can remember to replace it and have access to it)."

1495579,B005DVAB0A,Lol all the people complaining just played the demo.,"There's no possible way one could say this is an easy button-mashing game unless they're playing the demo and on Hero. I'm playing the full game on Hard and I'm looking up strategies to beat certain bosses, even though I've completed all previous modern NG's on Master Ninja.I'd like to say, compared to the graphical style of NG1/NG Black, NG2, and NG Sigma/NG Sigma 2, which all featured the same graphical style which was cool (all DOA's prior to 5 had the same thing, with there being minute differences in texture between a couple of games, like between DOA3 and DOA2U, NG1 and NG Black, NG2 and NG Sigma 2, etc.). However, there is no doubt ever since Tecmo Koei formed and they started making console games from scratch (like NG3 and DOA5 - not counting DOA:D and NG Sigma 2 since they're either non-console games or better editions), the graphics have become more realistic. Quality seems to be the same, but now it looks realer. It's now comparable to the likes of Tekken, Soul Calibur, Virtua Fighter and so forth. FotNS: Ken's Rage is another such Tecmo Koei game. This is good. When trying to imitate 3D and reality, you should rather make your game resemble real life and not clay/wax figures.Now onto the gameplay, which is what's ticking off many. First I'll mention NG2/NG Sigma 2 also had ""QTE"" which you would execute about half the time - it's usually easy to amputate an enemy in those games long as they aren't stronger versions of their inferiors, and once that's done, it's QTE time. Many bosses are also vulnerable to it (though a lot less than enemies), yet, where'd the complaints go about this in the NG2 pages? Maybe I missed it - oh well, I think it's cool since it's a way to add some cinematic-like instances in gameplay. I mean look at God of War III and Asura's Wrath...their amounts of QTE put this game's to shame and yet look how much they're praised, lol. I like that it's different with this game. I'd rather have a change than a rehash of NG1 and/or NG2. All the butthurt here are either narrow-minded or unable to adapt.As far as depth of techniques for the weapons (which by the way, contrary to what so many of complainers here said, are not limited to the Dragon Sword - there're the claws and scythe now, and the BotAF (Blade of the...) which is slightly different than the DS), they are about as deep in complexity as with NG2/NG Sigma 2, and not any less.This game's a lot more brutal than any other NG, in the way Hayabusa fights and in gore amount (which, by the way will splatter on the screen if you're close enough making it seem you're looking through a camera lens, which is cool) present.As far as the difficulty of this game, I'm inclined to believe the crybabies here have not played the game on a difficulty higher than Hero and for longer than an hour, for once they play the game on Hard and count the number of times it took them to defeat Regent (of the Mask) the first time through, without looking up strategies online, then maybe they'll get quiet. I will mention once again I have completed NG Black/NG2/both Sigmas on MN and fighting Regent was akin to my first attempt at first form Alma in 2004.The enemies are only ""defenseless and scared"" when you've either disarmed them or they're too badly injured to fight anymore and can think of nothing but the pain, which again is an element of realism. You can finish them off at this point with either the press of [] or ^, but regarding injury, it was the same with the NG2's - just finish them off with ^ (Y for 360). The only difference was the fear of the soldiers (terrorists)in NG3. In the NG2's every enemy tried to kill you even after being badly injured/amputated, but that's because you've been either fighting fiends/fiendish-like creatures, ninjas, or ninja-like soldiers the whole time, which if you think about it, will always try to kill you regardless. Something like regular British terrorists? Of course they're more human and will stop thinking about killing you when their pain has reached high levels. That's just regarding them though, but other more cold-blooded soldiers, ninjas, and so forth, will not be asking you to spare them. They'll squirm due to being fatally injured, but that's it. I think that's almost as cool as how they kept trying to kill you in the NG2's. However, the damage they (the ""near-dead"" enemies) dealt was broken.The only beef I have so far with this game is regarding the controls, and consistency. Like sometimes I'll find that my ""bird"" jump (or whatever it's called where you jump forward with a blue aura) right after a ground slide isn't pulling off always and it reads that I just pressed X or something. Perhaps I have to time it better since it might've read a ""ground-slide"" attack instead, or maybe the simultaneous-ness is more strict - not sure. It seems like half the time it won't even read that I was holding down the left stick in some direction I knew I was holding it in. Regarding consistency, I noticed I don't always see the prompts on screen during the same QTE. Sometimes they show, sometimes not. When they stopped for a while, I figured the game was just like ""ok, we told you enough by now what to do during this certain QTE, so we'll stop telling you"" but weirdly enough later on doing the same QTE, it shows up again. Wtf? The game just can't make up its mind, and it has nothing to do with when I'm pressing the button. It literally sometimes shows and not at other times, which is annoying. Also, some of the prompts can be misleading. For instance sometimes it'll ask you to press ^, but X would also work just fine. Wtf? You're asking me to press ^ right? Why would X work then? Shouldn't you say ""^ or X"" then, which would look stupid? Whatever. It's also somewhat unpredictable WHEN the QTE will initiate...throwing you off. I hate that. I would love to know when it will start, but there's just no way it seems. It happens randomly in battle. My biggest sub-beef in this big beef is the misleading part I mentioned.In the manual it also doesn't go over how to scroll through the techniques list - I had to manually research that myself online and found answers on forums, which shows I'm not the only one who was confused about it. Luckily I found the answer.I was also slightly confused regarding what the NG3 data in the PS3's ""Game Utility"" and ""Save Utility"" served, except the game's ""Save Data"" for obvious reasons, but that's not really the fault of the game. What is the fault of the game however, is how it KEEPS telling you each time you load the game, that the last update you installed added this and this feature...which is another annoying thing Tecmo needs to get off their behinds for and fix.All in all this game gets a 4 so far. If it weren't for the shaky controls and forgivable bugs I would surely have given this an earned 5. All the cinematics are epic and I'm a cutscene freak. Hayabusa's also more revealing (showing face sometimes, etc.) and the game dives into his character more, which the previous games didn't do. This NG literally has THE best story, and I'm just on Day 5 like I said and I'm already saying that. It's already more interesting than Itagaki's ""Hayabusa kills men, fiends and gods in his way and will kick your ass too and steal your GF if he feels like it"" plots, which I still liked, but Hayashi has verily impressed me with his version, and his DOA is already turning out better than any of Itagaki's.To all the complainers saying this isn't like the previous NG's, save your money, stfu and go play said games. Why you would pay ~$50 extra dollars for practically the same thing with slightly different enemies with a slightly different plot and slightly different movesets is truly beyond me.P.S. Amazon, it would be helpful if you SPECIFY what part of a review you consider too inappropriate to be posted instead of having me re-read my whole bloody review and figure out what might need to be changed. Retail sites these days."

They ""hang out"" in the kitchen area which is right off the main hallway leading from the reception area to the kennel building. When ever we brought a dog to or from the kennel, two of my big dogs would go crazy. I bought two collars and put them on low shock. It only took 2 or 3 times before they learn not to go crazy. I am very please with the results from this collar. Would highly recommend it!!"

Tried massage therapy, which over the years has helped, this time the massage did not seem to do much good and I was going once a week which got to be too expensive.Thank goodness for Prospera, it has really brought me relief, I've used it every day and am still on the set of pads they send with the unit.If you suffer with neck/shoulder, joint pain, back pain, do yourself a favor and buy one of these.I made a small investment and have received so much benefit from this product.Thumbs Up Prospera."

507364,B00BUTIELM,May jump start your diet.,"Raspberry Ketones, the Lipo-Metabolic Burner as being touted by Dr. Oz, are supposed to break-down fats in the human body. These capsules from Summit Nutritions deliver 500-mg of the target compound. I would advise anyone new to this product to start off with only 1 cap per day as opposed to the 2 serving size in the facts box.Generally speaking, but not noted on the label it is recommended limiting the consumption of additional caffeine while using this product to less than three 8-oz cups of coffee per day. The supplement also comes with a warning that it&#8217;s not to be used by nursing mothers.There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that Raspberry Ketone is a good way to jump start your weight loss diet but, as always, when used in conjunction with sensible diet and exercise. It claims to increase calorie burning (thermogenesis) and fat burning (fat oxidation). I have used this product before and found the first 10 pounds came off a little easier than on previous weight loss regiments."

I was helping a stranded motorist get his stalled car towed into a lot, and at first I fumbled with it, getting the cinch bone positioned properly and just making sure it was going to stay put.It did work though, and it kept me from getting any nasty knots or anything tying it up (I just have one of these...on the other end I ran the whole tow cable through the loop to keep it cinched, but obviously that only works on one end).I might get another just to make it even easier to cinch both ends, but one worked fine for me so I'll probably stick with that."

The light effect matched with music harks back, I suppose, in a simplistic way,  to the go-go effects of the 1960's and then the strobes and light shows of the disco era that followed ... but it is not a major attraction for my tastes.  The sound quality is not the best and maybe it's just me, but I have a strong preference for a volume control on every product that I use, independently."

2473290,B00005JKJA,Lynch's Most Provocative,"One thing is for certain - when you watch something done by David Lynch, you'd better pay attention!  This movie inverts the protagonists-try-to-unravel-the-mystery cliche to present a story wherein the mystery/fantasy slowly dissolves into the real story, and the central characters are not revealed to us until the movie's final half-hour.  Still, this remains an enigmatic experience that disturbs and provokes, as Lynch's films always do.  Also, great performances all around."

1303978,B00J4TBMVO,I'm a BIG Fan of Elixir Strings... But...,"I was looking forward to trying these, as I've loved this company's product since day one.But I think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;HD&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. More profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.I have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. The bottom dropped out, the top end stopped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pick.When I play with fingers it's better, but not worth spending more money on than the normal .012s I've been using (which I think I liked a lot better).It's possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but I'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.Again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;HD&#34; moniker... no thanks."

Obviously a lot of the construction is plastic, but the inner metal portion doesn't feel very solid either.  I haven't tried, but it seems like you could pry this off with a crow-bar.Some of you will note that this type of lock is usually meant to discourage (not prevent) a thief.  In this aspect, the lock met my expectations.  Still, I can't see someone being overly discouraged by this lock.As far as postiives, I like that the key hole has a cover, and after using this for about a year, I haven't noticed any fading or discoloration.Buy it, if you like, or consider a more expensive (and more secure) option.

3093051,B001JV5AYK,"A Chilling Thriller From The Screenwriter Of ""The Three Musketeers."" A Plot Point Remains Obscure, Though.","The latest screenplay from David Loughery (who wrote the script for the fun Disney film ""The Three Musketeers"") is riddled with an obscure plot point. SPOILER WARNING AHEAD: Did Abel actually kill his wife and her boss? Because how else could he have known what wounds her boss had, if he only received a phone call about his wife being in a head-on collision? SPOILER WARNING OVER!!! One thing I didn't like about this movie was that the sister and brother seemed to hate each other, there was absolutely NO love between them. Kerry Washington (""Ray"") and Patrick Wilson (""The Phantom Of The Opera"") are entirely believable as the interracial couple. Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely frightening here, albeit slightly less so than in ""Jackie Brown."" I didn't give it 5 stars because of the obscure plot point afore-mentioned.

354035,B0029LHHP4,Chemical Smell Goes Away!!,"I'm starting to doubt amazon reviewers, they are pretty off on this one. I was very skeptical to buy this product after reading soooo many reviews that reference the terrible chemical smell. I agree, the product does have a very strong smell at first. Luckily, I usually sleep with only my upper head on the pillow (is that abnormal?) so my nose isn't stuffed into the pillow. Anyways, I have had the pillow for 5 days now and I have to say the chemical smell has gone down at least 80%. You have to stuff your face deep into the pillow to even smell it ever so faintly. I have confidence the smell will go away entirely very quickly. The other common complaint- the firmness of the pillow. I'm not sure if the people who purchased the pillow fully understand what they order. This is a memory foam pillow. It is not meant to be super soft. It will contour to your head just enough, but won't collapse entirely. If you wanted this, then get a regular pillow??? I usually like very soft pillows and I was very pleased with this pillow. Keeps my head at a good level and is very comfortable. So, potential buyers, beware of the validity of the complaints. I urge you to purchase the pillow and try it yourself before writing it off completely."

1878187,B001CJOHG6,"Moody, edgy, soulful r&b","You can't judge this album too harshly. It's not perfect,and i see i'm not the only one who heard a little Lauryn Hill in the mix, but still Jazmine has writting credits on i think, all the songs and she does bring her own production/writing style to the mix. Really there are only a couple songs that fall short. Her use of strings and other classical instruments is commendable. When she sings in her lower register she delievers chills, but unfortunately i think some of the higher wailing she does is out of her range, i know that the raspy aspect is meant to sound soulful, but sometimes, it's just annoying.  songs like ""Call me guilty"" make me think of an Eminem, in the lyrical content, and switch too, makes me think of his twisted humor. She's very honest, and unafraid to say exactly what she's thinking. over all, really impressive debut."

1769760,B002IP4PA6,My last Moen faucet,"This will be my third, and final Moen faucet, I think, at least concerning their low end stuff (assuming they have a higher end line even).First impressions right out of the box are that this is a REALLY cheaply made product.  So much plastic, that I have my doubts about how long this will last.  The current, &#34;goose neck&#34; designed Moen we have in our kitchen sink currently is leaking from the spout of the pull out wand head, and there doesn't seem to be any way to get to the parts that likely need replacing to fix it (i.e. if I want to fix it, I guess that means buy a new faucet).One last caveat here, is that the instructions are not clear at all, IMO, and quite frustrating (and this is not my first rodeo when it comes to installing plumbing fixtures, either).To end on a positive note, I was so disappointed with the &#34;action&#34; of the button out of the box, that I almost didn't install it.  It felt VERY mushy, and I was hoping that it was only due to it being dry, and that water pressure would make it perk up.  Happy to report that once water is flowing through, the button action is much more precise, and better with tactile feedback than it is when you just take it out of the box and click it on and off, dry.Appearance-wise, this faucet looks ok...for now, but I am quite unimpressed with the amount of plastic used here, and I have the feeling that I will be replacing this one, too, within a few years.  A plumber once told me that you really have to spend $400+ to get a decent kitchen faucet these days, that will last what people expect them to.  I have yet to do that, but getting tired of replacing these, so I guess a $500 that lasts 10 years is better than 3 faucets @ $250+ each during that same time."

3753891,B001UMZ07A,Made an old car look like new,"I bought this to use on my son's 1997 black Honda Accord. Although I've maintained the car well and it has no rust, there are enough small scratches on the hood from rocks over the years to mar the color.This product requires some work. You have to wash the card first, naturally. Then you apply the pre-finish, which you remove with the detailing spray. After this step alone the car looks 100% better.After the pre-finish, apply the wax. Be careful, it's a thin consistency and will spill and leave black stains on a light surface, such as a garage floor. Try and keep the car in the shade or work on it (carefully) in the garage. It's much easier to work on a cool surface. Also, just a word of caution, wear latex or vinyl gloves if you can to prevent the black wax and pre-finish from getting on your skin and under your nails.When the car was done it shined very nicely with a beautiful black sheen that masked a multitude of scratches. The 15-year old car looked just great.I can speak to durability yet and I'm tempted to put a coat of conventional clear wax on top of the black wax.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to enhance the look of their black car. Just know that it's a reasonable amount of work--but worth it!"

The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working.  It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews. I took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. I contacted M-Audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. One on the East coast and one on be west coast. I've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site. M-Audio doesn't stand behind their products, and I'll never purchase anything from them again."

1339298,B000083JTR,It's a good start,"I liked this game but the missions were just too hard. This is the beginning of the Splinter Cell series from gaming mastermind, Tom Clancy. This game dominated the ps2 world for quite some time now and the second series, Pandora Tommorow is even more better. But eventually this game will get boring. So if you liked Metal Gear Solid, this is the more better version of it and has great realistic graphics and excellent stealth mode gameplay. It's great, one of the best games to come on the ps2, and there will be more games of the same kind to come."
2054958,1404974571,A Mess,"What happens when you eat too much sugar? I get headaches and my teeth ache. Nicole Kidman's head must have pounded with migraines during the production of ""Bewitched"", the convoluted, overly plotted feature film version of the television show from the late 60s.Isabel (Kidman, ""The Others"", ""Moulin Rouge"") is a nave (emphasis on `nave'), young witch who decides to move to the San Fernando Valley. She intends to give up witchcraft, to live a normal life, to become a real woman, with real problems, who falls for a mess-of-a-man who needs her. In walks Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell), a famous actor who, in an act of desperation, signs to do a television reworking of ""Bewitched"". In this version, Darrin is the central character and Jack wants to find an unknown to play Samantha. One day, at Book Soup, he spots Isabel and pleads with her to become his television wife. She falls for him and walks around doe-eyed until she realizes that he is merely trying to regain his star status. Isabel decides to get even and witchcraft is the only way.Co-written and directed by Nora Ephron (""Lucky Numbers"", ""Sleepless in Seattle, ""You've Got Mail""), the film is, unfortunately, on a par with all of her other efforts as a director - she didn't direct ""Sleepless"". In all of Ephron's films, she comes up with an interesting idea, casts good actors and then everything derails into a huge mess.Apparently, the script for ""Bewitched"" has been in development for a decade. A decade! It shows. The finished film is so over developed it is almost incredible. They couldn't merely make a film version of the television show, with Kidman and Ferrell playing Samantha and Darrin, perhaps set in 2005, they had to make a film about actors in a new television version of the old television show. Worse yet, they have scenes of Kidman and Ferrell watching the old television show and then recreating the same scenes for the new show. Huh? What?Because Kidman and Ferrell play two completely different characters, seemingly from different worlds, it never appears convincing when they start to fall in love. Ferrell's character, Jack Wyatt, is a typical stereotype of a conceited actor who is full of himself. Nothing original or interesting is done with the character. In one scene, Isabel does a little magic and Jack begins to spout gibberish instead of the lines he is supposed to say. With each take, new gibberish. This is exactly the same thing that Steve Carrel did so brilliantly in ""Bruce Almighty"". Carrel is a buddy of Ferrell and appears in the film as Uncle Arthur. So, not only is Farrell doing nothing new, he is rehashing the work of his friends? Has it already come to this?Kidman's Isabel is too nave and too waifish to be interesting or believable. Her character has a softness to her voice, throughout the entire film, which makes her, oh, okay, unbearable. Kidman has made two comedies, in two years, both of which have been terrible. Remember last summers ""The Stepford Wives""? She later blamed the failure of that film on a script that wasn't ready. I wonder what or who will blamed for the failure of ""Bewitched""?The failure has to be blamed on Ephron. After we meet the characters, the director is so intent on manipulating the story, to get to the point when Ferrell will act funny, or Kidman will get to use a little magic, that nothing seems natural or organic. Ferrell is the more successful of the two, but again, he doesn't do anything original. In one scene he tells someone ""Make me 20 cappuccinos and bring me the best one"". It's funny, but we've seen it before. Everything about the story is forced and unconvincing.Then, for some reason, the story of Isabel's life starts to have parallels to Samantha's in ""Bewitched"". Both have an Aunt Clara (Carole Shelley) and Isabel's appears to be exactly like the one in the old television show. Huh? Why? It seems like they decided at some point to switch gears. We don't want to make a straight forward remake. Oh, wait. Yes, we do.The film has a great cast. But they are wasted.  Michael Caine plays Isabel's dad, Shirley McClaine plays a stage actress who is hired to play Endora, Steve Carrel plays Uncle Arthur. Jason Schwartzmann is Jack's agent. Of these, Schwartzmann is the most successful, perhaps because we expect the least from him. Michael Caine basically pops up in a bunch of different places, on a frozen food box, on a can of peas, walking out of a painted backdrop. The turn is amusing, but isn't as integral to the plot as it needed to be. MacLaine is wasted as Iris Smythson, a stage actress hired to play Endora. Her first appearance as Endora, as they are taping is funny. But then it seems as though her character was forgotten, as though they didn't know what to do with her.After Isabel gets the job on the television show, she forms a little clique with a PA from the show and her neighbor (Kristin Chenoweth). The three sit around and talk about revenge, putting hexes on people, etc. The idea becomes such a labored, mixed effort that it is amazing it wasn't cut out. Almost. Until you realize the rest of the film is as mixed an effort. Then it all makes perfect sense.Ephron is a skilled writer. But she apparently needs someone else to direct her material, to make it stronger, more consistent and more viable. To raise questions about scenes and characters that don't work. To make the material work. In ""Bewitched"", she doesn't have that."
340534,B001N4JYX6,This tastes nasty!,"I have low Vitamin D and was looking for something to raise my level quickly.  I read the positive reviews on this and thought I would give it a try.  Vitamin D capsules upset my belly and I was hoping I could tolerate the liquid better.  The first dose, I actually gagged!  The next dose I tried adding it to iced tea.  It didn't help, at all! I'm back to the capsules and chewing lots of anti-acids.  I wouldn't take another dose of this for a ten dollar bill!"
3604161,B0002H3ZI0,YUK,"I bought this because my dog pulls all the time and a trainer had suggested a nose type collar. My arm hurts all the time from her constant pulling and she has a few times almost made me fall. This collar would not fit her right with no amount of adjustment, it put pressure on her eyes. I don't know if my german shorthair's eyes are placed any differently than any other dog but the strap would not stay down on her nose at all. I do not want to do any damage to her so I returned the collar.Note--  I do not see how playing tug of war would make a dog walk on a leash properly. (a poster from above) I have tried using treats, voice commands, etc and nothing works to control her pulling."
152112,B00BQ7NLIE,Fits well and is good bang for the buck.,Fits well and offers a lot of protection for back and sides. Front screen will still need some sort of protection because this does not come with a screen protector.My last phone I did not have any sort of protection and it slipped off the dresser and landed flat on its back. The screen shattered. I decided at that point to get a protector for my new phone. I looked for an Otterbox solution but at the time there was none.Pros:+ Cheap+ Durable+ Easy to installCons:- No front screen protector includedOverall the con is very minor and I really enjoy this case.

3494776,B00AF6B22E,"Flight should be renamed to an AA story for a Pilot, it is about the flight of a person not a plane.","It seemed like a long AA advertisement. This movie is not really about a plane flight but about a person's flight from crashing in drugs to recovery, and it does not really go in depth with the character, just a lot of bad scenes showing abuse. So, not much of a story, the 1 star for DW bringing something to the show. I would not bother watching this. I guess I felt it was a disappointment because I was expecting a movie about a plane, pilot, and court drama and it does not."
1864045,B00009V7T2,Brilliant,"This album is not for those who like cute three minute pop songs, in fact it stretches music itself with guitar solos, bleeps, electronic drones, and whatever else the Mars Volta can throw in. It should be listened to as a whole as it shows it's brilliance with repeated listens.  Mars Volta combine Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Aphex Twin, and Yes all into one but maintain their unique sound. What more can be said about this that hasn't been said by the other reviewers, it is amazing music plain and complex. The vocals at times seem like an instrument themselves and the guitar work is as intricate as you can get.  Mars Volta are the good band that resulted from punk outfit At-The- Drive-In. Do yourself a favor and buy this ASAP."

9760,B0027FFZEW,Amazing... I'm so happy I tried it.,"I'm the type to research anything and everything before I buy, so of course I spent quite a bit of time reading and watching reviews of both the Voyager Pro and the Discovery 975. After much debate, I decided to go with the Pro, and I am so glad I did... It's amazing!I decided on the Pro, because I wanted a 'behind the ear' design for both optimal comfort and stability. Also, my research shows that the Pro has the upper hand when it came to straight audio performance. It excels in both areas. Here are some of my thoughts and impressions on different aspects of the device.First, the size and fit... Do NOT worry about the size of the device. It appears much larger and more intimidating in photos than it is in person. It's actually a very comfortable, manageable size. When it's on your ear, it doesn't seem out of place. It seems appropriate and looks quite nice and professional. The behind the ear design means that the device is VERY stable. Once it's in place, I can move freely about with no fear that it will fall out. I can swing my head around in all directions, and I never feel as though it's going to fall out.It's also VERY comfortable. I totally agree with other reviewers who say they forget that they're wearing it. Very easy to do. It is very light... Barely over half an ounce, it is barely noticeable at all. It is perfectly balanced, so it doesn't flop or pull in any direction. It feels solid and I completely forget that I have it on. I've worn it for several hours at a time at work, and don't even feel it. It has never made my ear sore, nor the inside of my ear. The ear bud fittings are completely comfortable.Second, the buttons and features... Do NOT worry about the placement of the on/off switch, as some reviewers have mentioned. It is on the rear of the ear piece, and once you get used to it, it is easy to find and press. The volume buttons are on top, and are very naturally placed and easy to use. And the answer button is on the outside of the ear bud, very commonly placed like many bluetooth devices... In my opinion, I would prefer the answer button to be on top, but that's my personal preference.You can answer a call with one short press, and hang up the call with one short press. You can also long press and use voice activation to make a call, if your phone offers that ability. Or, you can long press when a call comes in to automatically refuse the call and send it to voicemail. You can short press twice to automatically redial the last number.Once your on a call, you can mute the call and hear an audible confirmation say 'Mute On' or 'Mute Off'. You can also switch between the headset and the phone easily. And you can pair the headset with more than one device. The volume goes louder than most other headsets I've tried. That, plus the design of the ear bud, plus the superior sound quality means that volume should not be an issue for you. It is plenty loud enough for me.Also, the battery lasts a LONG time. 90 minutes will fully charge the battery, and you get 6 hours of talk time. I don't have any issues running out of battery. Plus, when it does get low, the device notifies you with a voice that says 'Battery Low' and 'Recharge Battery'Third, sound quality and performance... It's amazing, plain and simple. The call quality is truly second to none. I was very impressed once I heard it for myself. When I'm on the headset, people tell me they can't tell. They always say I sound great, and don't cut in or out. And the best part is the wind/noise cancellation abilities. When I'm in the car with wind/road noise, my voice still sounds clear to them. Plus, callers always sound great to me, despite the noise conditions where they're at. It simply out performs any other headsets I've tried. And for this price, it is a steal.At Best Buy the Voyager Pro will cost you 99.00, but I got mine from my local Fry's store for 69.00 and paid an additional 11.00 for a two year, in store, replacemente warranty if it ever breaks. So my 81.00 investment is still cheaper than B.B. So, you should definitely grab one at this price. I would easily pay 99.00 for one if I had to, no hesitations.If you're debating between the Voyager Pro and the Discovery 975, then my research shows that although the 975 is newer, and offers a few more features with voice commands, the Pro still has the superior audio performance. Also, the 975 is not a behind the ear design, so it is less stable than the Pro. Plus the 975 is 60.00 more than the Pro. So, just truse me and get this. The Plantronics Voyager Pro is the best bluetooth of all the high end ones that I or any of my friends has, or has had, hands down.Hope this was helpful...*** UPDATE: JAN 2011 ***My girlfriend just bought the Discovery 975 yesterday, and we spent a couple hours testing it against my Voyager Pro for sound quality. Hands down, the Voyager Pro is completely superior!The noise cancelling, and wind reduction is noticeably better on my Pro. We tested them standing in front of a fan and air conditioner... Both blocked all the noise when you're not talking, but the 975 had interference when talking in the wind. The Pro was far better.We also tested it near a faucet and running water. Same noticeable difference... The 975 was particularly noisy and hard to listen to when near running water. The Pro blocked it out nicely.Outside near heavy traffic, also the same. The Pro was hands down superior. Also with heavy breathing and yawning. We were both really disappointed. She was hoping the 975 would be great because she can't wear the Pro comfortably because of her ear. She is returning it today and sticking with her old one.So, it's true what the professional reviewers say about the Pro having superior sound quality. All my testing proves the same.Hope that helps..."
1711332,B0002TUWG6,"Old tech, with much better AA lights available-- read for links","At one time this flashlight was more competitive, but these days many flashlights are available at a similar price point (or lower) with much better specifications.This light is solidly built compared to older flashlights, but modern flashlight makers such as Fenix make even more durable lights out of aircraft-grade aluminum and other materials.  The build on this light is decent but not stellar by modern standards; it only for example offers water resistant construction (I believe the listing to be in error on this), while more modern competing lights offer 1PX8 complete waterproofing to two meters or more.  Competing lights also tend to offer more brightness levels/modes (which aids in runtime and preservation of night vision), better max brightness, optional ability to take higher-powered 14500 batteries, and other features.Some competing more modern 1 X AA lights in the same price band with better features include theOlight i2,ITP A2 EOS,Fenix E11,Fenix LD15,JETBeam BA10, and4Sevens Quark MiNi AA.  This list is not exhaustive, but hopefully browsing this selection will convince you that you can get far more for your money than with the Inova X1.  It's not bad; it's simply an older design with older tech, and not competitive today."

1869558,B00065XJ52,It Does Deserve An Encore,"I think it's nearly impossible for Eminem to release albums better than Marshall Mathers LP and Eminem Show, but I'm sure he has tried. The one thing I hate the most in Encore is that Eminem sings too much. He's not a singer, he's a rapper! Of course he raps in every track, but his ducky voice makes me sick when he sings. The first single, Just Lose It, is fine, the beats are real nice. Evil Deeds, the second track, is one of the best ones in the album along with Mosh. The funniest track is, by far, Ass Like That; and the best one is Mockingbird (sounds a little bit like Hailie's Song), I'm not sure if this is the best song Eminem has ever composed, since there are other very nice ones out there such as The Way I Am and Sing For The Moment, but it's top notch in rap quality. Marhall's Slim Shady alter ego almost didn't exist in Eminem Show, with the exeption of the track My Dad's Gone Crazy; and it's back in Encore. Most tracks have lots of humor and you'll probably laugh in many of them.Overall, while this isn't a masterpiece like Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show, fans will love it. It's not to be taken seriously like Eminem Show, so I think most critics won't like it that much. Hey, but who cares about them? Give this record a try, Eminem has already proven he's a talented rapper, either you want it or not, you know it."

I did have to cook the pasta over the 12 minute time it said it took to cook and it still was a bit hard, but it could be the type of noodles.

3746889,B000C9R1D8,The one I bought was DEFECTIVE,"I wound up spending $200 or more replacing my Vent Valve Solenoid, purge valve and Evap Canister because I was sold a defective AcDelco GT276 gas cap. I got the dreaded p0400 code and learned the first thing to check is the gas cap. Bought the Delco brand because of the tassle and hoped that it would be the same as the oem cap. Well, it's not!After replacing the gas cap and getting the same code a couple weeks later, I began to try and troubleshoot the EVAP system and quickly learned that it is a booger...After spending the time and money to replace the above mentioned parts and continuing to get the SES light and monitoring results thru my system/code reader, I turned my focus back to the Gas Cap. I had noticed that the tension on the cap before it began to click wasn't even as strong as the old oem cap I had replaced. At my wits end , I decided to go ahead and purchase the STANT brand gas cap and give it a shot. I read some good reviews about Stant. The new cap arrived and the tension and fit on it was 10 times better than this cap. After replacing with the Stant cap, I monitored the cars system and it PASSED the EVAP check. At that time I felt relieved that I found my problem, but I was also peeved that I had spent $200 on other parts because of this defective cap. So I would advise anybody out there to buy a Stant instead..... Oh, and the Delco is made in Germany"

With a HUGE span, you can dry off a car in 5 minutes, including all the nooks and crannies, and be on your merry way to cruise around in your freshly cleaned ride. ;)I personally would recommend people folding this towel so you have many sections to work with (and so it doesn't snag on anything!).  Start from the top and move your way down so that any excess water and be pushed down towards parts of the car you haven't dried rather than having water drip on where you JUST dried (now wouldn't that be annoying?)Good product!

1718740,B000ASG8A8,Dewalt DW718,"I hate to write a negative review about Dewalt power tools, because I own many of them and they have been good to me, but this will be my first. This Dewalt DW718 miter saw has way to much blade wobble. Using it for finish work as I do makes cuts very inaccurate. The motor in my opinion is a little underpowered. I was recently cutting through some 3/4 inch oak plywood for some cabinet finishing and as soon as I started cutting you could hear the motor drag down significantly. The bevel scale in the back of this saw is also hard to read for accurate measurements. Some good points of the saw is that it is somewhat light in weight, great slide range up to 16 inches, and a high fence for cutting some of those tall baseboards. I personally would steer clear of this saw and try the Bosch 5412L 12 inch slide which I have and works great, or the Makita 10 inch slide which is another great saw as well. For overall value, capacity, range, and ease of use I would highly recommend the Ridgid 12 inch slide miter saw. Eventhough it is a little on the heavy side and you have to go to Home Depot to purchase it, it is really an all around great miter saw."
1874986,B000J103X4,Don't Hate the Player,"New York Times ain't exactly the reference when it comes to Hip Hop, but the doctor's advocate is indeed one of if not the best hip hop album of 2006 so far. Everybody knows the boy can spit. Everybody knows he also loves the attention and doesn't shy away from beef. Regardless, whether or not you like his antics, you cannot listen to this album and not bump your head to it.The track selection is great, very good production, The game talks a lot about Dre ( even got a track dedicated to him ) and though the legendary producer is M.I.A, the whole album's got that West Coast vibe reminiscent of that good old G-Funk era.""Compton"", ""One Night"", ""California Vacation"" are instant bangers, and that last track with Nas is a classic. A lot of G-UNIT kids act like $.50 made The Game, if it is so then let $.50 make another one, and negro please, Spyda Loc is nowhere near The Game's caliber.The only thing I wasn't too hot about was Game's delivery.

Bottom line, they knew this would happen and didn't want to devote the resources to alleviate the situation. How bout having MORE than enough servers at launch to make your consumers happy? Not going to happen. Either reviewers are going to have to bring the metacritic scores down or we will have to boycott to stop the DRM madness."

Contains Soy.****************With that said, the first thing that sticks out is the blaring MSG & Sodium Nitrate!!They go to say how the beef is ""all natural"" (no hormones or antibiotics) but then they throw MSG & nitrates on it and ruin the whole thing with two of the worst ingredients on the market.It is in a convenient package that keeps the portion size down to the current trend of snacks you can throw in your backpack for around 100 calories.The beef is ""moist"" giving a sense of eating a piece of fresh meat vs. dehydrated (no moisture) beef. Makes me suspicious of what those other ingredients are that I can't pronounce.I did like the flavor. More spicy than sweet, that it may be a too much ""kick"" for some people.Since the time of writing this review there is no cost information, but comparing other Mr.Z jerky this is going to run about $20 for twelve 1oz bags (or 61cents per oz). Looking at other beef jerky brands on Amazon, it appears prices run between 60cents to 90cents per oz.OVERALL:- 1 oz. of jerky just doesn't seem like much of a snack. Better to get some trail mix if you need an ""energy"" snack- Some VERY unfavorable ingredients added here- Good flavor for me, since I like spicy- If you need a beef jerky product, this is probably priced on the lower end of the spectrum for the amount of ounces you'll get.But for about $70 you could buy your own dehydrator and cookbook. You'll soon make up the cost of three or four orders of this product and be able to control the quality of ingredients that go into your own jerky."

I was not sure the round shape was going to keep them busy for very long, but as it turned out, even without the toy that holds these treats?, it lasted at least an hour for my lab, and two for the little pup.  Was glad to get two in the package.  I might look into getting these with the toy that one can put them in, to make it a game for them in the future, and possibly make it even longer lasting.

1719071,B000B8I9EK,Sharp and tough,"I bought this set so that I would have some nice chisels on hand whenever I might need them. For some reason, I thought the chisels would be short and stubby.  They are not.  The handles are about 5 inches long.  The blades range in length from 4 1/2 to 5 inches. The steel shank goes all the way through the handle and is capped off with a flat steel cap.  When tapping on the end of the handles with a hammer (or the palm of your hand), you are not tapping on plastic. The energy is being transferred through the steel shaft directly to the head of the chisel. The ""Fat"" handles are substantial and extremely comfortable.  The blades were (are) very sharp...right out of the box. These chisels look and feel durable.  I'm sure they will provide years of service.  The set comes in a clear, hard, plastic case which will probably crack the first time you drop it.  The case is more for ""show"" than go.  I am very glad I bought this set of Stanley chisels."

Well, I'll probably give you a short summary 'bout this album for those who DO want to buy the album!

1878311,B001EOQTSI,Beautiful art rock?,"For all the things Tv on the Radio do right - and they do alot of things right... its easy to like them - I think 'Dear Science' fails.It doesnt retain the unique charm and immersion of the earlier efforts. The soundscape on Dear Science is one made of 'glitter and sparkle'. This is borderline pop, and as pop it doesnt have near enough catchy melodies. So ultimately it doesnt have much for me to come back to, time and time again.Somewhere along the line well respected media outlets like ""Pitchfork"" seem to have forgotten what it is that makes music worth the experience.Look, Im sure you can argue why this is an important album, but what happened to the value of the experience itself, because there is nothing here for me. Its short of fun, short of vision, short of attention, and short of immersion.In my opinion this is not the best album of the year. Not by far.It doesnt have songs near the intensity of 'wolf like me', ""I was a lover"", ""staring at the sun"", ""ambulance"". Those were catchy tracks which I would listen to over and over again and feel snobingly blissful knowing nothing else sounded like them. Beautiful art rock.But Dear Science is not beautiful and its not art rock.I think its time we re-examine our perspective and remind ourself why we listen to music."
400726,B003SW2QI6,Always the best deals,"I am an avid drinker of breakfast smoothies, as I am usually rushing out the door first thing in the morning. These blender bottles make them so much easier to mix and transport. They're very sturdy and don't hold smell or warp in my dishwasher as other mixing bottles have (despite our best efforts, my dishwasher seems determined to run at a bazillion degrees and has claimed many a plastic container). They also don't leak at all, which is awesome. I normally store them on their side in my lunch bag, so not having a mess is great.I normally use Plant Fusion vegan smoothie mixes (Chocolate raspberry is currently my favorite), a cup or so of frozen fruit, a handful of spinach and some water. I blend it all, and then dump it in - usually since I make my smoothies the night before, there is some separation when I grab them out of the fridge in the morning, but the container mixes it right back up for me.I'd definitely recommend these Blender Bottles to anyone. I've even used them in the past to mix up scrambled eggs, pancake batter, and more. They're indespensible, and I have to keep ordering more as folks steal them from me because they're so neat!"
1477025,B004I5EE46,Dance Central- Xbox,"I like the game but I have to say my expectations where too high. I'm not even sure what I was expecting but I can say that it was not what I got. Not that its a bad thing cause the game is still fun just thought it would be different.I do however like that it has different levels from easy, med, hard. Though you will not be able to go straight to hard on some of them (not sure about all) without having to master the easy then unlock the harder ones.The variety of music in my personal opinion sucked! I knew most of the songs and still wondered why the HECK would they even put them on there when there are CLEARLY better ones out there. So with that said I don't play the songs I don't care for, this would not seem so much of a problem but... a majority of them for me suck and there for I don't get the full experience. (This is my fault, I should have looked into the song choice BEFORE purchasing). But I would rather it be out there so you can look into this yourself.Another thing I had hated was that if you don't know the move and your trying to learn the steps the guy talking to you will tell you, you have 3 times to get it right and even when your going through some of the motions and get it right and sometimes when you don't, it will still drag on until you get it correct. Other times it will just give up on you and move on to the next move. Annoying much? YES! This defeats the purpose of learning it? How does it expect you to learn them?Then there is the the ""dance battle"" where you and someone can battle it out and see who wins. This is fun. But this is the only time that a second player can enter the game, and even so you have to switch and take turns so you can't actually do anything side by side.You can also rank up and earn gold stars in each level of songs. There is a feature for exercising too that you can turn on and see how of a work out your actually getting. This was a cool feature.This game would be easier to learn dance moves than say (Black Eyed Peas Experience)This one it lets you learn at a slower pace. Though the moves are more basic and you do have to hit this more spot on than (BEP Experience). So you have to keep that in hand when you purchase stuff like this since its all sort of a give and take, learn and go type thing. Basically its like this- If your a good dancer and are doing the moves flawless the sensor will not pick it up. If you go with the flow and are just more or less goofing off then it works better. This is only MY opinion though.There is so much more to this but I pointed out the things that I wanted to say. I do NOT regret purchasing the game. Me and my family can laugh at each other attempting to dance and get a very mini work out too."

3754465,B00265M9SS,Nice concept...if it worked,"If this kit was of better quality it would be a nice way for one person to bleed brakes. However, this kit is sorely lacking in the quality dept. First, the plastic hose is packed in the box with kinks in it. So even after trying to relax the kinks, they collapse with suction is applied. The adapters are a 'one time' application. Once I seated the adapter to the first brake bleeder valve (which worked well), it was all over... The following bleeder valves wouldn't seat, as the adapter was not pliable enough to re-seat. Do yourself a favor and buy a set of speed bleeders...and leave this kit alone!"

3760376,B008FV5R0Y,So it finally snowed,"I waited for actual snow before writing this review, it's snowed about 3 inches so I unpackaged this unit donned my gloves and hat and set forth to clear my car. There are two clips on the unit where the handle is stored, unclipped the handle and adjusted for size. ( I have a small SUV) First setback was the units handle locking and unlocking system is tight and secure, really really tight and secure! After some grunting and twisting I got the thing set up. When tight, unlike the photo the scraper is at a 90 degree angle to the snow pusher ( more on this later). The foam snow pusher actually did a good job and cleared snow cleanly with no marring, it seemed to hold up to the usual edges and bumps from wipers, antennas, etc. and the length made the job quick.After snow removal I used the scraper end to get the light coat of ice off the windows. Because the foam pusher end is at 90 degrees to the scraper you end up trying to manage scraping with a wet 18 inch or so pusher end oriented up and down dripping icy water on you while trying to scrape horizontally. Trying to unlock the handle for storage with wet cold gloves was an exercise in frustration I managed it by sitting in my car for some leverage. Now I'm no weakling but I can't imagine a slightly built person or a lessor grip actually adjusting this thing on a cold dark wet icy morning with cold wet fingers. I was soaked by the time I was done.Overall, a good idea, but poor execution."
461810,B006TEWMZM,Uncomfortable and expensive.,"I developed carpal tunnel issues about 2 years ago due to working as a production baker (~200 baguettes a day!). I&#8217;ve had a chance to try our several different wrist braces, both for day and night use. I&#8217;ve found that wearing a stiff brace (i.e. with a splint) at night makes a huge difference &#8211; it&#8217;s more effective than acupuncture and meds for me.I tried this wrist brace combo for about a week, and honestly, I&#8217;m not very happy with it. Despite its high price, it doesn&#8217;t really work better than some of the other wrist braces I&#8217;ve tried. I find it tricky to put on, especially with the right amount of tension &#8211; the straps are not designed for optimal ease of use. The seams/stiches are rough and get pretty annoying. The thumb insert area is especially bothersome because it gouges into that soft part between the thumb and forefinger. Using both part of the day/night system also makes this thing way too bulky for me. The outer sleeve, which I think is supposed to make the brace look nicer during day use doesn&#8217;t do much to actually do that. Even though the brace immobilizes my wrist at night, I really can&#8217;t wear it because it is uncomfortable due to the issues mentioned above.Instead, I&#8217;ve gone back to my old separate day and night braces. For day, I like the Ace brace with the removable splint. It&#8217;s pretty slim and the splint makes it effective. It can be removed if I don&#8217;t need that extra support (or need more mobility) during the day. I&#8217;m actually wearing it as I type this. For night, I find the OTC Lightweight Breathable Wrist to be pretty perfect &#8211; it&#8217;s comfortable and effective (I definitely notice the improvement in my symptoms every morning), and 1/3 the price of the Palo brace."

23659,B003YWFAYC,Not up to BodyGlove standards,"This case was the first BodyGlove product that I have been dissatisfied with since I bought my first BodyGlove product back in 1998. Previous to this, it has been a requirement for me that a new phone should have a BodyGlove case available for it if I were to buy it.I could not get the case to snap shut on the phone. It was not obvious to me how to do it, and there were no instructions included. The construction of the case was not as sturdy as other BodyGlove cases that I have used. The plastic was flimsy compared to the stitched leather that I was used to. I did not have confidence that it could protect a $500 phone from drops. There is no padding inside the case. BodyGlove may be irrelevant in the smartphone generation. The construction techniques that worked with soap-bar phones with small screens just don't apply to a phone that is all screen.I bought a rubber skin for my phone and a horizontal pouch case. This provides the kind of protection that I was looking for. BodyGlove was good to me while it lasted. I'm sorry to see it end."

3620049,B0009ZBKGE,Love this Harness.,"This harness is great! The harness alone does not make my dog walk nicely but coupled with training my 9month old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel went from practically tearing up the ground and hurting my arm to walking like a pro!! We switched to this harness from a mesh harness and I was worried that this one would be uncomfortable for him but he seems just as comfortable in it as the other one if not more so. It is not bulky (so its great for the hot summer) and extremely easy to put on once you figure it out compared to other harnesses I have used. Also, this harness unlike some others does not seem to put any pressure on the neck in either the front or back.About the sizing: I have a 17 pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who is 9 months old and the tweener small/medium size is slightly big on him. When I tighten the harness to the tightest it will go it fits pretty good but still ever so slightly loose so if you have a dog around this size I would recommend getting a small.What helped our seemingly helpless leash-pulling dog walk like a pro:1. Stand up straight with good posture (this posture shows that you are leader - dogs react to body language)2. Walk and think confidently. While strong and confident, also remain relaxed, patient, and in good spirits (dogs are good at picking up on our emotional state.3. Hold the leash short but loose with a relaxed arm and shoulder.4. Make sure your dog is either at your side or behind you when walking and if he is pulling don't give in, only allowing him to be at your side until he gets the picture.5. Don't let him stop and sniff or go to the bathroom on his own terms - being able to do so is a reward and should only be done when told to by you.6. The walk should be much longer than the time that he gets to sniff around to show that you are the leader.7. Have your dog sit/wait upon opening the door and walking outside, allowing you to exit the house first and likewise have your dog sit/wait before entering the house, allowing you to be the first one in the house showing that you are the leader.8. Always bring treats with you on walks that you can easily stick in your pocket and use for rewarding for good behavior. Along with treats, praise and encourage your dog verbally and/or petting when they are doing what you want them to do! The first few times they walk nicely - reward them immediately. But as they start walking the way you want on a regular basis, treats can become more infrequent and eventually only one treat when they get back from the walk. You can also use treats on walks in other situations such as when they see a person or and don't bark, sit/stay still when you are picking up their poop, etc.9. Don't give up! How quickly and effectively get results may surprise you! If they are used to leading and pulling it may take some time but I promise that working on it for a few days to a few weeks to get them under control is definitely worth the time and effort. Our dog seemed to be completely hopeless after trying all kinds of methods we tried on our own and with limited research but after I did more research and followed these tips, he now walks like a ""normal"" well-behaved dog!10. Once you get the walk down (it will take practice and consistency), they will start to view you as the leader and trust you more which may even help with other issues like anxiety, barking, etc.10. If you have been consistent in trying these steps or others and your dog still pulls on the leash while walking - in my opinion it would be worth either taking your dog to some training classes offered in your area or hiring a trainer to come to your house as walks should be pleasant for both you and your dog, not stressful. And it doesn't get better on its own without intervention of some kind whether from you and whoever else takes care of the dog or a trainer. A few weeks of training will be worth years of peaceful walking."

The graphics are so-so and a bit hard for me to see what was going on. The enemies were very difficult to see and sometimes seemed to come out of nowhere, even places I had already cleared. The story is hard follow and really makes little sense. The actions of the AI squad are sporadic and they sometimes get stuck in certain places. There is a large variety of weapons, most of which you have to unlock by scoring points during the level or picking them up from dead enemies. I could not figure out how to use the weapon upgrade system. I played this game on the &#34;Normal&#34; level and it was still quite difficult. I did see several bugs throughout the game but I never experienced any lock ups. The first time I played I had to download some upgrades and install a 2 GB portion of the game to the hard drive. Not a big deal, really, but annoying for a high profile game like this. One would think all the bugs would have been worked out before release. I agree with other viewers that this game was released before it was ready. On the plus side the audio was great.On a personal note I find the trend of these games to emphasize the multiplayer and pretty much provide a token attempt at a single player campaign is very discouraging. If they want to release a multiplayer only game then just say so and we single players will buy something else. No problem."

My girlfriend loves the shape we had a similar toy but its kinda hard and fits a little too tight on the the wand. We were lucky that the chemical smell was not to strong because this toy is made with ""PVC"" which cannot be cleaned and is a BAD material for you! We have now thrown this toy out and are searching for one made with better material like silicone."

1835100,B000002INP,"First side bad, second side OK","This was originally released as a CD and LP in 1985.  It is 40 minutes long.  There is a new remastered version, with extra tracks and bonus CD that is a Bruford infomercial.On the original LP, the two sides were completely different.  Side A was a waste, and Side B was OK.  It is all piano and drum music.The music on side A is peppy little ditties.  Some of it sounds like circus music, other parts like what would be in a rodeo or for a Western movie.  It's all just a bunch of silly inconsequential bits.  Maybe something you would hear at a childrens concert.Things are better on the second side.  There are some nice little drum solos from Bruford and piano solos from Moraz.  Then there some very good discordant piano/drum duets.I bought the new remastered version of this CD based on the rave reviews given on Amazon.  I am not too happy about it.Be warned, that most of the CD is not what you would expect from Moraz, and mostly not like what Bruford has done before."

2595998,B00006AL1D,Make sure you get the CORRECT version!!!,"If you are going to buy the Back to the Future DVD at a store near you instead, BE AWARE!!!!Do ***NOT*** buy the one with the plastic wrapper with a sticker: 'First Time On DVD' - Universal made a huge mistake on the widescreen framing for Disc 2 and 3 on the first DVD Trilogy release, so you get cheated a lot more image compared to the original footage. And yet, these flawed copies are still on the market! An average customer would probably not notice or care, but if you are a true collector or a fan of this movie (who isn't?!) then what good is it to own a DVD with an error?But this has all been corrected on the NEW VERSION... now, how can you tell if it is the new version or not? Well...The DVD cover is exactly the same as the flawed first release; therefore... MAKE SURE you buy the one with an orange sticker on the plastic wrapper that says 'ALL 3 MOVIES - LOWEST PRICE EVER - OWN IT BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT' and made by Mexico; this version is the corrected version!If you want to make sure even further:At the bottom of Disc 2, it should have a 'V2' after All Rights Reserved.For Disc 3, it does ***NOT*** say V2 on the disc. However, if you insert the disc on your DVD drive (on the computer), and then check 'Date Modified', it should be the year 2003! (This goes for Disc 2 as well)There was never a problem with Disc 1 so it's fine being 2002 for 'Date Modified'.Whew... now we can all enjoy this classic movie like it should've been!Personally, Back to the Future 1 & 2 are my favorites; the future world is fun and exciting to look at (Although let's face it, we're not going to be driving flying cars in the year 2010! Only 5 years away...) As for the 3rd one... well, I'm not much into Western setting movies... but still a decent trilogy ending.This is a movie which ALL movie collectors MUST own."

3646126,B000Y91MZE,Does Not Last,"BoughtRanch Rewards Rawhide Retriever Dog Roll, Beef, 9-10-Inch, 13-Packbefore buying this item and I should have known better. Those regular rawhides lasted about half hour each! They also had some quality issues that I won't get into (I don't recommend them). Now the problem: I gave these 8"" compressed rawhides to my dog, expecting that ""Premium pressed rawhide bones lasts up to five times longer than regular rawhide"". It's right there in the product description. Well guess what: There wasn't a trace of this bone within 45 minutes. My daughter gave him another and sure enough, that was done within 45 minutes as well. They had to have tested this on a chihuahua and nothing bigger. Considering I spent nearly thirty bucks on a bag of 13, and one bone lasts 45 minutes, that is an AWFUL deal.For the record, I do have a large malamute. He is not a heavy chewer, though. One knotted 8"" regular rawhide (American Rawhide Brand) I bought from Walmart lasts him 3 days, including 2 nights in his kennel.Don't bother with this brand unless you have a tiny dog. It's like flushing money down the toilet. I am thankful Amazon is willing to give me a refund."

2958293,B000PKG8SS,ONLY HAPPY WHEN IT RAINS,"THE HOST has one thing going for it, an agile, almost logical, monster... and that's it.When it's on screen, when it's moving, when it's putting the bite on people or snatching the same people up and storing them in its own version of a CRISPER drawer, there is a lot to admire in this import.  The monster's first full on screen appearence is a marvel to behold, not only because it takes place during daylight hours (very rare for these types of films), not only because it takes place within a large crowd of people, but everyone and everything involved moves in a logical fashion.  From the frist sighting to final snatch and splash, it all looks like something that could very well happen.  Wonderfully done.As for the rest... get a pen, get a pad of paper and be prepared to take notes because little next to nothing makes any kind of sense.  The central players in THE HOST is a family seemingly put together from a series of other unproduced films.  There's the father who looks like a grandfather, two sons - one, a pudgy, bulky, slow witted father himself, the other a miracle of the Korean education and political system.  He's a lawyer in training, a corporate raider, a student, a eco/bio protester who's sister just happens to be a Olympic level athelete in the field of archery (taking the Bronze at the beginning of the film).  It's almost like a skewed version of the FANTASTIC FOUR, everyone seems to have some kind odd ""gift"" that sets them apart from the rest.There is also the daughter of the pudgy, bulky slow witted father who seemes to have gotten all her looks and good sense from her mother - which, for a film like this is a good thing.  It's her smarts that help her to survive and a mother's strength that allows her to make the ultimate sacrifice.  There's an unhappy ending here in THE HOST, but you'll have a hard time either understanding it, or feeling bad about it, because the rest of the film is mired in protest... against the government, against corporations, against posions, against any and everything it can lay its hands on.THE HOST is one busy film.  Actually, it's more like six films running at once and that's its main flaw, it doesn't know what it wants to say and instead of putting its focus squarely on a family in peril and a monster on the loose, it tries too hard to sum up Korea's political, social and corporate strife.  It's just too much of everything... and because of that THE HOST will go down as a missed oppurtunity to redefine the genre.  But, for the short time the monster is the star of the picture, it works... but not enough to earn a place on your shelf."

1488589,B0050SY06W,Mass Disappointment,"**INCLUDES SPOILERS**When the original Mass Effect came out for the Xbox 360, I fell in love with it!Yes, the graphics were not ""smooth"" and the concept of shooter-RPG was new at the time. However, I fell in love with character developments. I loved the fact that most of the Non-Playable Characters (NPC's) that I talked to had a story; and they didn't just have a bland story, their stories were deep and very interesting. These stories would vary on your choices; so, naturally, I played the game three times...thats right, THREE times just to see how the game would change with different choices. I loved the original Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 2 was even better. Mass Effect 2 added even more depth to the story. I could care less about Shepard, it was all about the choices that I made in original Mass Effect that mattered more. I spent more time with Mass Effect 2 than any other game since 2006.I am not going to discuss the graphics, the sound, or even the ""special edition stuff"". I want to review about what Mass Effect series has been about (for me anyways): the story with character development.A good story is good from the beginning to the end. You develop your Mass Effect story with the original ME, continue with ME2, and then you have ME3...which is suppose to be the end of your story. In ME3, Earth and many other planets are under attack, and Shepard is given the task of  building alliances with other races to take down the reapers for good. As you travel the galaxy to build alliance, ME3 does a fantastic job of implementing your decisions made in ME/ME2 with that of ME3...and believe me, your decisions in ME/ME2 does have an impact in ME3!ME3 DID everything brilliantly, except the end. You created a story which lasts across three games, but the end is like...well, lets just say your story/choices/decisions simply didn't matter at all. You make ""good"" or ""renegade"" decisions, or build all those relationships with your teammates hoping for a respective closure, but you are treated with one generic ending.Personally, with a series like Mass Effect (deep story/character building), I would have been happy with a few sentences saying what happens 10-years after your big fight or what happens to your squad...but nope, nothing like that. There are three endings...actually, its just one ending with three different colors.I have spent countless hours with the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2...making different decisions, making sure I get the best rating, making sure everyone is happy. They were absolutely fantastic games!Can the same be said for Mass Effect 3? No. I dont think I will even play it again. You can tell that EA and Bioware rushed through the game (most of my ME2 characters were killed in ME3) so they can focus on DLC's. Keep your olive branches EA/Bioware, if I want to play ME3 DLC's, I may consider buying a used copy of Mass Effect 3 ""Game of the Year Edition"" when its $10 on Ebay."
1565110,B000M7QSC0,amazing taste,"Such fresh, fruity flavors, with a nice tartness so they don't become cloying.  Really delish with true fruit taste.  Some of the best hard candies I've ever had!"
1550478,B000EVQWKC,warning labels .. are sadly missing...,I am very disappointed in the lack of concern for the customers of this product. There should be clear warnings re how this might affect many people re GI upset and gas etc..The taste isn't bad but I would think they could have made this product with less  sugar alcohol and thus reduce the side effect considerably.I will not be re-ordering this product..other that stating it is sugar free..it is NOT low Calorie at all.Serving size: 17 pieces (41g)Amount per serving:Calories:  160 ...... might as well get the Full sugar version and NOT have the side effects...Sorry..very very disappointed in this product
1666606,B0089VNRV6,much better than I expected,"I'll be honest, I normally hate the taste of coffee.  I got this in a subscription box, though, so I tried it.  I've managed to almost finish the entire 11 oz. container.  I think the vanilla flavoring in it moderates the coffee taste.  It's actually a pretty pleasant combination.  (This review is for the cappuccino flavor.)This is relatively thick although it still flows freely (it's definitely a shake, not a smoothie).  It's vegan (contains soy milk) and has some thickeners like xanthan gum.  It contains four sweeteners (rice syrup solids, cane syrup, inulin, and stevia) but the sugar level is actually fairly low, considering that (6g of sugars which are going to be almost exclusively from the rice syrup solids and the cane syrup).  I don't normally drink sugary things, and I don't often like sugary drinks, but I thought it worked here.  The sugar mix is low glycemic, too, and the whole product is organic and gluten-free.This is very high in protein and in fiber and is supplemented with vitamins and minerals, including some like B12 and zinc that can be hard to get in a vegan or vegetarian diet.  At 180 calories, with all that protein and fiber, this would probably make a decent on-the-go breakfast, maybe with a piece of fruit.I drank this at the end of a long day where I was completely exhausted from not enough sleep and lots of physical activity.  I think I actually feel a little bit restored, which is great.  In the future, I'd probably go for the chocolate flavor, but if you're a coffee fan, you'll probably like the cappuccino flavor even more than I do."
3754380,B0024E6ZRW,PICTURE IS MISLEADING - YOU ONLY GET ONE,"Talk about a let-down and a rip off!!!  I paid almost $15, for what I thought would be two units (as the product picture shows), only to take delivery of the component and find that you only get ONE OF THEM.Seriously. I could have bought a $17 pair of black jack-stands at big-box-car-parts, and done the same thing. I most assuredly would not have spent the equivalent of $30 for what would be a pair of screw jack stands!Save your money, and consider another solution.  They are solid, they are ok, they are nothing but screw-head jack stands...and there's no 'THEY' to it, you are buying one unit.*** ADDED DETAIL ***After trying to use this a couple of times, I also have to mention that the lower footer is about 3 x 3-inches, and the upper head of the jack also has a head of about 3 x 3 inches...this doesn't work really well with some steps...like mine. My steps are steel with a reinforcing ridge in the middle, running laterally across the bottom of the step. As a result, you can't 'nest' the head beneath your step treadplate, it only precariously sits on the edge of the step. As a result, there's not a lot of 'bracing' from using this at all. Yes, I could put a piece of pine shelving beneath the step and screw the jack into it (not good, if you don't want your steps to rust apart)...but you can't take that upper plate off, and the screw head is not removable...so in the end, this is the oddest white-elephant I've ever bought...can't get it to work whatsoever.I've got a pair of aluminium spinner jacks for loads up to 1000 pounds that work MUCH better than this thing...unfortunately, I can't even use it to stabilize the rear of the rv...there is only one of them...and it isn't rated anywhere near high enough to do something like that with..."

3252708,B003UPPNYA,THE WAIT IS OVER!,"This review is from: Live Voodoo [Blu-ray] [2010] [US Import] (Blu-ray)It's taken a long time for Jane's Addiction to finally release an official live blu ray/dvd, and while we might have preferred something from 1990/91 when the band were on top of their game at least we get the original line up performing as opposed to the 97 reunion which had Flea on bass or the 2003 line up which had Chris Chaney on bass. Eric Avery(Who has since left the band again to be replaced by Duff McKagan) reunited with the band when they got back together in 2008 and they were much better live for it, those of us lucky enough to see the original Jane's line up on tour last year would no doubt agree!So its the Voodoo Experience Festival, New Orleans, Halloween 2009 and the original Jane's line up are about to deliver a brilliant performance which see's them draw from their legendary studio albums 1988's Nothing Shocking and 1990's Ritual de lo Habitual as well as their self titled live debut release(2003's Strays has no material played from it mainly because Eric Avery did not appear on that album).The band open up with instrumental Up The Beach before we hear Avery's familiar bass line as Mountain Song comes crashing out of the speakers. Without doubt some of Jane's best moments are in their longer songs such as 11 minute classic Three Days which has Dave Navarro playing one of the best guitar solo's ever as Perry Farrell dances with 2 scantily clad dancers(one of which is his wife Etty Lau) it's a song that could last 30 minutes and you'd still want to hear it again straight afterwards. On Then She Did Perry asks the crowd to celebrate death, the song still sounds as good as ever with all it's twist and turns, Been Caught Stealing really gets the crowd fired up, and just before the band begin Ocean Size Perry Takes a moment to reflect on the damage that hurricane katrina did to the city of New Orleans. Ted, Just Admit It is one of the highlights of the night as it reaches it's dramatic climax. For the encore Jane's play Jane Says and are joined on stage by loads of people in fancy dress, they then finish the night off with the Drum and Percussion heavy Chip Away.The blu ray/dvd contains a small selection of extras the best being the two bonus tracks(1% and Ocean size) recorded in small clubs in 2008, as well as an NME featurette, the only draw backs about this release is that sometimes Perry's vocals seem a bit buried in the overall mix, but since official live Jane's footage is fairly thin on the ground this release is a must for Jane's fans!"

So I bought these, and they helped! He's worn them about half a dozen times now around the house for 1-5 hours at a time, and we're still on his first pair. I have to wait until he's lying down to put them on because you really have to stretch out the opening to slip them over his feet, but it works (like other reviewers have said, they're basically balloons). The first few times he tried to shake or pull them off, but now he tolerates them just fine, plop-plop-plopping around the house sounding like an idiot, but without slipping and sliding haha. I have to be careful to pull them up just below his dewclaws, but no other issues otherwise. The large size fits my greyhound perfectly. I would definitely recommend these!"

I've been out in pouring rain and at the pool getting splashed and so far it's stayed dry inside. No dust or odd watermarks have appeared inside. It fits my iPhone snugly and so far has done a great job protecting it from drops and falls onto cement. I can see tiny scratches on the corner plastic from these falls but the iPhone is completely unharmed.The clips on the side that attache the top and bottom are metal. At first I wasn't sure I liked how they looked but now I think it adds to the appearance of being safe and secure. The blue flexible tabs on the bottom are easy to pull out when you plug in your charger or wired headset. After daily use for months they still fit snugly in place.

1757616,B001DVW0PI,Reduced Water Flow!

Installation was fast and easy but the water flow has been reduced by at least 30 percent and the filter is brand new. Once it has done some filtering I am betting it slows even further. If I can buy a separate ""filter"" faucet and connect it to this unit I will keep it. By the way, a separate faucet will mean not only buying the faucet but cutting through a quartz counter requiring a diamond drill bit.I am just waiting for my wife to complain which could come at anytime.Very disappointing 3M!Update: Unit returned."

In fact, it slowly veers away from the formula, it's alot harder sounding than Trash and touches down on many more topics than Trash(which was basically Alice's sex concept album). It's on a more serious and darker note though.  There isn't much humor to be found. This one gets a decent amount of time in the cd player, it really does have some great tunes on it.  After you listen to it a few times, it will really sink in."

I didn't add the seasoning because the venison sausage has tons of spice to it.We all dug in. We all loved it. When I told him that it was from Velveeta, his response was ""I thought the cheese tasted different.""

524486,B00FFB07FC,Brush works so far.  No customer support.,"This brush seems like a pretty good deal.  It is a little bit more powerful that my Sonicare, and the brushes cost less.  I actually like the brushes.  Another reviewer commented on them being thinner and I was worried but they are good quality and my teeth feel nice and clean.  I don't like that it shuts off and turns on every 30 seconds, but I'm going to have to live with that, since there is no customer support number and the email they give you is undeliverable.  There will be no warranty as stated by the seller, since there is no way to get a hold of the company.  So, I got a sonic toothbrush for $49.  When it dies, it dies.  Hopefully it will either die within my 30 day return window, or last a year or two.There is a screw on the bottom of the handle so it looks like you can replace the battery maybe.  That's a good thing that Sonicare doesn't offer."

1882988,B00689J5PI,"Not a Summer Blockbuster, but good form","The song itself is a bit ""drive on the coatails"" of ""We Found Love"". A definite club song, well engineered for FM, it's classic Rihanna in this stage of her career stating with Only Girl In The World. If nobody has noticed, radio is now more driven by the beats and Dance Hall/House/ Trance influences now, vs the heavy Hip Hop/Rap that was a few years early. The european influence has finally moved into our top 40 frame of mind with a vengence. (take her work with David Guetta, Jump Smokers, etc).This is moving fast on the dance charts.This will not be the blockbuster of lets say ""We Found Love"", but is a good 10 5 single. As many have stated, she may no be getting a bit overexposed, but it does not diminish her talents of the strength of her music. This is a good single, well worth listening to, and will be on many a DJ's list, But for the future, it's time to seek out other styles as well, maybe a few back to her Barbados routes, or more unique duets, (no more Chris Browns please). Also we have not really scenne a definitive ballad from her yet,.This young lady is sooo talented...her management needs to look at her next 5 years more rather then the quick cash in. Her talent is just to damn good.UPDATES..now the single is of the ""past"" and the predictions were correct. While very popular. it did not achieve #1 (Billboard charts), and was a club favorite, especially the remixes. Her next album and singles as I hoped changed styles, the first a bit more mainstream ( Diamonds) , then R&B; and raw (Rude Boy type)(Pour it Up), and now a top 5 excellent ballad, As usual with reviews of superstars, it you dare to not say "" excellent"" or ""love her"" you get negatives.  I do have all her releases, Club mixes included, and will continue to buy them. She is the type of artist that you can buy unheard, she is that good."

It's just bad gimmick torture porn type stuff that's partly in German language, not real logical story but it's to be expected with such nastiness.

1822568,B0000009UW,For Completists Only,"I love country music -- the real stuff -- the kind Elvis attempts here. I also love Elvis Costello; for the past week, I have listened incessantly to his collaboration with Burt Bacharach, ""Painted From Memory.""*So with that as a perspective, I have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire Elvis catalog. Getting Billy Sherrill in Nashville surely was the right thing to do, but these songs don't click, and about none of these covers can stand along side the original. I can't specifically carp about the playing or the vocals, but where they fail is in capturing the heart, the spirit, the feel of country music. They sound too much like an experiment. Years later, Van Morrison, another giant, would fail in a similar effort.*For sure, this is not a ""bad"" album, but there are 20 better collections that Elvis has recorded and thousands of better country albums."
1870631,B000819PKC,This Will Be My Last Jamiroquai Purchase,"I can no longer support a group that won't make the effort in expanding and trying different things. Unlike the original incarnation of Jamiroquai...long gone are the days of the crew who were more than just an eclectic group of musicians and imaginative, natural born talents. Now, Jamiroquai has become just another group in passing, painstakingly trying to recapture it's gloys days of the early 90's.Yet, Dynamite isn't a total disaster. It's highlights include Seven Days In Sunny June, Feels Just Like It Should and Talullah.However, it's difficult to ignore it's bad points. The songwriting is probably the worst i've heard since j.lo's 'rebirth' album, which i find to be very surprising since jay has always been an excellent writer.Then there's the music. I have grown sick and tired of their crappy and overly repetative disco/techno hybird sound. It was a neat vibe they jumped off with on synchonized, but then... they took it past it's expiration date on 'A Funk Odyssey' and, then... semi-reheated it on this album.It's almost as if Jamiroquai isn't quite sure where to take it's direction in music anymore... whereas, it was instantanious in it's early years when ingenuity and imagination allowed jamiroquai to become the litmus test in modern day music.The hunger is no longer there. The passion is no longer there. They jumped the shark, became rock stars and Jamiroquai has clearly run it's course. And although I'm done supporting them, the memories of thier great catalog of music still remains golden."

1302224,B0042F1L4S,"this amp is oooookay , fizzle/crackle, and noise when you aren't playing","My review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great. Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things. Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did. I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't. This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like ""what music snobs"" and what have you. But I realized that I'm a music snob! I love the music I listen to more than anything, and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well. So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need. I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying ""throw away your pedals, you won't need them"" and ""I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now"", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it."
1439330,B002I098JE,"FIX THE SPAWNS, FIX THE MODDED CONTROLLERS, & FIX THE SNIPING","If I were to rate this on the first day of playing, I would have given it approximately 3-4 stars.  After playing it for approximately a month, I would rate this a 4-5 stars if not for three things -- the spawns, modded controllers (cheaters), and ""quick scoping"".SpawnsIt seems as though they took the awful spawns of black ops 2 and made them worse.  I didn't think it could get any worse, but it has.  The game is nearly unplayable as you could be having a great match, going 10-0, and find yourself getting spawn killed 4-5 times after a single death.  One would think, larger maps would equal less spawn deaths, but it is completely the opposite.  Large portions of the maps aren't even used and they will spawn you directly in the middle of a firefight when there is absolutely no one in certain areas.  I usually maintain a high K/D in most COD's, however, repeatedly find myself dying multiple times because I am spawned directly in front of people.Modded ControllersThis is the biggest issue that has not been addressed in any CODs.  I do not understand why they would introduce ANY single fire weapon into a game if they do not balance it when a modded controller is used.  All they have to do is make a single fire gun that does not fire during gameplay when used with a modded controller. If the gun/player is repeatedly out of an acceptable fire rate, then make the gun not fire at all.  The CHEATER would stop using mods because their player would not be shooting (thus dying all the time).  Instead, all CODs to date have allowed for the implementation of modded controllers.  Furthermore, there has been some controllers that go beyond rapid fire, such as auto aim, that make this game even more frustrating.  Activision has never really cared about a ""fair environment"" anyways or else they would police this.Quick ScopingLet me start by saying that I enjoy sniping on certain maps.  What I don't enjoy is being sniped from 3 feet away by a guy using a sniper rifle from short range...  The closer up a sniper rifle, the less accurate it should be.  Most CODS have allowed for quickscoping to some degree, but with Ghosts -- it is outright ridiculous.  In previous CODS, I would not complain about it because it took at least some degree of skill to do it.  With Ghosts, every kid can instantly draw up a sniper rifle from across the map or couple feet away accurately kill you at an instant.  It is by far the worst of the CODS involving quickscoping.Scenario with All ThreeJust yesterday, I was playing a TDM game in Stonehaven (the castle map) and had a series involving all three of these issues listed above.  I was shooting a player near the ""burning sniper house"" who was standing on the ground next to the building.  That player instantly draws up a sniper rifle and drops me when we were a few feet apart from one another.  I then spawned at the complete opposite end of the map (behind the castle) and was quickscoped by the same guy from next to the burning sniper house.  I watched the kill cam.  It shows the guy shooting me from point blank with a sniper rifle, then he runs about 2 feet forward, draws up his sniper rifle, and instantly headshots me.  We went on to play about 4-5 more matches with this kid and became aware, through his words, and gameplay that he was clearly using an aiming mod.Overall, I believe the game is being produced so that everyone has 1.0 - 1.5 K/Ds.  From a marketing standpoint, it makes more people want to play the game because everyone is equally as good.  More players = More Money.  Plain and simple.  When a kid picks up the game, he is not going to want to play it very long if he is not good at it.  However, these implementations are really about making the game less skill oriented and more luck oriented.  The spawn system and current kill streak systems are prime examples of this.  It's realistically about making more money -- selling more games.Trending Downward (Strictly on Multiplayer)MW2 = 5 starsBLOPS 1 = 5 starsMW3 = 5 starsBLOPS 2 = 1 starGhosts = 1-2 stars**Update 11/24/2013  Approximately two days have passed since the latest version/update.  There was a change to the ""Spawn Logic"" which has drastically improved the spawns.  They are not perfect, but they are not nearly as awful as they were during the first month of the game.  Interestingly, there was also an improvement to ""fix cheaters"", however, it is unclear what effect this has had on the game.  If they are actively banning modded controllers this would be a great step in the right direction, however, I doubt that is the case.  I have seen a modded single fire weapon today.  Nevertheless, the update has improved the game significantly.  Sniping is still a joke as anyone can do it at any rage with little skill necessary.  I am upgrading my review to 4 out of 5 stars.  With the spawns about 90% better, the game is really decent.**Update 12/8/2013  Well I spoke too soon.  Spawns have progressively become worse and modded controllers are increasing.  I have always bought the season pass and DLCs for all CODs.  I am pretty much done contributing to the COD series."
1298432,B000EELFTW,I like it after I figured out how to make it work for me,I ordered both this one and the Lee Oskar.  I couldn't find a usable position with either and was about ready to return them both then noticed that the shoulder piece on the Hohner had &#34;raised&#34; ends.  I reversed this piece where the ends angle down instead of up and it works ok.  The quality appears good.  The springs that hold the harp in are STRONG but by holding the harp in my mouth and using both hands I can change harps without removing the rack.This was my first shoulder rack and I didn't know what to expect.  I have to have it adjusted exactly right to be able to go from harp to singing and it's challenging but I can get it done.

1805662,B007NC5GHA,Power to the...er...electronics,"This outlet arrived without issue in easy-to-open packaging.Installation was straight-forward for anybody familiar with changing out an outlet.  Be warned, this thing is deep.  For my 1950s-vintage house, the outlet was on the tight side of fitting into a single-gang box.  The terminals for the outlet are well made and accepted wire without issue.The USB ports charge without problem and the green LED on the face of the receptacle is a nice indicator that it is working.  It handles my phone wihtout any issues.  The only problem I have is that the charger does not provide enough power to charge my Asus Transformer Prime.  This is annoying, but I knew this might be a problem going into this from some of the other reviewers on this site and cannot justify taking a star from the outlet because it does not work for my devices.Overall a good purchase that I have been happy with."

1303211,B00646MZHK,Inexpensive Gem,"I don't play professionally so there is no need to buy expensive pedal tuners such as Hardwire HT-6, Polytune or Korg Pitchblack.  I researched for other alternatives and decided on a ""clip on"" tuner.  I narrowed it down to 3 - Korg AW2, Snark SN-1 & Intelli IMT-900.  All 3 have a lot of positive reviews and all of them are under $20.  I visited each manufacturers' website for more information and found out about the Snark SN-8.  Snark claims that it's their best tuner yet.  If their SN-1 can go toe to toe with the others, then I would assume that their best will do even better.  I took the plunge and ordered one.  I have only 2 requirements for a tuner:1.  It should be accurate.2.  It should be fast.The Snark SN-8 delivered on both counts and more!  It came with other extras like ""tap tempo metronome"", ""super tight tuning"", ""pitch calibration"", ""transpose features"" etc.  I may not have any use for all of them right now but it's nice to have them at your fingertips.  You can use it for other instruments as well but I only use it for my guitars.  The SN-8 is small & unobtrusive.  The display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like.  After tuning, I turn it off and put it back in the guitar case.  I don't like it hanging in my guitar!  Of course, it doesn't stay long because it tunes fast!  For under $20, these little tuner is all you need.....fast and accurate.  Try it, you won't be disappointed."
2829686,B000BK537Y,Wonderful,"I agree with other reviewers that Mischa Maisky's performance is stunning - at this point in the concert everything seems to fall into place.  His performance of two pieces is very moving and perfect for the occasion.  I couldn't find anything to criticise in the rest of the concert, not that I was looking to.  Some of the choices of repertoire made are perhaps less accessible than Western audiences are used to hearing, but it was a refreshing concert that made me concentrate and kept me riveted from beginning to end and so was all the more interesting for that.  It is as much a cultural excursion into St Petersburg - and I liked the changes in scene as the camera often pans across the audience, one soloist, Dmitri, gets his flowers half way through his performance (obviously just a mistake), people are dressed very casually, the hall is obviously stiflingly hot - a treasure worth buying and savouring of world class performers. Buy it for Mischa Maisky's performance alone. You won't be disappointed.  The picture quality as well is crystal clear."
220393,B00068S85K,A whole capsule is a dangerous dosage,"I made a mistake and purchased Swanson's Yohimbe (extract) instead of Swanson's Yohimbe Bark. The bark in one capsule dose was relatively mild and not always efficacious. The Yohimbe extract is a different beast altogether. Thinking I was taking the bark, I swallowed an entire capsule.  Suddenly, I had the worst heart palpitations in my life. I felt like I was sprinting but sitting down didn't stop the racing heart. After about 30-40 minutes of utter fear, I realized that death was not imminent, and calmed down, but not nearly enough to enjoy a  night's sleep.Someone online with the same problem suggested taking the capsule apart and using the powder that remained in the smaller capsule end. This created similar problems but not nearly as scary.  The reason I am not giving this product a single star is because a quarter of a capsule really works!  But there have been times when I have become lightheaded and nauseous before breaking out into a heavy cold sweat. This has happened three or four times. A night's sleep afterwards is nothing but fits and starts, maybe three hours out of seven in bed actually asleep.I have recently found a better product with similar but less intense side effects. Yohimbe Bark Extract - Standardized to 3% Yohimbine HCL - 100 mg x 100 Capsules by Real Herbs.  At $29 for 100 tiny capsules, it is much more expensive than Swanson's, but the experience is not nearly as scary.  The Real Herbs extract is standardized to 3% vs 2% for Swanson's. Where the Swanson's is a 500 mg capsule amount, the Real Herbs is only 100mg. Since I used only a quarter of the Swanson's cap, the amount ingested was about 125 mg for the Swanson's vs. 100mg for the Real Herbs caps. This makes the Real Herbs almost 4 X as expensive, but since the cost per capsule comes out to only twenty-nine cents each, I'm not about to complain.  In fact, I would highly recommend to Swanson's that they pack their fire-powder into 100 mg mini-capsules to avoid causing someone an untimely death.One last point, the Swanson's gives an erection with a life of its own. This is great if your mind tends to wander, but is also a bit less rewarding than a natural hard-on. By contrast, the Real Herbs extract produces an erection that feels like its part of you instead an attachment. May not be as foolproof, but it feels more like yourself."

So if you have a passenger car set to go from Washington to Baltimore, and there is some lumber that can go as well, it won't get ship unless you click on it.  I prefer RT3 because it will ship this automatically, yet you can still chose what you want to ship if you need to get certain supplies to a factory you own.

The graphics are high def, and the controls are good too.  Still Nascar 2002 despite being over 4 years old still is pleasing to the eyes for every Nascar fan.  It has all the teams and cars from the 2002 season, and it has a creation mode.  You can create and paint your own Winston Cup cars and race them on the real tracks.  Long before EA's Nascar series, Papyrus and Sierra scored huge with their Nascar series.

Despite the games tiny size...400mb compared to EA's 1.1gb...this game delivers on the track.  Did I mention the sound is awesome too?

1816493,B00CKRU3UI,Very cool effects,My son LOVES this item.  It projects very cool wave like light effects onto your ceiling.  There are several different color and effect settings.  Very simple and easy to use.  Just plug in the included USB/AC wall plug adapter and press the power button and away it goes.  Continue to press the power button to toggle through the different light effect settings.  This is a VERY cool item at a great price.

7464,B001IATYMQ,Others recommended OtterBox to me and now I'll do the same,"Since getting my iPhone several months ago I have been through several cases.  Of course some were more style than function, so I continued looking for one that would provide both. No less than three friends and acquaintances suggested I look into OtterBox and recently I finally did. Because I am a bargain shopper I decided to try out this basic blackImpact Case for iPhone.  It was easy to get my phone into it and I liked that it also included a screen protector.I've had it on my phone for a while now and I haven't had any issues. It provides great grip, easy access to all the buttons and cosmetic protection from falls. I have noticed that because of the silicone it will attract fuzz and dust, but if you remove it from your phone it can be rinsed under the faucet to remove any. Definitely a good product and this item was particularly at a good price. I'll continue to give OtterBox my business and recommend them to friends."

1755136,B001AOVBHG,Limited use,"The camera head is about 3"" long by "" in diameter with a bending diameter of around 7"" and a total usable length without an extension about 3'-3"". This in itself is pretty limited getting into tight and long reached areas. I had to read a nameplate on a piece of machinery that was about 8"" off the back wall and this inspection camera was useless. It was impossible to bend and position the camera at right angle to read the prints on the nameplate. Further, the screen was upside down with no provision to flip the screen right side up electronically like the other camera I have. Adjusting the LED light intensity just put up a hot spot on the screen making the nameplate over exposed and impossible to read. Ended up doing it the old fashion way - sticking my head in with a flashlight to read the nameplate.  For under $100, I'll keep it and found a use for it later."

382804,B0033ZHIJU,Not for all men,"Dosage is suggested as 4 tablets a day. I took two in the AM and two before going to bed. I was awaken by my prostate, being sore.

1479079,B004NRN5EO,"Starts out challenging and fun, ends up pointlessly difficult.","I'm fine with games being hard, that actually one of the reasons I liked this game initially.  The trouble is by the time you get to Anor Londo you'll _notice_ that pointless death traps become common place, and yes I'm talking about the Javilin archers shooting at you while you run across a 2 inch buttress.  When a Javilin hits you automatically are thrown back a few feet which is interesting in this case as it's your first encounter with them and it causes instant death.  Death traps were interesting and challenging in Sens Fortress (the castle of traps), but annoying, frustrating, and pointless in Anor Londo and beyond.  I was almost able to accept this in an otherwise great game, but then I also noted that the punishment for death started to become longer and longer runs back to the point of death and I reject this as a reasonable game design decision, much less a good one.  While many console gamers may have become accustomed to uncreative programming hack tricks to increase difficulty, it seems to be the bread and butter of the console world after all, but I consider it unacceptable.  This game reminds me a lot of World of Warcraft in this respect: A massive amount of fun turns into a pointless running exercise after level 30.  Grant it that it was a pretty pointless running exercise before then, but when you start to notice how long the running is and how much more running you're doing than having fun it is my firm belief that there is a problem with that game.  But the boss fights are pretty great, and the game is awesome for most of the time I played it but the slightly unbalanced PvP system, pointless prevalence of death traps, inane amount of running, and boss recycling was finally too much and I lost my favorable opinion of this game (I completed 80% of the game. I didn't complete Abyss, Lost Izalith, or Kiln of the First Flame, it was more worthwhile for me to sell it by that point about a month after release).  Fight the Asylum Demon, fight a stronger version of him, fight an even stronger version of him in a smaller space with challenging terrain.  In a game that initially felt so fun and polished its a shame they resorted to simple time wasting and cheap deaths to ""increase the challenge"".  If you quit by level 40 though, you may be lucky enough to leave with only fantastic memories (but you'll still have wasted a fantastic amount of time)."

3753561,B001QT9KO6,Worked on my tractor,"I have a 1964 John Deere 2010 (model) Diesel crawler tractor.  These are rather well known for coolant leaks into the oil from some rubber seals around the cylinders where they meet the block.  It's a big job to open up the engine and replace these rubber seals.  While I don't know for sure that this is where my leak was, it is likely.  I was loosing a quart to the oil in a couple months when it sat around and some when it was running as well.  After adding the K-Seal and a dozen heat up cool down tractor uses, I don't seem to be getting anymore coolant in the oil.  I bought a second bottle of K-Seal to keep around.  I think that this stuff works, at least in my situation, it has."
1482061,B004V9QC80,Pain in the A**,"Bought this game last week thinking it would be nice to check it out as I used to play Final Fantasy on playstation.  Well, I downloaded the game, and after installing I found out I had to sign up for Playonline.com as well as Square-enix.com.  I did this, using passwords I reserve only for games so I dont have to worry about forgetting them.  As this is one of a few passwords I use, I knew I would now forget what they were.  Well, after hours and hours and hours of trying to log into the game, and trying to fix the problem on their websites and not being able to fix anything, I finally called customer support.  I was told to reset the password at the website, and then to call back as they were only allowed so many minutes to talk per customer that they talk to.  So I changed the password, called back, and was told the problem is with the Playonline Viewer that comes up when you try to start the game.  I was told to uninstall and reinstall the Viewer, and that by doing that it would ask me for new passwords etc., and that it would then work.  Well, its still not working, and I am beyond frustrated.  I want to return the game and get my money back, but there does not seem to be an option for that.Update:  Ok, after playing around with uninstalling and reinstalling and going back to their website and being more thoroughly confused, somehow I have fixed it and am now waiting for a 24000 file update in the launcher.  Sheesh!Couple weeks later now, and I still dont play the game.  I play warcraft, so I guess I am spoiled in the way the controls are set up, but it makes it so much easier to do simple things.  I am probably going to cancel my account, after all the hours spent on getting it working."
1490027,B0050SYUAS,Suprisingly Good Workout,"I'm a rugby player and a former boxer, so I've always been a bit skeptical of video game workouts, but Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 made a believer out of me. I figured I could handle whatever it threw at me - but I was wrong. I was dripping with sweat 20 minutes into playing it.Some of my favorite features are the games where you are competing against yourself for a higher score - so if you are in good shape you still are striving to get into better shape. Some of the games are deceptively difficult - like the game of blowing up balloons by flapping your arms and doing squats. It started off easy enough but after 1 minute my arms were tired and after two minutes I could barely lift them above my head. Even the simple and fun games like jump rope or soccer kick kept the blood flowing and the heart rate up.I enjoy the data tracking and calorie burn aspects of the game almost as much as the workouts themselves. From unlocking the Xbox achievements to having it track your time playing it keeps the mind engaged and incents you to work that much harder. It's the perfect workout solution for those days when it's too cold, wet or dark to work out outside. Definitely a great addition to the Xbox games lineup."
1815601,B00BWA3ZFO,A powerful LITTLE light for your candelabra,"As a top reviewer, we are occasionally offered complimentary products for review - this one was generously offered to me by the manufacturer, so I agreed. Once it arrived, I realized I didn't have the right socket to test it, until I grabbed an old string of Christmas lights with the large socket. It is a candelabra light, and if you are looking here, I suspect it is exactly the kind of light you want.This was my first experience with an LED light and I am suitably impressed. Here are some first impressions:It is shatterproofIt is brightIt does have a nice black base, just like the photo, kind of surprising for me in a light bulb ... but it looks classy is the best way to describe it.I timed it, and it did last 50,000 hours without going out. JUST KIDDING - longevity is one thing I really can't test with a lifetime this long, I would be testing it for nearly six years.Nevertheless, as far as I can tell, this is far superior to the previous glass bulbs while saving energy and your electric bill.The one thing I would mention is that if you replace your bulb you replace all of them at the same time with the same type of bulb to give your candelabra a uniform look. We currently have an overhead in the living room with a different size bulb where we didn't take my advice - it is funny to look at because the different bulbs that ended up there have different amounts of ""white"" - making the color uneven."
1655050,B005XVZKGA,did not enjoy it,"I did not enjoy this product. It did not taste just like plain water. It has a certain level of carbonation and a weird taste to it. Not enough to be considered carbonated water though, I guess. It just taste like you opened a bottle of fizzy a few days ago and forgot to finish it. There are better ways to get your caffeine in, if you need it."

3759549,B006E3SJZA,Not Willing to Trade My Incandescent Bulbs for These,"Attracted to their low price, I tried substituting these LED bulbs for the filament bulbs in a couple of my motorhome's overhead fixtures hoping I'd eventually be able to replace all of my incandescent bulbs to save power.  To make the electrical connection, I had to pry the wires from the base slightly.  Once I did that, and ensured that the polarity was correct, all of the LEDs in the bulbs came on.  But even with all of them working the light output was nowhere near as much as I was getting from my filament bulbs.  Though these are advertised as being ""white"" the color of the light was a cool light blue, casting a not-at-all warm light.  The difference in light color and light intensity between these LED bulbs and my regular incandescent filament bulbs was dramatic.  As much as I would like to reduce my lighting power consumption which would, of course, greatly increase the time I could light my coach before having to charge my batteries, these won't do it for me.  Sadly, I must continue looking for warmer, brighter LED bulbs."

1334312,B00006AALC,A major disappointment,"The Broken Sword series marked my entry into the adventure game genre, for as a mostly console gamer, I ignored a large number of classic PC titles.  Those games, and The Longest Journey got me hooked, and so I thought I'd check out Syberia which seemed to offer much of the same formula.But that common formula of obscure puzzles and pre-rendered backgrounds was about all that Syberia had shared with those classics.  The game's plot - which in all adventure games is the make-or-break factor - is completely underwhelming.  Perhaps it is unfair to compare Syberia to Broken Sword or TLJ instead of evaluating it independently, but there is really very little substance to this game no matter how you look at it.In fact, it is only by virtue of a storyline that adventure games' often frustrating mechanics and obscure puzzle solutions are even tolerable.  Without a story, an adventure game - much like Syberia - is quite unfulfilling."

The housing is very heavy and then the addition of D batteries makes it even heavier. Not for casual carrying around in your pocket and especially not for backpacking. The flashlight is attached to the inner cardboard with substantial black plastic bands that are not designed to be untwisted and could not be cut with either household scissors or my Leatherman knife. As soon as an item is this hard to liberate from packaging, it poses a hazard to both the buyer and the item itself as such strength/force is needed. Hint: finally I used needlenose pliers to sharply twist the heavy bonds and managed to get them to snap. But better yet, have serious metal snips available. Mine are SOMEWHERE but I didn't want to take an hour to find them.Worse yet, when I loaded the batteries and screwed the well-machined metal cap back on, the light refused to function. So I repeated that step and during the second installation of the cap, there was a brief flash of light. Finished tightening the cap, fooled around with the concept that maybe it needed to be a little loose - nope - finally lightly tapped the light on a wooden desk and the connection was made, we had LUX ! But this is not a good sign as it means a faulty connection somewhere within."
1819247,B00FN1LP1Y,"Okay Lantern, Poor Flashlight","I didn't care that much for this ""flantern"" and I'll tell you why. First, it came with zero instructions, so it took me a few minutes to figure out how it works. ""How dumb are you?"" you're probably thinking. Well, the thing is, this lantern has no less than five ""bumps"" that look like they could be click-on switches. I tried each of them in turn, but only one actually turned the light on. Of the others, one was the hidden charging port, two were nothing but decoration, and one is supposed to allow you to adjust the handle into flashlight-mode.That's my second complaint. You're supposed to be able to push this button and angle the handle down, turning the lantern into a flashlight. Mine doesn't work very well. If I push VERY hard and pull on the handle with all my strength, I can get it to move down, but it's extremely difficult. Also, I think the handle was put on backwards, because the finger grips go the wrong way. If I hold it so it's comfortable, the flashlight shines right in my face!My third complaint is that my lantern arrived with a large crack in the clear plastic. It was packaged with lots of air-packs, so I don't know how the damage occurred, unless at the factory. It doesn't render the lantern unusable, but it is kind of annoying that a brand-new product would be broken upon arrival.So, what do I like about this lantern? It's nice that you can keep it plugged in and ready to go in an emergency. The only problem is, suppose your power stays out for a long time and the battery dies? You have no way of recharging it. It isn't like you can just pop a few new batteries in. I really like the plastic loop on top that lets you hang the lantern, so you can use it while camping. That's a plus in my book. In theory, the switch between lantern and flashlight is good, but like I said, the flashlight handle doesn't convert easily on mine, and the grip is backwards, so it fails in that regard. Another good point is that it's really bright.Two stars because it's an okay lantern, if hard to use. But if you really want the convertibility between lantern and flashlight, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.Edited to add (6/10/14): I took this lantern on a camping trip and used it to help me find the bathroom in the middle of the night. On my way back, I got hopelessly lost. Not an experience I would care to repeat, let me tell you! I was grateful to have the flashlight/lantern, but it wasn't enough to keep me on the correct path. I ended up having to completely retrace my steps back to the bathroom, and still managed to get lost AGAIN. The light just wasn't bright enough or wide enough of a beam for me to see the path I was supposed to take. So again, this lantern/flashlight fails. I wanted to like it, I truly did. But it did NOT live up to my expectations."

3472283,B0095HHM78,Beyond disasterous,"Cloud Atlas includes the stellar acting talents of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Susan Sarandon among others. The talented cast is the only area that I could see where Cloud Atlas excells. Despite those talents, Cloud Atlas is one of the most muddled and disjointed video presentations (I refuse to denigrate ""movies,"" even including those winners of the dreaded ""Raspberry"" awards by referring to this disaster as a ""movie"").I strongly urge anyone who is considering purchasing and viewing Cloud Atlas to do themselves a favor: Go wash and clean the toilet.

The action occurs in the courts of France and Spain, nations on the verge of war. Bob Hope is Monsieur Beaucaire, the King Louis XV's barber forced to impersonate a duc named Le Chandre, or lose his head. At the same time, in Madrid, the traitorus Don Francisco commander of the spanish Army, wants to prevent the upcoming marriage of Le Chandre with Maria (a Spanish princess) and plans eliminate a Bob Hope, in order to destabilize the crown, unleashing a war between the countries. At the end, we see a Bob avoid the homicidal plans with lots of comic situations and gags. Very very Funny!&quot;Where There's Life&quot; (1947), a year later Bob had a royal performance, when he is convinced by the General Katrina Grimovitch (Signe Hasso) that he is the heir of Barovia, and must ascend to the throne in order to let organized the fist democratic election in the country avoiding that an evil organization take the control. Of course this is a good excusefor persecutions and gags of all kind.

1876034,B000OYC3J8,Don't forget me,"All ""Icky Thump"" initially brought to mind was Graham Chapman telling Terry Jones how to say, ""Eee, ecky thump!"" into a mike.But it's also the title of the White Stripes' sixth album, and after the mediocre dry spell of ""Get Behind Me Satan,"" it's nice to hear that the Stripes seem to have regained their creative juices. This time they pack the album with dark seventies-style rock'n'roll and some traditional folk flourishes.It kicks off with the dark, plodding guitar that blazes up to life every few seconds, and a sinuous synth ripple that slithers through the melody. ""Icky thump/Who'da thunk?/Sittin drunk on a wagon to Mexico?"" Jack yowls, describing the less pleasant corners of Mexico, and taking a moment to jab at Americans (""Why don't you kick yourself out/You're an immigrant too!"").It softens up a lot for the catchy, bluesier rocker ""You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told),"" and the mellow gritty ""300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues."" Then the album goes through two phases: the first is one of British and Scottish folkiness, and a trumpety rocker that sounds like a B-side from Beirut. Then the last leg of the album slips back to blazing rock'n'roll, full of dark energy and retro organ.I never quite figured out what was going on in the halfhearted ""Get Behind Me Satan,"" except that every band has their dud. And fortunately ""Icky Thump"" is everything that album wasn't -- spirited, creative, enthusiastic, and full of those little moments and brilliant instrumentation that bring it alive. Nice to see they haven't run out of juice yet.Yeah, we have Jack blazing away like a forest fire on his guitars, whether it's softer blues riffs, ringing blasts or hard-rocking swirls. And Meg smashes the drums like no other. But their music is festooned with a colourful array of extra instrumentation -- sweeps of eerie, vintage psychedelic synth, sprightly gypsyish trumpets, and even bagpipes for the mesmerizing ""St. Andrew (This Battle Is In The Air).""Jack seems to have regained his verve as well: he sounds assured and a little sad, and his quirky voice has a new depth and power. But he hasn't lost his melancholy edge, singing of Mexican robberies, stream of consciousness love songs, the rag and bone man, and a man who loves a woman so deeply, he lets her go so he won't make her unhappy.And Meg gets to display her clear voice a few times -- she gets to talk with Jack in ""Rag & Bone,"" and the eerie Scottishy ballad ""St. Andrew (This Battle Is In The Air)"" has her murmuring a prayerlike song over a bagpipe/drum melody. (""This battle is in the air/I'm looking upwards/where are the angels?/I'm not in my home!"").""Icky Thump"" is both a wonderful return to form, and a foray into new territory for the White Stripes. A glorious experience, and it only gets better with repeated listens. A triumph."

1699692,B00005NMUN,A Toy,"This product works as stated for a short time, but after a few hours of steady use, it becomes desensitized and will not respond as it did on previous occasions. The sensitivity screw setting is also MADDENING when it as the hours go on!It is NOT an investment at all in a wood shop, especially if you are in reclamations of antique lumber and trying to protect expensive machinery. Just another $70 extracted from the pockets of busy consumers.Forget it ! The only reason why I gave it one star is because it does detect aluminum when it IS working, whereas most beach-comber type detectors don't.Even fresh batteries don't effect it when it is having fits of desensitization.Where can I get a Secret Service style detection device?"
1550286,B000EVOSE4,Very tough to chew,I don't know if I got a bad bag or what from the good reviews I have read but these were the toughest gummi bears I have ever had.  They were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt.  I still have about four pounds remaining after a couple months now since they aren't enjoyable to eat.  The taste isn't the greatest either unless you let them set in you mouth for a while but the toughness just makes them very unenjoyable.  Maybe its just a bad bag but I have no reason to say these are good if they weren't and that is my experience so far.
1409742,B00170BV6E,Pure Frustration - For One Player,"This is what video game racing is all about.  It doesn't matter whether it's race cars, street cars, motorcycles or ATV's.""Pure"" is among the new generation of titles that deliver on the promise of next generation racing.  The visuals are lush and amazing (gone are the days when you couldn't see 50 feet up the road).  The controls are smooth and responsive.  There are a lot of tracks to choose from.  And the physics are intense, whether you're looking for a straight race or a tricked-out thrill ride.However - this is why I wouldn't buy it.  Gamers have evolved.  We no longer sit in our parent's basement by ourselves playing video games.  For me, gaming is more of a social event.  There's nothing I like better than getting together with my friends and racing against each other.But ""Pure"" (and most other new racing games) are only for one (local) player.  Sure, I can race multiple real-life opponents online, but it's just not the same.  And until PS3 and the developers realize this I will hold off on purchasing any more racing games."
3610835,B000634MXM,Useless,"I was looking for a safety seat for my dog, and this is definitely NOT it. Doesn't come with any sort of belt or restraint, this is really just an expensive booster seat. If that's what you're looking for, I guess it's ok. It feels cheap for the price, and the colors were quite washed out compared to the bright plaid in the picture. I bought a harness and strap to attach to the seatbelt in my car, and my dog has no problem with it, and is safe. This chair looks ridiculous in the car and provides no additional safety."

1301142,B002Q0WSO8,Great tuner for acoustic instruments,"I use this all the time for acoustic guitar/banjo/mandolin, as well as an autoharp and my daughter's fiddle. I'll be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case (wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard). This works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused. For my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open G even if it's too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well. I've used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the job.Nobody really gets excited about tuners, but I've been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that I know of when I started out. If you wanted to tune and didn't have a 1/4"" input, good luck."

1691155,B0000225QR,A smooth workhorse that is a joy to use and a pleasure to own.,"For those who just dream of a a great woodworking shop, to those of us fortunate to have this saw, WE KNOW THAT THE TABLE SAW IS THE FOCUS TOOL OF THE SHOP. If you truly desire precision then consider the things I have found to be so well made on my Powermatic 66. While I have heard of others without the same great experience, I know for a fact that Powermatic is more than willing to satisfy you. I will comment on the design and their top notch materials that I believe make this a great cabinet saw.1. OUTSTANDING HEAVY FLAT TABLE - absolutely a dead flat piece of art. DO NOT TRY TO CLEAN THIS WITH ANYTHING BUT WHAT POWERMATIC RECOMMENDS. The mirror like finish is a ""blanchard grind"" unlike anything else available. It makes you want to clean, buff and wax it regularly.2. NO VIBRATION - the super heavey trunion and other heavy iron constitute it's ability to absorb vibration. This makes for smoother, safer cuts.3. QUIET - for a table saw this things just purrs. GET THE 5 HP model - if you're spending this kind of money I IMPLORE you to find the extra couple hundred dollars.4. TIGHT TOLERANCES - This unit was built with great machining so you can set this up within thousand's of an inch. TAKE THE TIME TO FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIONS - this will pay off for years. They have designed this to be true, square and flat. It's up to you to follow the directions.5. GREAT MANUALS - GREAT TELEPHONE SUPPORT - I probably will shock you when I tell you I never owned a table saw until this one. I simply knew the reviews and everyone I spoke with couldn't all be nuts so I spent the big money only wanting to do this once. I have used it for 2.5 years constantly. I am a nut for good instructions since I need them. Their manuals and support let a guy like me set it up from scratch with no pounding or swearing at the thing.6. A TRUE, SQUARE, ACCURATE & EASY TO USE FENCE - Now, a fence could be the most important thing you use. I am absolutely amazed how dead square this thing stays REGARDLESS of what type of big panels, wood or melamine I put past it. I sometimes have to place a dial gauge just to believe it stays so true. I have NEVER had to make any major adjustments in 2.5 years!!! I kid you not when I tell you that sometimes I scratch my head in wonderment that things are still made this well. AGAIN, I BEG YOU TO TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU SET IT UP!! IT WILL PAY FAITHFUL DIVIDENDS I PROMISE YOU.7. THE MOTOR - Well, a 5HP seemed like overkill to me too until I started using it through 3"" maple, etc. Then the ""smoothness of real power"" shows it's benefit - no burns, no laboring, just glass smooth cuts (with a sharp blade of course)8. CLEAN UP - Yep, I clean it and cover it after every day I use it. But it's simple since the cabinet is designed to be so accessible to the motor. The dust chute is engineered so the wood dust is angled to the chute at the bottom.  I also invested in a plastic shroud that also accepts a hose.9. GREAT ACCESSORIES - I have the matching rolling base, extra long black table and cabinet underneath that, everything fit perfectly.  The miter gauge is absolutely surprising how solid and square it is.  Many times I use it over my expensive Osborne3.10. THE GOLD AND BLACK COLORS - Hey, sounds goofy doesn't it? But you know what? It looks great against the natural wood all over my shop. I'm not a commercial business so ""grey"" wasn't for me. It's at my home and I want it to look inviting for the neighbors to stop in, learn and just talk about things to be.I hope that helps you all. My experience has been great, if yours is the same it will inspire you to use it more and more. Before you know it you've created things you never imagined possible. I suppose that's what a great tool really does -""inspires"""
1821592,B00000016W,Cool album!,"This album was originally released on and is still distributed by Capitol Records. Capitol's original catalog number is DT 2458 for the stereo LP and T 2458 for the mono LP. The stereo copies were ""duophonic"",meaning they could only be played on stereo phonographs for maximum sound quality. But then again,you'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph. Stereo LP copies of THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS were ""duophonic"" also. Hits from this album include SLOOP JOHN B.,GOD ONLY KNOWS and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE?. This album was a best-seller when it was released in 1966. The Beach Boys were still in their teen idol phase then as was their Capitol labelmates,The Beatles and Peter & Gordon. Also then,Brian Wilson began to have problems with drugs. He'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duties on the stage to Bruce Johnston. All the other songs are good."

3610226,B000634IUO,How I use this product on my Maltese,"It's the ears that tend to get matted on my maltese that is eleven months old.  I brush and comb him thru-out the day so he does stay mat free for the most part.  However, he does get an occasional mat and especially at and under his ears.  I bath him once a week.  AFTER towel drying, I spray an amount into my hand and run it thru his coat.  I do this several times.  It's too cold generally to spray it directly on him.  I'd say I use about a teaspoon in total.  Primarily I am running over his head over and under the ears and down the back side to his tail.  I then blow dry him.  I brush him.  I then take a metal comb, and comb his ears gently.  There is generally a wad of hair matted up under his ears.  I then take the spray bottle and saturate the mat.....I work the mat as loose as I can with my fingers, then I use the metal comb to work thru the mat.  I do NOT rinse the product out of my dogs hair.  The directions do NOT tell you to rinse it out.  The directions tell you to rinse the shampoo out and then proceed to use this product."
3746888,B000C9R1D8,Just as expected!,"I needed to replace a defective gas cap for my 2005 Corvette due to a known defect with the original caps in this model year.

Part works exactly as I expected and I recommend it to others who need a replacement for their Corvette gas caps."
1825326,B000001DZO,Everyone Should Own This,"If you're ever in need of a pure pop collection that you can guarantee everyone will be dancing to, it's ABBA's ""Gold: Greatest Hits."" Wherever you party this Christmas, it is likely that in the midst of sweat, drink and fags, an ABBA record will be playing somewhere. No matter what your age or musical tastes, ABBA released a string of hits you could sing along to. Whether you were a bouncing baby in a highchair, or you wrinkled with your grand-parents, everyone thanked ABBA for the music. When ABBA entered and won the Eurovision Song Contest in April 1974, many saw them as a one-hit wonder outfit. But the success of ABBA during the 1970's and early 1980's has been compared to that of another famous quartet who made their fortune between 1962 and 1970...As with that other famous quartet, ABBA's popularity still stands today. This collection of hits was released in the early 1990's and still managed to top the UK album charts in early 1999 when an ABBA revival say thousands of teenagers flock to stores and pick up a copy of this album. The song which single-handidly saw the ABBA mania hit the UK once more was ""Dancing Queen,"" the massive US and UK No.1. Often voted one of the best songs i history, this song is every bit a classic. It still sounds fresh and catchy today as it did more than 25 years ago. ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" and ""Take A Chance On Me"" maintain the catchy camp factor, while ""Mamma Mia"" is so famous it spawned a popular catchphrase along with a West End musical of the same name. ""Lay All Your Love On Me"" is a masterpiece of epic proportions. It has such an atmosphere that you can't help be absorbed by.""Super Trouper"" has sunlit vocals and a majestic chorus that swings along, ""I Have A Dream"" speaks of the perfect world, while ""The Winner Takes It All"" is an emotional and powerful look at the fall of a relationship. ""Money Money Money"" not only has a classy piano introduction alongside some wonderful vocals, but a certain sense of irony. Singing of being poor and longing for money as they raked in their millions! ""S.O.S."" and ""Chiquita"" are two of my favourite ABBA songs, because they can be listened to at any time of day and at any point in your life.  The soaring choruses, melodic verses and emotional vocals go hand-in-hand as the perfect duo. ""Fernando"" has an almost royal feel to it, with a classy and beautiful chorus filled with love and passion. ""Voulez-Vous"" is an absolute disco stomper than remains in my Top 3 of favourite ABBA songs ever. I don't understand why this is not their most popular song, because it definitely should be! ""Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)"" shows how incredible coy and innocent ABBA could seem, even when singing about one-night stands.""Does Your Mother Know"" draws its energy from classic 1950's rock 'n' roll, while the lesser known ""One Of Us"" has a bouncy beat that carries the song along. ""The Name Of The Game"" is perhaps the only letdown from this album, which is easily forgotten with the majestic ""Thank You For The Music."" A tribute single entitled ""Thank ABBA For The Music"" was released in 1999 and peaked inside the UK Top 5, but it has nothing on the original. The album closes with ABBA's first ever song, ""Waterloo."" The song that won them the Eurovision is where it all began.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10This collection has shifted more than 3 million copies in the UK, and millions more worldwide. No other album spent longer on the album charts in the UK throughout the 1990's. The years just passed by and this album would not budge! America didn't take as much notice of ABBA as the UK did, which I think is a great shame because they are, without question, one of the greatest pop groups ever. There are some greatest hits collections that everyone owns like Madonna's ""The Immaculate Collection,"" and ABBA's Gold: Greatest Hits should definitely be in there! Buy it now, you know you want to."
1876718,B000VJE1OG,"No, it just feels like forever","If you thought I was wrong comparing these goth madonnas to Depeche Mode the last time around, the comparisons are even more obvious and the territory more redundant on ""Forever."" It's about as dark as Mickey Mouse in a wizard skirt. Halfway through ""Written in Blood,"" I could swear somebody chimes in with the Inspector Gadget theme. But hey, an apologist might say, their music might be a tad simplistic but I just adore them for their deep, introspective lyrics.OK, let's take a listen: guy meets girl; guy realizes girl is eating him alive from the inside; guy realizes this is inevitable because we are all just selfish, vacuous beasts; guy ultimately realizes he is stuck with said succubus until the end of time. So it's definitely goth. I mean, no wonder so many chicks are into the goth scene: fag hags who latch onto overly emotional wallflowers when seeking out life partners so they can wrap the twerps around their mealy fingers. But really, there's no Billy Bragg -- or even dimbulb Jackson Browne for that matter -- at work in these words. I think ""Melrose Place"" and other shows have sufficiently covered these boy-meets-girl themes.By the time ""She Will Always Be a Broken Girl"" comes withering out of the speakers, it sounds like I'm listening to a band at the end of its tether, completely immersed in some self-destructive form of electronic masturbation. Sadly, after ""This is the End,"" there are still five more songs to go. And boy, do they ever trounce on this dead horse. It's a mockery of a mockery. A ball of energy imploding. Innards spilling out at a car wreck. Turn away. Walk away."

The color was an odd nude color that actually made it look like I had no lips! There was no plumping effect at all, no tingling, no flushing, nothing. If you want a real plumper try either Soap & Glory's Sexy Mother Plucker or Clinician's Complex Lip Enhancer- both are pricy, but they actually provide results. For something cheaper, I've heard good things about Sally Hansen's lip plumper, but I haven't tried it myself."

The minute I saw the word ""megafudge"" I envisioned rich, gooey chocolate melting in my mouth. Sadly, this was not the case. The cookies taste rather dry, they aren't particularly sweet and each one left a strange chalky aftertaste in my mouth. The texture is more like cookie dough than fudge. The little white chocolate chips sprinkled into each cookie don't have any flavor to them. If you had told me these were reduced fat cookies, like SnackWells, I would have believed you. Since they're not, I'd rather indulge in something that actually tastes good since my waistline will be paying for it!"
137067,B00A53AILS,Just Okay - provides marginal protection,"I intended to purchase a case to protect the telephone and to keep it from sliding when set down in the car. This case only provides marginal protection but does not adequately keep the phone from moving in the car when set down.Pros:The case does protect the edges and back of the telephone and the plastic has a little &#34;squishiness&#34; to provide minimal shock absorption. I would rate it four stars for the protection.I ordered the blue color case and personally like the color, but I realize this is very subjective.Cons:1) The plastic case makes it hard to push and operate the cell phone buttons. With enough force you can use the buttons, but I find that I am frequently removing the case to operate the phone. I also note that the phone is more likely to be dropped without the case attached.  Based solely on the difficulty pushing the buttons I rate this feature one star.2)  The plastic case is somewhat slippery. As mentioned, I originally purchased the case hoping that the case would keep it from sliding on the dash of the car.  The last case I purchased for another phone was so &#34;sticky&#34; that it would keep the phone from moving on the dash and even would &#34;grab&#34; things in my pocket out of the pocket with the cell phone. I note that this case has &#34;grips&#34; on the side of the case to help stabilize the phone while it's in use - a nice feature. Because the case is slippery and does not prevent the cell phone from moving when placed on a dashboard, I rate this feature as two stars."
2530078,B00005JOY9,Amusing parody movie,"Ah yet another spoof movie, and I love it. The movie makes fun of so many films in this movie like Saw, The village, and Brookback Mountain (Yeah, that's right) to just name a few. I mean the people who make these movies still know humor, and it's funny as the others.Digital effects in this movie work pretty well, with few that are noticeable as CG. I think the only one that I remember being pretty obvious were the tentacles, but I didn't really care since the movie is just about the humor and not the CG shots.The sound track adds to the parody of the movie, and gets some laughs and does its job. Sound effects are just as funny as the other films. The acting is great, and you know these people like doing humor and are good at it. The fact they go through so many movies adds additional humor to people who have seen the films they are spoofing.They include a ton of special features on this DVD including behind the scenes, bloopers, deleted scenes, a funny commentary and so much more. For the 1600 screens saying that ""Commentaries do not reflect us blah blah blah"" why would they then beep stuff from it? I mean they say the F bomb, but censor something else. Granted it's only like 10 seconds, but it's still annoying.Also for PC users I don't recommend installing the Interactual player, but you won't notice it if you just watch movies through Media player and not ""run enhanced content"".If you like funny movies, or spoofs, than you will have a great time with this film.~ Written: August, 2010Positives:* Funny* A lot of movies that are spoofed* Funny commentary* Some effects are good....Negatives:* ...While some effects fail* A tiny bit of commentary was beeped out* Boo on the Interactual program"

You can't see the micro scratches easily on a white car, but you could see how smooth the surface was, and you could feel it.  I followed up with 3 coats of the Step 3 wax, and the car looks showroom new.  There is enough left in the bottle, after doing my full-size car, for at least another full-size car.  Good value!"
1549487,B000ER1EQI,The 6 box set of tiny crackers is a very long-lasting supply.  They're salty but better than others I've seen in terms of health,"I think this is the best choice for babies in the cracker category in terms of health and likability.  I had tried other types of crackers and they just threw them after biting into them. They like these and eat them and only sometimes throw them. Babies are amazing at how expressive they are when they don't want food offered to them.My ten month old twins eat these crackers, but not every time they're offered, and they're fairly healthy with the possible exception of saltiness.  They're by far the saltiest thing they eat.Considering that they need to put things in their mouths due to teething and basic discovery of the world, this is a great product to have on hand just to give them something edible that can go in the mouth.Getting it in a pack of 6 at this discount beats buying them one box at a time at the store.  I haven't seen this in a big box store yet, so I believe this must be one of the better deals at the moment.One box of these for babies around the age of mine (10 months) will last a long time.  The crackers are tiny and since they're so salty, they don't gobble them up.  When you get the 6 boxes, you've certainly got a long-lasting supply."

1845744,B000005J7X,The Corrs' Debut-and their best effort so far!,"I admit this in hesitation, folks, but I just don't care for the 3 gorgeous sisters and their brother's most recent release, &quot;Talk On Corners-Special Edition&quot; or even the original for that matter.  However, this album is a must for fans of the Rock-Pop mixed with classic  Celtic rythms genre, which of course, is truly an aquired taste. To me,  this CD's highlights are, the title track, &quot;F.N.F.&quot;, &quot;Heaven  Knows&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;The Right Time&quot;, the  &quot;Toss The Feathers&quot; instrumental (one of the best songs of that  kind that I have heard in a while, the other one I really like  would have  to be their &quot;Paddy McCarthy&quot; from &quot;T.O.C.&quot;), and  especially &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, which is my absolute favorite on  this album. Hey, I'm listening to that track now as I type this. As for the  slower songs, like &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;Love To Love You&quot; and  &quot;Closer&quot; (where you can really hear their Irish accent loud and  clear), I have to be in a certain calm and relaxed mood to enjoy them the  most. All in all, with the exception of the K-Klass remix of &quot;So  Young&quot;, I really do prefer this earlier material over their more  commerical stuff that they continuously perform live on numerous talk  shows. Along with U2, they are truly the greatest of the Irish music groups  of all time! Buy this CD!"
1300713,B001SC4I16,Super sweet,"For the price, this is a steal. If you can, snag a pack of new strings and it will sound tremendously better. All in all with new strings I only spent about $30 on this uke and I think that is more than fair.If you can't get new strings, the ones that come on it will survive you a little while (but stock strings on any instrument are never great). Also, if you don't know how to to tune an instrument/don't have a tuner, you don't need to buy one; if you have a smartphone or iPod touch there are accurate tuning apps for nearly any instrument, ukulele included!A little back story: I used to play instruments when I was younger but stopped in my preteens/early teens. It's something I've recently been regretting more than ever. So, I'm fixing that! Not only am I relearning the instruments I played before, but I picked up a new one - the ukulele! Like many others, I was inspired by Amanda Palmer to do so ;)Back to the review!:The sound of the ukulele is great. It's not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are. After a week or so it has no trouble staying in tune and rarely needs adjustments. It's very lightweight (which is good) but I don't think it would survive a fall. It's a fingerprint magnet, but that's about the only gripe I have. I plan on sticker'ing and painting it anyway :) The gig bag, as other as said, is basically just a dust jacket. I'm cool with that because that says to me that the majority of the money I spent on this ukulele really was for the ukulele, not the extras!For the price, this ukulele more than serves its purpose. I was worried that I'd regret not shelling out another $20 or $30 for a more frequently recommended ukelele, but I don't regret it at all.It's pretty easy to learn, especially if you have the littlest bit of musical knowledge or experience. Even if you don't, it shouldn't take you too long to be playing some songs! You have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere!This ukelele is perfect for a beginner or for someone who wants a cheap backup or travel option. Plus, it's not costly so if it breaks/gets lost/stolen/you choose to upgrade, you haven't lost a whole lot of money.This would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument. My little brother has been nagging me to get him a ukulele since I got one!That's about all! I will update if any problems arise in time.Don't hesitate. If you're new, don't worry about spending $50+ on something else (I mean, if you can and want to, go ahead!). This will be more than fine.Edit: Apparently, this thing fluctuates between $20-30. I was $24.95 when I got it. If it's $30, wait a few days and see if it goes down. I mean, it's worth the money but if you can save a little and spent that extra $5 on a new pack of strings, that would be even better.(I give it 4 stars and not 5 simply because while I have not played other ukuleles, I am certain that there ARE better. That's just how it is. The more $ you spend, the better. But this is definitely pretty solid over all for what it is and how much it costs!)"
1812725,B00ABC29DI,Nice kit,"The drill bits are more useful than I expected because I can use them with my 90 degree angle adapter to drill in tight corners.  The slimmest 90 degree adapters typically use hex bits like this rather than having normal drill chucks.The case is nicely designed so you tilt the piece at least 45 degrees and then it unlocks and you can pull it out.  It is easy to grab and pull each bit, and they don't fall out.The magnet in the extension piece is a strong magnet which should also help to magnetize the bits that slide into it."

1840246,B000002OJ4,Worst Since Victim of Love,"I'm amazed at the reviewers below who state that Leather Jackets is not one of Elton's best, but nevertheless give it 5 stars anyway.  The purpose of writing these reviews, after all, is to help potential buyers make  choices; this is not an Elton John fan forum.That said, to anyone who  might be contemplating buying this album, I have two words of advice: Stay  Away!  Take it from an EJ fan who's familiar (and objective) with all of  his work.  This one's a real stinker.  Even the borderline-hit Heartache  Over the World is mediocre; it only sounds decent because the songs  surrounding it are sub-par.  The only winner on this album, in my opinion,  is Hoop of Fire, a really lovely R&amp;B ballad.  The rest of this record,  though, is mechanical, synthesizer-driven, boredom.  The picture of Elton  looking tough as a motorcycle gang member is awful funny, but it ain't  worth the price of the CD."
1856204,B00005AAXE,You smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor and your eyes say the jokes on me!,"This is one of those albums that changed, maybe not my life, but definitely the way I looked at life and music.  It is Chris Carraba, a singer/songwriter that wears his heart on his sleeve, who plays his acoustic guitar with a no-nonsense, bare bones, stripped down, raw approach that begs for multiple listens.  Each song is biting, honest, and has lyrics that teeter on the edge of sarcastic and angry.  His heartfelt, ""emo"" approach launched him into the mainstream, earning a major label deal with Interscope and a cult following of teens/young adults, who while screaming/singing along with the lyrics, are basically saying, ""I have been through that"" or ""I am going through that.""  You believe every word that spits from Carabba's lips and the raw emotion often creates a cracked voice or a slightly imperfect note.  But it is these imperfections which make him so great.  It sort of reminds me of Johnny Cash's later albums, where the beauty lies in the lyrics and the passion behind the vocals.  Each song is catchy and relatable and pure poetry.  This a half an hour of raw talent, a sort of Bob Dylan of breakup.  For my money's worth, there are few better CD's.  Highlights include: Brilliant Dance, Screaming Infidelities, The Best Deception, Saints and Sailors, Standard Lines, and The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most."

6555,B001CK9OWM,Home Theater Sound for Tight Space (flawed battery compartment design),"Noticing that this particular unit had doubled in price within the last 2-3 months, I simply had to look into a possible explanation for the recent inflation.  In short, the sound of this audio frisbee (shaped like the popular CD players of a few years back, and not much larger in size) simply blew away any of the leading contenders with which I compared it.The smaller EQ5 is a nicely detailed little unit and should satisfy users not overly fastidious about the range and accuracy of musical reproduction (bass players, above all, had best stay away from it). If the EQ5 is worth the doubling of its price since the new year, then the JBL-built EQ7 would seem worth triple its former price. The sound has brightness and immediate ""presence"" lacking in speakers like the overrated Logitech Z515 (the audio in my 11"" Mac Air is almost as good). Moreover, the mid-range-- while forward, bright and clear--doesn't come at the expense of either bass or treble frequencies. Each of the pitches of the acoustic bass is clear and identifiable in the mix, while the ride cymbal sizzles with stunning verisimilitude and the grand piano resonates with transparent authenticity.The audio waves project upwards from four small speakers whose big sound (and sound stage) belies the size of their source. The unit functions equally well using AC power, or 4 AA batteries, or Bluetooth (it instantly paired with my Touch Generation 2).  Sadly, the speaker disappoints as a battery-powered unit because of the difficulty of removing the cover as well as installing the batteries.  Since I see that some dealers are asking nearly as much for the decisively inferior-sounding EQ5, I'd have to guess that the onboard rechargeable battery and convenient compactness of the EQ5 justify, in the mind of some users, the premium price.  Still, if you have a chance to listen to the EQ7 and have any interest in a unit whose fidelity is both ""high"" and ""true,"" it's doubtful that the EQ5 will remain a contender at any price.I've never heard so bright, rich, and pure a sound from anything this small. In fact, I'm surprised the EQ7 has, for the most part, been under the radar for so long. While it may no longer be the inarguable bargain that it was just several months ago, it's without doubt the ""champ,"" the best of breed among speakers of comparable size and function. After comparing a considerable number of personal portable speakers in the $20-$200 range, I'm almost shocked that anyone would give this magnificent little overachiever less  than five stars (the problematic battery compartment notwithstanding)."

1570646,B000W7PUMY,"G O O D.,,..T O.....T H E.....L A S T.....D R O P !!!!!","NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FROM THE 8-oz SIZE BOTTLE OF THE SAME COFFEE, SOLD BY AMAZON IN A CASE OF 2-OZ SIZES.  BUT...IT'S THE SAME COFFEE!!!!""Good To The Last Drop!"" has been Maxwell House Coffee's 'signature line' for a very long time.  And, in the case of their regular instant coffee, it holds wonderfully true, even today!  (Probably for all the rest of their coffees, as well!!!!)I truly feel for the author of the previous review.  Maxwell House has changed the jar top (at least on the 8-ounce size).  It is now YELLOW, and the top has ""Easy-To-Open"" printed in blue letterings.  I don't know if they have done the same with the two-ounce size jar-top or not.  But I do know -- after many years of drinking Maxwell House Instant Coffee....first with a red metal screw-on top (with a lovely 5-pointed white star printed on it), and then to the familiar red plastic screw-on top, (no star printed on it) -- that, despite the jar being somewhat easier to open, (it has been approved by the American Arthritis Foundation), that I sorely miss the beautiful red screw-on lids that I grew up with.  (In fact, I KEPT the last one I was able to find....but, being plastic, it cracked and broke.  So, now I must use the new, easier-to-open, yet somehow not-as-inviting yellow-with-blue-lettering jar top, if I want to buy and use Maxwell House Instant Coffee.)If the new, blue top, is on the 2 oz size as well, I hope that my mention of it can help both you, and your grandmother, to find Maxwell House Instant, if you wish to!The good news is that the Coffee inside is the same as ever!  It is not the most ""gourmet"" of coffees.....but it does have a very nice flavour, if made correctly.  (TO MAKE GOOD INSTANT COFFEE....OF ANY BRAND....THE NUMBER ONE RULE IS: BOIL THE WATER A LOT!  You simply CANNOT over-boil water that you will later pour over instant coffee!  The longer you boil the water, the better-tasting INSTANT coffee will be.  One trick I learntto make the water boil longer...yet save on gas and electricity...is this:Use a 2 or 3 quart SAUCEPAN to boil the water, NOT a tea-kettle.  Then, first, put in just enough water to cover the bottom...plus an extra ounce or two. Put the heat on high, and wait until the water STARTS to boil.(With a glass pan, you can COVER the pan and make it boil even faster, thus saving even more gas or electricity.)  When the water just STARTS TO BEGIN TO BOIL, put in a bit more water.  When that water just starts to begin to boil, add more.  And so on...until you fill the pot with the right amount of water.  You have to be careful -- especially at the beginning -- NOT to let all the water boil out, or your pot will be ruined!  But if done correctly, this not only saves power, (as the smaller amounts of water, naturally, take less power to boil), but also boils the water far more than if you just put all the water in at once!So, you get a better tasting cup of instant coffee....and also help preserve the planet, at the same time !  : )  (This method of boiling water is NOT recommended for tea, however.  Tea needs water that has been boiled, yes...but boiled as LITTLE as possible. Indeed, I have read, (in ""The Little Princesses"", by Marion Crawford, which I have also reviewed for Amazon.com -- that Queen Mary, herself, used to wait until the water for HER tea had JUST started to boil, before using it for tea.(I guess this boiling water LESS for tea, can help save natural resources, too!)The main thing I want to say, of course, is that MAXWELL HOUSE INSTANT COFFEE has a wonderful flavour, especially if you make it with REALLY boiled water!  It is the least-expensive of brand name instant coffees...and gives a nice, invitingly-flavoured cup of coffee!  If you like, you can always mix it with other, more expensive instant, (or even regular) coffees....but it's great all by itself.If you want a great tasting cup of instant coffee, yet want to save money, and yet still again, NOT buy a ""store brand"" instant coffee, then MAXWELL HOUSE INSTANT COFFEE is for you!  It is, and always has been,""Good To The Last Drop!""P.S.:  I still yearn, however, to taste Maxwell House's more varied regular ground coffees in instant form.  Please, Maxwell House...treat your instant-coffee customers to ""1897"" Coffee, and the other types of Maxwell House ground coffee, in instant form.  I predict they will all be an ""instant hit"" with customers!"

3164917,B002MZTSRM,"Back to school, creationists!","It shouldn't surprise us that the legitimate scientists interviewed, such as Dr. James Valentine of Berkeley, have since distanced themselves from the film, claiming they fully support the evolutionary explanation of the Cambrian Explosion (which lasted nearly 100 million years; not such an explosion after all).  Dr. Valentine in particular claims he had no idea the film-makers were intent on attacking evolutionary theory.In contrast, the other talking heads such as a Richard Steinberg, Stephen Myer, etc., don't have relevant PhD's in the field, and are associated with the Discovery Institute, who are single-mindedly promoting so-called Intelligent Design (although the film, deceptively, refers to it by name only once near the end).The oddest claim of the 75-minute film may be that body designs are not specified in DNA.

1724779,B000EYYBPM,A well-made and useful product.,"I installed one of these units on a COSCO ""21' World's Greatest Multi-use Ladder"" that I had purchased locally (also an excellent product).  It took about 30 minutes to install with half of that spent on reading the instructions.  A second unit could be put on in 15 minutes.The components themselves are mainly thick-walled anodized aluminum extrusions.  The leveling rack and spring are steel.  Hopefully rust will not be an issue.  All parts are well finished and packaged.LeveLok provides a nice selection of quality hardware to allow fitment to a variety of ladders.  The COSCO ladder had doublers located such that I had to grind flat edges on four of the six fender washers needed.  Not a big deal.This setup provides a very steady working platform on uneven terrain.  Adjusting the LeveLok is easy and it is also easy to move from side-to-side or remove completely when not needed.  My only complaint is that this combination is pretty heavy, but what can you expect?  The amount of time that is saved by not having to find four points in a common plane for the legs more than offsets any weight issue.Sportsman's Guide has a great price on this unit.  Their price for the whole package (bases and adjustable leg) is almost as low as anyone else's price for the bases alone.  Order two sets.  You will love the unit."

The only drawback to this set is the short liner notes and scarcity of session listings.  It will be interesting for fans of his Milestone material to compare his playing on more recent sessions with his earlier sides.

For my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. After about a week I really started wondering if it was just in my head or if I really didn't have sustain that I thought I usually got from a new pair of strings.  I convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and I was right.  I put a pair of D'Addario XL 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain I was losing with these Elixir strings.  I did feel like I could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently.  Don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of D'Addario or Ernie Ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings."

I searched the box for removal instructions; none in sight. I searched the Internet for help and struggled with the case for several hours before I got it off. When I did get it off, it left silver paint marks all over my DS. Thankfully, it comes off with a little water.CASE REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS ---------------------------------1. Pull the hinges out of their holes on each side of the DS and push the top half of the case upward and off the DS. You should have the top half off now.2. Turn the DS to the side so the power button is facing away from you. Push up on the stylus hole and push the tab holding the DS off at the same time. A corner of the DS should come out.3. Push off the rest of the tabs and the DS should come out.4. Scrub off the paint marks on your DS if any with a damp rag.-------------------------------------------------------------------------So, quick pros and cons:==PROS==+ Protects the DS from drops+ Cushy NERF foam feels great+ All ports and buttons remain accessible+ Usual aggressively-lined NERF design==CONS==- A nightmare to remove- Leaves paint marks on the DS- Adds tons of bulk- NERF is only glued onto the plastic insideA great case for someone who tends to wreck their electronics easily, and wouldn't want to take it off.

1300318,B001J1JRN0,An Excellent Practice or Small Gig Amp,"The Fender Vibro Champ is a great little amp. I'm amazed at how good this amp sounds. A small light weight package with a good set of voices that outputs a decent amount of sound.This is a 5 Watt Tube amp with enough power to fill a medium sized room or the perfect practice amp. This is a much better and louder amp than the small $100 solid state starter / practice amps by all the major manufacturers. Fender uses two very standard tubes for pre- and amplification: 12AX7 and 6V6 (both are Fender branded tubes). These are nice clean tubes that react consistently.The amp takes about 15 seconds to warm up and draws 45 Watts.The cool part of this amp is the 16 voice settings. In reality the amp packs effects for 7 different amps, Tweed, Blackface, British, Hot Rod, Metal, Jazz, and Acoustic. The first five have three different levels of style each. Our other two amps are Marshalls, an acoustic and a half stack. If I'm being really honest, I like the sound of this amp a lot more than the half stack. This is a clean simple amp to use. The Marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right.The volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched. Some voices are incredibly loud, others are really quiet. Switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot. Sadly, the volume only goes to 10.Once the voice is selected, there are 5 effects settings possible with two or three level for each (Vibratone, Delay, Reverb, Chorus, and Tremolo). The F/X level knob adjusts the amount of the effect applied (set to 1, the effect isn't used at all). This is probably the least useful part of the amp. There is no pedal selection, so once the effect is selected and volume dialed in, you're kind of stuck with that until you fiddle with the amp again. There's no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song.There is a gain knob.I like the speaker on this amp. It is nicely detailed with a good warm sound. The internal speaker is connected with a 1/4 inch jack, so it is possible to connect the amp up to another cabinet with a simple 1/4 inch speaker cable. Very nicely done Fender, most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker. The back panel also has a 1/4 inch jack Line Out.This is a great small gig or practice amp. The sound is outstanding. The amp is used with a 1983 Gibson Lucille and a 2008 Les Paul Standard Plus."

2690385,B0001GF2F6,This show is really dumb,"I watched about five minutes of the pilot. It is so poor that I could not make it longer than that. To be honest, I do not know why so many people give it great reviews. What can I say, the first person narrator seems to be rather clueless, and the bit with the frog being the one that brought death into the world because lower-case god was careless and needed a fall guy was beyond me."
3582691,B00JBBJJ24,The Snowpiercer which went nowhere.,"My interest in this film began to wane when the monologues and long soulful stares into space began.  While the initial concept of this film had possibilities, the further it progressed, the more those initial possibilities began to slip away until we were left with...nothing.So what was it all about?  Class warfare?  Dictatorship?  Survival of the fittest?  Who knows.  I think even the director lost sight of what he was attempting to portray.  As a &#34;sci-fi&#34; film, too many of the concepts applied left too many questions unanswered.  Even if we accept that the developer of &#34;the train&#34; was able to foresee the future and produce a maintenance free, world wide railway line that could withstand the harshest elements.  Even if he was able to produce a &#34;perpetual motion&#34; engine to run this train on that railway line, why did he have to rely on children of a specific size to manually &#34;grease the cogs&#34;?  I think an attempt to answer that question was hidden away in one of the lengthy monologues, but by that time I had lost all interest in trying to understand what it was all aboutOther reviewers have sung the praise of the directors efforts.  Even others have praised his previous works but &#34;canned&#34; this one.  For those who choose to follow the works of a particular director, fine.  I however, tend to watch a movie in the hope that I will be entertained, no matter who directs the work or who stars in it.  Unfortunately, in the end, (for me at least) this one fizzled."
1614160,B00338DPRG,"tastes pretty good, but . . .","Although I eat brown rice, most whole grains and avoid processed food as much as possible, I haven't converted to whole grain pasta.  I haven't eaten it in years, and I had heard that it's much improved recently.  I have mixed feelings about this linguine product.  It does taste much better than the last time I tried it, without the strong grainy quality. I have more of a problem with the texture.  While softer than the old stuff, it doesn't hold up to being tossed nearly as well as the white flour version.  In the dish I made, it fell apart into small pieces quite easily.  I notice that it also cooks quicker than the regular Barilla pasta-7 minutes as opposed to 9.  While this is far more edible than the whole wheat pasta I ate years ago, I still prefer the white flour version.  I would not buy this again."

1716692,B0009CEKY6,Bad decision,"Hi,I bought this despite the bad reviews to replace my old unit since I still have some filters left. Also the old unit worked okay for a longer time but needed to be replaced.During the installation the little chrome plastic sleeve under the mounting fell off like it was never really attached.The filter can`t handle the water pressure at my place, the water comes out above and underneath the faucet mounting ring and mixes with filtered water which is no good.I used some tape to get a better seal and now the water which still comes out underneath the ring at least does not mix with filtered water.The unit is defiantly going into the trash after I used the rest of my filters of.I am much happier with the Culligan unit when it comes to craftsmanship but I can`t say how long the filter is going to last since I just got it."

134429,B009XBCORO,Seidio's only bad product,"Ordered this case last week on the 24th (Through Seidio, not Amazon.) Came in the mail on Monday about 4pm. I was very excited for this case. However, by 6pm, I knew I'd be sending it back sadly. I'm very disappointed with Seidio over the obvious lack of research they put into this case. And it's only one minor issue that makes it so bad- the screen protector. Makes the case literally unusable.First off it's got a grid of tiny little holes across it, which show up when the phone's screen is on and are very annoying.Second, the screen protector builds up a static charge when you draw your fingers across it. Which sucks up dust and lint like no other.And lastly, they claim ""The built-in screen protector promotes touch sensitivity and clarity."" Oh, so not true! That's why I am sending this back. Scrolling applications on my phone are rendered UN- USABLE! Twitter? Facebook? Forget it, you can't register scrolls at all with this damn case. Instagram is worse, I ended up liking some pictures I didn't want to because it only recognizes solid touches.Hate to see this case go. It really does seem like it would carry the phone through the end of the world. But if I can't use the phone effectively while it's inside, Seidio didn't do their job :("
1721978,B000C010J8,Shipped well,I had reservations on having this shipped. I was afraid I would get a gloopy mess of half dry varnish in a box. The can is shipped with three metal clips that kept it sealed fine. Prying them off is an interesting chore. A narrow screwdriver and duck the projectile. Shipping was fast and secure.On the varnish: this is a good quality all purpose varnish. Used it many times and performs as expected. As a side note the gloss is very glossy finish. I knew this and was reminded after use. I mostly use a semi gloss but wanted a gloss for this project.This product is well known so the main point was that it shipped fine. Fast and secure.

1837213,B000002KNO,For the hardcore fans,"Clocking in at 31 minutes and containing maybe only 15 minutes of original material, this album seems more like a contractual obligation than a proper album that Van Halen would make, especially in their 80s heyday with Diamond Dave. Their covers of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Streets&quot; are inspired, but hardly make the entire album worthy of purchase. &quot;Little Guitars&quot; is a great Van Halen song, but not considered a classic. If you are a true Van Halen nut, or a completist, by all means buy this one, but if you're casual, stick with its predecessor &quot;Fair Warning&quot; or its follow-up, the monumental &quot;1984&quot;."
1299002,B000P5NXWM,Is It Really Worth It?,"When I purchased this I'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. Guess what?

1299454,B000VBC5CY,Amazing deal!,"I purchased this because even though I use mostly Boss effects, I also use a Behringer Hell-babe Wah. Some of the reviews mentioned that Boss effects fit perfectly and that there is a 'footprint' for a wah type effect. I must say thanks to those reviewers! The only issue I have is that I'm kinda slow, so it took me a while to realize that I had to unscrew a part of the actual board in order for the wah to sit comfortably. I was also a little bit apprehensive about using the supplied adapter with all of my pedals in case there was some sort of conflict, but so far it has been a perfect experience! This is such a sturdy board. I must say though, that I had no idea it would be so huge! This is a perfect addition to any serious rig. UPDATE 21/6/10: I've finally filled all the available slots with the addition of the Boss Phase Shifter. So far this board has performed superbly! Yes, there is some noise (as there always is when using overdrive/distortion pedals), but no more than is to be expected. I use a Boss Noise Suppressor (Sorry if this is beginning to look like a Boss ad) and it works perfectly!"

My dog doesn't like to wear it but does so because there is no &#34;Big Walk&#34; unless he does.  Wherever I walk him when he has the cap on, people stop, get out their cell phones and snap photos of him.  One woman said, &#34;I'm tempted to get a dog just so he/she could wear that cap!&#34;The cap has a thin terrycloth type lining inside the part that sits on the very top of the dog's head.  I ordered a &#34;Small&#34; and it's so adjustable it's the proper size."

3758902,B0059HJFU0,Works well,I did not know how big the tubes were untill I got it out of the box. I was thinking of using this to suck out fluids from my car like steering fluid and brake fluid but the tube was too big for it to fit in the over flow. I was able to Jimmy-Rig it to work. It takes a few pumps for it to start working but does a good job keeping it from going back in where it came from. I did have to flip it up-side-down in order for the remaining fluid to get pumped all the way through it. I was not sure how to clean it out so I pumped some degreaser through it to hopefully get some of the oil out. Feels fairly strong for the price.Don't let the picture fool you it is fairly big

1626820,B0041NYV8E,Far too spicy,"I was anxious to try this item because I hoped the ginger would help quell my morning sickness.  The packet directions stated to mix the entire package with 250ml of water, or approximately 8.45 oz.  I used hot water and mixed up the drink.  I was a little nervous to try it, as it looked like muddy river water. The first sip wasn't so bad.  The lemon taste was nice, and not artificial tasting.  The ginger taste was ok at first, but left a ""hot"" after taste in my mouth.  The drink was very strong, so I poured the drink back into the water bottle that I had gotten the water out of, to ""water it down"" so that it wouldn't be so strong.  That improved it slightly, but the after taste of the ginger was still too hot for my taste.  Finally, I decided to put the bottle into the fridge to see if I would like it better cold.  Two hours later I pulled it out and shook it up (It still looked like river water to me)  and took a drink.  This time, the lemon flavor, which had been pleasant before, was completely overpowered by the ginger taste, which seemed to be even more ""hot"" and lasting than before.Needless to say, I did not finish the bottle, and I have no intention of buying more of this.  I felt that the lemon flavor was nice, and perhaps a ""plain"" lemon drink would be fine, but the ginger in this beverage was far to spicy for my taste.  I have no idea if this beverage would be beneficial for those suffering with nausea, because I was unable to finish one package.  In my opinion, it would only aggreavate the stomach of someone who is already feeling ill."

1873090,B000E0OEQC,Don't See the World Through Someone Else's Eyes,"Celebrity children have gotten a bad rap lately thanks to the reality exploits from the likes of Nicole Richie and the Osborne children. Most seem content on living off their parent names as opposed to making a name of their own on their own talents. Then there is Robin Thicke who not only didn't use his dad Allen's name (you may know better as Dr. Jason Seaver) to get famous, he even picked music over acting like his father, well after a few guest spots on his dad's show as well as The Wonder Years. Thicke stuck out his first time around back in 2002 despite the catchy, Mozart sampling When I Get You Alone. But don't feel to bad for him, he does have a Grammy for songwriting and has written songs for Christina Aguilera and Usher. But now he's back with a new look, a new label (Pharrell's Star Trak), and a new album, The Evolution of Robin Thicke.The album sounds like a history of soul music as Thicke draws on some the best. Got 2 Be Down is his Marvin Gaye song; Complicated is his take on Smokey Robinson; 2 the Sky is could be a Donny Hathaway song; Cocaine would have fit well on Curtis Mayfield's Superfly Soundtrack; Lonely World could have been from Stevie Wonder's 70'era. And Thicke turning ""to"" into ""2"" and ""you"" into ""U"" in his songs is straight out of Prince's playbook. With all the decent blue-eyed soul, you have to imagine Justin Timberlake is listening to the album wishing he wrote songs like Would That Make U Love Me and Can U Believe because this is album JT wishes he could make.Faith Evans helps elevate the fun opening track Got to B Down, but the other guest spots don't fair as well. One of the worst rapper in recent years, Lil Wayne, who goes by the even cheesier moniker Weezy, brings down the worst being All Night Long. Shooter, which is a reworking of a song on Thicke's debut for Weezy's Tha Cater, vol. 2 album which is somewhat catchy, but still not a good as the original. Pharrell continues his lackluster year with the production on the formulaic Wanna Love U Girl and throws in an anemic rap for good measure. Length is also an issue at over seventy minutes, had Thicke trimmed some of the fat, you may have been able to listen through the whole album without skipping a song."
3682274,B002ZMFM4A,Love these thermometers!!!,"These are the first thermometers I have found that I can actually read with my bifocals on!

1374424,B000FRU0NU,TIME TO SELL,"If you are a victim of too much hype ... just like me who mistakenly bought this game cause Microsoft spend millions on too mush fake hype then sell it before it's worth pennies.--------------------Previously I wrote:--------------------First to let you know about myself so you don't think I am biased .... I am XBOX and Microsoft fan. I've been playing games for last 22 years so you can imagine I have gone through many generations of video gaming. I myself is IT Systems Architect.I played this game for hours yesterday before coming to conclusion. Honestly I bought this game because of too much Hype ... but all my expectations were broken yesterday.The Halo3 gameplay is average nothing special. No special fighting moves or movements just simple FPS. The Graphics are below average when you compare them with the graphics of Gears of War, BioShock, MassEffect, or Timeshift. There was a hype about no frame drop ... that is completely false ... there are frame drops and any body can notice it.It is completely unbelievable that all the editorial critics said that they have never played such a fantastic game. Either Microsoft filled their mouth with a lot of money or they are also nothing more than hyped critics.Lets see how much of $10 million fake hype can take this game to."
2484095,B00005JLBQ,MIddle America,THis was well acted drama. well look at the cast! Not for kids. an adult movie. 1930's I liked the old cars :) Had a gangster theme but not bonny and clyde. Just enjoy it. I kept it to watch again some day.
1463763,B003O6JKLC,4gig 360 S,"The new design is incredible. The look, size, just everything is great. For all the people that say ""its just as hot if not hotter than the regular 360"" Well DUH it is on a single die. That heat sink is going to heat up with the same amount of heat as the old 360.. just on a single die instead of two. BUT it still runs cooler even tho it seems hot. Unless you do a real heat test you cannot say it really does run hotter... because it does NOT. It almost runs 10c cooler sometimes.New touch design I do like (even the little beeps it gives you :D ) I really like how they put the fan on the side making air come in from the top and out of the side, way better design (you don't have to worry about it being against the wall anymore)I like the 4gig better because it is matte, I had a 250gig and sold it because I did not enjoy the dust, prints, etc it attracted. I do believe that spending $40 more for a 4gig and buying a 250gig HDD separate is the way to go.Of course no Blu-Ray even tho that would be great since that the reason I own a PS3, but thats Sony not MS. Its not going to happen although we wish it would.I think the controller that comes with the console is actually more 'better' (bad grammar on purpose) I just like the D-Pad it feels to me that they have change it some. And I like how the battery packs actually fit well in the controller now and the new Chrome guide button.Built in wifi is a no duh, why didn't they do that in the beginning... But is great and its N band.Only negatives.. the power supply now has a fan in it, it is louder than the console itself if the game you are playing is installed on the hard drive. BUT that is not a bad thing really because the PSU needs a good fan. And that is just nit pic (my PC and PS3 are just as loud if not louder)Great console wish they would have started out with this good of a console from the start."
3633657,B000KL58M4,horrible,"tried this over our regular brand and noticed the whole room started smelling like ammonia. We have not done anything differently, kept the normal changing litter schedule etc. It has horrible oder control and also tracks through the house a lot more than our regular litter. I hate to say what our regular litter is as I do not want to sound like a plug for that brand but it is scoop away and its perfect. Does not track all over the place and excellent odor contorl."

Finally got her to eat a whole one, and w/in a couple of weeks, I noticed worms again.  Took her to the vet who told me the OTC products don't really work that well.  I'll take her to the vet again next time and not bother w/these or other OTCs."

1303976,B00J4TBMVO,"These sound great on some guitars, not so great on others...","I have reviewed these strings before, and frankly, I wasn't all that impressed with the tone the first time around. I think they feel great on the fingertips and they're very playable, especially for a picker, but I just wasn't sold on the tone. To be fair, I only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars, and found them lacking. There seemed to be a drop-ff in tone when switching from my usual strings (Martin SPs) to these.So this time, I decided to try them on a much smaller guitar. I have a Yairi Alvarez AY-20, which is a 000 sized guitar, and they sound terrific. I'm no engineer or physicist, so I really can't explain the mechanics of it all, but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body, and they produce a very clear, bright tone across the higher range, and hold their own on the low range.I still don't think they're the best thing since sliced bread, and I still think they're a bit overpriced, but I have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than I would expect. This seems to have no effect on the tone, but for what these cost, you'd think the coating would last a lot longer than two months (I play daily for at least 30 minutes a day).Overall, these are good (but overpriced) strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars. You'll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them, and which don't. In my experience, large body guitars lose tone, but they sound great on a smaller body."
1469811,B0041HROGG,The paint wears off,"Note: I don't have one of these, but I do have the silver controllers that come with the Halo: Reach special edition console. The silver paint looks great, until it wears off, at which point it looks really tacky. In my case almost all of the wear is on the bottom so I don't see it much, but still, controllers whose color is provided by using plastic that color don't have this problem. If you don't use it much this may not be a problem for you, but if you do, just be aware this isn't going to look as cool as it does in the picture after several months of use."
159778,B00CDWTQD0,Really nice,"I've never used matte screen protectors before and I really like these ones. They arrived days before and I like that about a company. They definitely would get more than 5 stars if possible.What I didn't like and don't mind at all as that it doesn't actually fit the whole screen itself. At the top there is a little gap (no big deal), most people would probably complain, but again I'm fine with it and it does work in well in direct sunlight well with the HTC One."
1491233,B0050SZ0SY,"Stunning to play and look at, seems a bit on the short side.","This is a fun game to play with great graphics, great controls and a decent story. My one problem is that it does seem on the short side to me although I do play much more than most people do at this point in time. I think Far Cry 3 is a much more in depth game than this one as far as length and things to do outside the main storyline. If we are just judging by cost to amount of novel game play experiences then FC3 beats this easily. So it's recommended at used prices not new. It does seem to scale pretty nicely to those of us who don't have the latest systems as mine is a few years old with my graphics card being about 3 years old. It ran OK on the games auto settings but I turned that down to medium levels and a lower resolution than my monitor to get a more fluid experience."

In the early 90s, Korn puts out their first album, which is admittedly pretty damn good.  Was it really necessary to milk the concept of no guitar riffs, unimaginative and totally childish lyrics, total lack of talent to such a degree that we end of with Meterora from Linkin Park?  This is the downfall right here folks, kids are praying for it more than anyone apparently.  Linkin Park is just terrible, how can you not see that kids.

3035416,B0015AOBOA,Not the greatest presentation of this fine series,"I read up on this product before purchasing on Amazon, as I am an ardent Blondie-phile. I taped most of the series on VHS when shown on various networks about twenty five years ago. When one of the tapes recently came unwound I decided to purchase this set.  I had read various reviews of this stating that the sequencing was off somewhat and that these DVDs were recorded from VHS versions. They are not the movies released by Columbia, they are recorded from the versions released by television. It was also stated that many people found this problem with the pacing irritating, (by the pacing it means that the film may slow somewhat - it's not playing at normal speed). Also the soundtrack was a little creaky as well. I played the first Blondie episode from this set and found the pacing problem very irritating. I have much better quality in my VHS tapes. The second and third episodes that I played from this set weren't as bad as the first, but, there were some pacing problems as well. However, I can live with it as I really love this series. Wish that Columbia would release a REAL version DVD set from their master copies. THAT would probably be superb. Buy this set if you are a true Blondie-phile but be prepared to be irritated."

This particular drink is one of, if not the worst I've ever tried! It's so sweet that you will wince while swallowing this stuff. It also has a terrible taste(whatever flavor it is?)that will not leave you wanting more, but will leave a ""I can't wait until it's over"" sensation. If you want a good one that doesn't effect your stomach(like me, if I drink three cups of coffe, my stomach is wrenched!) try Celcius, it's very low carb and doesn't make you run out of gas.

1415986,B001CP0Q8S,"Completely unnecessary, and potentially harmful","Ever since Microsoft approved the shoddily-made Xbox 360, which is infamously prone to overheating, it opened the door wide open for third party peripheral makers to release all manner of ""system cooling"" peripherals that do absolutely nothing at all. Do not be fooled, these devices will not make your system any less prone to failureand the only console that has an overheating problem is the Xbox 360.The PS3 and Wii are perfectly designed for expelling heat already, so the only thing that these ""external cooling units"" do is wear out the system's internal fans faster, and the same goes for the Xbox 360 (and there is no proof anywhere that these external cooling units make the Xbox 360 less prone to overheating/RRODing).

1855327,B00004YTWH,"Underrated album, underrated talents.","Trumpeter Kenny Dorham, tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, and pianist Kenny Drew all have one thing in common, they spent their careers in the shadows of bigger name musicians such as Gillespie, Rollins, and Kelly that obscured their individual talent. The material recorded here, all originals penned by Dorham, allows these men the opprotunity to stand in their own light and swing out. Rounding out this classic 1961 session are two men who cast long shadows themselves, the rock solid duo of the thunderous drummer Philly Joe Jones and bassist Paul Chambers. Highlights of the album include &quot;Sunset&quot; which features laidback, simmering solos by Mobley, Drew, and a muted Dorham, as well as the hard swinging &quot;Philly Twist&quot; and the title track &quot;Whistle Stop&quot;. The sound is wonderfully remastered as usual by Mr Rudy Van Gelder, which just adds to this underrated gem. This cd is perfect for fans of classic Blue Note hard bop as well as fans of Dorham, Mobley, Drew, Chambers, and Jones, and is highly recommeded by this listener."
3695086,B003YCUDVW,Worked like a charm for my cats,"I used a pill a day for a couple days on my cats after a flea bath and moving to a flea-free environment and the fleas didn't return. I call it a success. No adverse side effects for my kitties either. They are about 9 lbs each, I actually used half a pill on one and it still kept the fleas away, so you could stretch the pills even further with small cats and dogs. I was very pleased, the pricing is unbeatable for comparable products/brands. Having no fleas in the house is a big part of the equation, so don't forget to vacuum, vacuum, vacuum and launder all blankets and beds...set off a flea bomb if necessary and / or steam clean furniture to remove all eggs. Daily vacuuming for at least seven days will break the flea cycle and remove them from you home if your pets are not harboring them. So use this pill while cleaning your home to rid yourself of any infestation."
1608789,B002JWZVJW,Good alternative,"I tried the Coconut Water with a splash of passion fruit but I honestly could taste nothing but passion fruit. It is a pretty good flavor though, so I didn't mind. It's slightly sweet yet still refreshing especially when you drink it cooled or iced. This product is supposedly high in electrolytes which makes it an ideal post-workout drink. When you compare the ingredients in this coconut water to the ones in Powerade for example it really is a no brainer. Coconut Water consists of these ingredients: Coconut Water, Passion Fruit Puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor. While these aren't perfectly unprocessed ingredients it sounds much better than the Powerade ingredient list which contains high fructose corn syrup, red 40, blue 1, natural and artificial flavors, calcium disodium  EDTA (to protect color)- to name just a few. Overall, I would definitely try this again although I think I would prefer the plain coconut water over the flavored kinds."
1885615,B00DYWKPAQ,Mechanical Bull - First impressions...,"King of leon are one of the more distinctive bands to come up in the past 10 years. Starting off their career with the raunchy and garagey, and energetic Youth and Young Manhood and have gradually matured their sound. Losing some fans along the way, and gaining tons of others. They reached the pinnacle of their success with the worldwide hit ""Sex on Fire"". Which was in itself a very polarizing song for longtime fans. Their characteristically quirky and spastic sound cooled down even more in 2010's Come Around Sundown, showcasing an expansive and mid-tempo style that was pleasant but failed to impress.Their brand new album Mechanical Bull, seems to be taking more queues from the latest two albums rather than their earlier garage sound. I'm sure fans of the early KoL who still haven't given up will give this a listen and will, yet again, be disappointed. The group seems unapoloteic about their new polished and radio-friendly direction. But if you have come to this album with open ears and few preconceived ideas you are bound to find a great rock'n'roll album, well-balanced in ballads, rock anthems, and quirky garage-influenced tracks.Mechanical Bull will not rake in any new fans who haven't gotten on board since Sex on Fire blew up on the radiowaves, yet, it will provide with sufficient ear candy for mainstream music apprecioators and unprejudicial rock fans. If you are still searching for the lo-fi and hard-punching Kings I'm afraid to inform you those days are well behind them."

337243,B001KND9FE,Not Great,"I got a sample of these from my ortho, and it seemed like such a great thing that I ordered this package right away for when I ran out.Here are my gripes:1. The floss gives so much that it's hard to get it between teeth. The string is not tight enough to maneuver well.2. If you have brackets really close together, this will NOT work at all in those areas. You will need to find another solution.3. The teeth I am able to use these on, do not feel better after I'm done. It feels like I'm pushing food up in-between the teeth, rather than getting it out. Maybe that's because the design prevents you from moving the floss string around much to thoroughly clean between the teeth.I gave these a chance, but just really don't like them. I wanted to try everything, so I also ordered floss-threaders, and I ordered threaded floss. My favorite product, hands down is the threaded floss (Not the floss-threaders). I can thread it between my teeth above the brackets, really get in there and floss thoroughly, then easily maneuver it out behind the wire. I ordered two different brands and they both work really well.I gave these two stars instead of just one, because despite the drawbacks it is a novel idea that might work for some people. So if you have used the platypus and like them, great. If you've tried them but want something different for your braces, I highly recommend trying the threader floss."
1849767,B00000IAU3,Absolutely phenomenal...,"No Angel by Dido is absolutely incredible.  It's one of those albums that you can buy and listen to a million times and never get tired of it.  Dido has this interesting sort of talent.  She doesn't have to push her voice or do dance music to get her point across.  She just uses her talent and light music to back her up.  Let me tell you, that really works for her.I can't believe that without Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot; this album probably wouldn't have been as big of a hit as it has ended up being.  It's absolutely an album that no one should miss, yet without him (despite the fact that I dislike him a lot) this album would've been missed by too many people.  The world could've lost out on such an incredible talent if she hadn't had her song sampled on one of his tracks.This album is very smart and classy, and so is anyone who buys this album because it shows that they're okay with making a mature decision."
1623323,B003XDH6M6,"Good quality licorice, but the Pomegranate flavor is not for me!","I was excited to try these and when they arrived in the mail I opened the package, closed my eyes and got a whiff of an almost medicinal smell.  The weather is quite hot now, and the package was warm when I opened it so that might have contributed to the smell. The texture was quite nice, chewy, not hard. The taste, however, did not appeal to me and the licorice did have an aftertaste that I did not care for.I liked the packaging, the size of the licorice, and the amount contained within the package - I just did not care for the Pomegranate flavor and would like to try some of the other ones available.I also wish it was made in the USA instead of Mexico, but I have to think that because of the reputation of Newman's Own products that it is being made under the strictest of regulations. That being said, I still wish it was made in the USA.  I was surprised to see that it wasn't when I looked at the packaging."

1719591,B000BJJY5M,"High cost, high reward","After struggling to make precision rabbets on plywood, I set about looking for an undersized rabbeting bit set (as most people are aware, 1/4"" ply isn't really 1/4"", nor is 3/4"" really 3/4"") and I'm too impatient to fiddle with a shop jig. I couldn't find any except for this set and an Amana set, both about the same price. I decided to buy this one since it came with a full set of undersized rabbet bits as well as every other conceivable size I could ask for. The price is steep - about half the price of my router! But the cuts are really nice. I practiced on some scrap wood and then cut the real thing and they really are perfectly sized. I'll never have to worry about rabbeting again.I agree with the prior review that the bit itself is huge. You'll need a full sized router to run this and be sure to keep it on a slower speed. The router by itself is one of the more dangerous shop tools and with this thing attached it's downright deadly. Make sure everything is fully secure before turning it on. Also be really sure that the bit can spin within the router base without touching the sides of the opening. When I inserted this, I noticed that my base plate was slightly off and the bit hit up against it as I spun the bit with my fingers (with the router unplugged of course), so I had to tweak the base to fit the bit. Another downside is the bit doesn't fit with the vacuum attachment so I'm back to sweeping up router shreds again.The allen wrench and bearings that remove and secure the templates are tiny. I can envision these getting lost. Never fear -- the bag has the part number just in case you lose it. And I'm pretty sure I will.Four stars because for the life of me I don't know why the bit is this large. As a result, a lot of care has to be taken to ensure safe and proper operation (setting the base plate, low speed, can't' use the vacuum hose). But if you've got a big enough router and take caution, you'll find a really good set of rabbeting bits that will last a very long time with precision accuracy. I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend the set."
1560806,B000ILK9PM,NOT All-Natural,"This is NOT natural. The taste is fine if you like chemicals, but I don't know where the company gets off advertising as all-natural and thus it pops up (so to speak) on Amazon searches for all-natural popcorn seasonings, when all of their products contain unnatural ingredients. This does matter, because my immune system has failed due to the impact of chemicals on my body, and my doctor has ordered me to remove all preservatives and chemicals from my food wherever possible, trying to control the rampant inflammation and reduce the effects. But like many people, I still crave snacks, so I pop my own popcorn or make my own snacks, and seasonings make this easier. But Kernel Seasons, while tasty and convenient junk, is still junk. I will have to keep looking elsewhere for something that makes my snacks easy to prepare, and tasty enough that I don't miss chemicals."
3138432,B0026ZQJP2,"Fascinating, but a bit confusing film noir","You have to be patient... this movie is almost perfect, but the first 30 minutes definitely need better editing. I have read in a TV magazine that Michael North, intended to figure as the male lead, wasn't convincing, so that the studio reduced his part considerably. You may see this in the first 30 minutes which are extremely confusing and over-constructed. Persons appear, disappear, do mysterious things, reappear, seem to commit suicide, seem to be murdered, seem to be killed by accident, seem to suffer amnesia and to have forgotten that they are married... it is a thoroughly directed, very atmospheric, but somehow crude picture which is much too mysterious, even for a mystery thriller. It is almost impossible to identify with one of the persons or to follow one of the subplots before the switch of the switch of the switch makes the film shift to a completely new subplot...But be patient, it's worth it, and the last two thirds are excellent. It gets quite clear that much is a fake in a witty, very clever and sometimes perverse attempt of radio announcer Claude Rains to murder those who are in his way - therefore, Michael North has to play a false role himself in order to discover the truth. This, of course, will be very dangerous for him and for a girl he falls in love with. What you will see is a clever film noir of dense atmosphere with an outstanding Claude Rains as the villain (which he does with the same sardonic aplomb as in ""Deception"") who is the unofficial lead. Mike Curtiz' direction is on the top of his art. Much suspense, long shadows, superimpositions, mirrors, elegant camera movements, long, dark bars, strange camera angles focusing menacing objects (such as a glass with poisoned Champaign), significant close-ups, vivid action, many thrilling moments, and the murders / attempted murders of Rains are as clever as those in the ""Columbo"" series. The picture is even more than perfect entertainment - it may be remarkable that it mixes plot and message, for many things explain how deception really works. Rains is the author and host of a murder mystery radio show - by talking about things people are interested in, he tells the truth (murderers may look like anyone else), but makes the audition keep a certain distance. We want to suspect someone of a murder by our general curiosity, and Rains gives us what we want, thus detracting from the fact that he himself is the greatest murderer of them all. His plans are executed by means of acoustics, such as edited and thereby misleading tapings of conversations. This does not only illustrate how the media work and how we all may be deceived by allegedly ""objective"" evidence, but this makes Rains' attacks even more dangerous: Means of acoustics are those of the radio, Rains' natural domain in which he is an expert of manipulation (of the masses, i.e. us, and the other characters in this movie).The end is not to be spoiled, but Rains even uses his radio show to fulfil a last act of vanity. One has the impression that he is only living in the eye and in the ear of the other. Therefore, this picture is not only a thrilling film noir, but tells also a story about people with an empty life, suffering from complete other-directedness. Not to be watched and heard by the other is not to be. Revealing all the perverse consequences of this modern disease makes ""The Unsuspected"" as subversive as later films such as ""Peeping Tom"" (1960), which has become a classic on voyeurism. But ""The Unsuspected"" is nevertheless great entertainment - at least in the last two thirds."
1472766,B00499A3P0,Be Very Afraid,"But try not to climb all the way up on the videogame fear scale because the upcoming Dark Souls (to be released toward the end of 2011) promises to be a lot more intense. Anyone who is into action RPGs and hasn't played DS yet should use the next few months to remedy the situation and... get hurt a little. Or a lot.INTRODUCTION - SETTING THE MOODHey, I apologize in advance for the super-long review but this is an immense game so maybe it deserves a long review. I'll see if I can abbreviate it a little but I'm afraid it will stay 'long' no matter what I do.Hmmm... I worked so hard to bring my beloved Uchigatana to a +6 but now Ben, Bladwin's brother - they are both blacksmiths - suggests that I give it to him and he's going to make a Crescent Uchigatana +1 out of it. A PLUS ONE out of my +6? Yes, my kids advise, go for it. While it's true that the Plus One Crescent does only 75 damage vs. my +6's 153, my current level of magic 35 should add at least 92 points of magic attack to the physical damage and, with the help of a few dozen Darkmoon stones (lots of Grim Reapers had to die for me to harvest them) and less than 10,000 souls (a bargain) I can immediately upgrade it to Crescent +3 and with THAT weapon, my friends, it only takes one quick slash to dispose of a silver skeleton and I can do away more than half a dozen low-level zombies with one swing. And, did I mention that it will slowly restore my MP (magic points) while I'm wearing it so I don't really need to keep the Fragrant Ring on and I could use the Sharp Magic ring instead to further boosts my magic strengths including Uchigatana's power but, true, it WILL lower my magic defenses. Or use the Thieves' Ring while in Queen's Tower prison so that the lovely bell-ringing octopus-head prison guards (good looking girls with a passion for electrocuting and stabbing while hugging you tight) won't notice me. And the Thieves' Ring seems to do well with those giant flying stingrays. They do notice me eventually but it makes them less vigilant so there are fewer of those 15-foot long, self-homing spikes they keep shooting at me when they get angry or suspicious.Did I say too much? Then, let me say this. Granted, I'm a slow player because I really like to enjoy my games so maybe this is not typical but, after some 400 hours of play, Yesssss... got my Platinum - my only so far and, until maybe until Elder Scrolls V comes around, likely to stay this way.BRIEFLYDemon's Souls is, in my view, one of the best action fantasy RPGs that ever came to a game console. If you don't mind stabbing, slashing, shooting, cleaving, crushing, tearing, punching, scratching, infecting, slicing, burning or poisoning your enemies (and have the same thing done to you) and watching them die as they bleed, scream, decompose and sometimes howl in agony or even beg for mercy. And you'll be facing several classes of zombies, gargoyles, giant flying stingrays, knights in shining or all-black armors swinging what you could safely call 'weapons of mass destrctions' in the shape of ten-foot long meat cleavers at you, leeches, rats, blobs with shields on top of them, daemons of all shapes an sizes, grim rippers, octopus-headed ladies, immensely powerful fire-breathing dragons, giant steel spiders, huge worms with human faces.Coming from someone who's played the Ultima series way back in the 80's and who's still waiting for the next in the Scrolls of the Elders, having enjoyed Oblivion more than any other console RPG, saying that Demon's Souls is 'awesome' should mean something. But, I was trying to briefly describe the game so, here it is, the story line in a paragraph, as dark and impossibly complicated as it could possibly come out of Japan. A king attempts to keep his kingdom - Boletaria - prosperous by means of some dark rituals involving the consumption of souls which, eventually, awakens the Old One, a great demon whose awakening unleashes lesser but still immensely powerful demons who quickly begin feasting on the regular people souls themselves while the kingdom is enveloped by a mysterious fog, isolating it from the rest of the world. None but one who went into the fog ever returned and that one told the story - everyone in Boletaria is now insane and, unless someone does something, the fog is likely to spread and envelop the entire world. And that's where you, the player, get involved so your mission is to talk the Old One into going back to sleep and maybe save the world.MY EVALUATIONIt's strange how a game that's so unforgiving and that requires you to fight so many battles again and again until you achieve perfection - only to have to fight them some more - can become so addictive and almost obsessively so. There are three gamers in our family and not only do we wait for our turns but we watch each other playing, share 'funny stories' and tips involving gameplay and lose a lot of sleep when we can afford it and sometimes when we can't. It's probably illogical but, having to fight the same battles many times is not only immersive but it's actually fun and rewarding. On the third or fourth try you know exactly how to defeat the Grim Reaper and you know each individual Gargoyle's style and capabilities and you can play each battle in many different ways by slightly changing your tactics and strategies and the weapons you use until you achieve the perfect stab or slash or cast your spell at the time and place needed for it to hit the mark and to maximum damage. The only thing... before you get to the Grim Reaper you must first annihilate a few dozen other enemies, every single time.And did I mention that that worlds of Boletaria are simply Awesome? Exploration and discovery are a joy in this game only balanced by the overwhelming sense of fear, dread and desolation oozing out of it. Most of your enemies don't only die when you dispose of them, but they go screaming, screeching or howling. Their bodies bleed and, through the controller, you can almost feel the the flesh tearing apart or stabbed by your blade or their armor breaking into pieces.Being so hard to master - but not impossible because I won't consider myself a great player - there is a great sense of accomplishment every time a new boss is defeated, a weapon is upgraded and tried out in the field or a new location is conquered.I can't give too much praise to the online play elements. You are NEVER alone in Demon's Souls. Other players can watch you and you can see their ghostly outlines as they play. You can leave messages to warn others of dangers and... you can see how they die or sometimes commit suicide. You can help others and sometimes you must defend yourself from those attempting to invade your world and destroy you. And all is smooth and so well integrated into the game's atmosphere that, in the rare occasions when our PS3 loses its network, all seems disturbingly quiet and lonely.While nothing is perfect and nothing can be perfect and without having finished the game yet, I would say that Demon's Souls is without a doubt a top RPG for the PS3 platform.GAMESPACEYou act in 5 'worlds' or locations:  the Boletarian Palace, the Stonefang Tunnel, the Tower of Latria, the Shrine of Storms and the Valley of Defilement and you can cross from one world into another via the Nexus, a safe space, to the extent that anything built on top of the Old One can be safe, where you do most housekeeping chores. You can move relatively freely inside each world to the extent that you don't mind fighting... everybody all the time and there are gates that take you farther (usually deeper) into the worlds IF you manage to defeat the bosses guarding them.Along the way, and usually following a fight, you find weapons and armor or items that may help you upgrade your weapons or armor and you decide how to manage your possessions but the main currency in the worlds of Boletaria is now 'souls'. Everyone is after them and the only way you can survive is to get them, usually by killing your opponents and to spend them on things that you need.But this is only scratching the surface. Your eventual goal is to calm down the Old One by defeating and killing the demons that feed him souls and, as expected, this is not exactly a walk in the woods. How about a walk in swamps infested by some of the most foul and poisonous and or disease spreading critters you could never imagine? Or exploring deep and dark tunnels where ghosts and Grim Reapers live, or some immense prison where all have lost their minds and the warden ladies wear tentacles on their heads? Or a mine where... you guessed it right, everyone is insane and they keep acting as if they were working but they will always take a break so that they can chase you around, throw some fireballs at you or drop boulders the size of trucks on you? And if you think that the 'surface' is safer, think huge dragons capable of completely incinerating your with one casual sneeze, or armored and well-armed skeletons always in a bad mood.GAMEPLAYAfter you create your character - name, gender, class, looks - you start with very little but, as you gather souls, you pay the blind lady who doesn't look like much but almost everything here is deceiving and she will raise your soul level, allowing you to improve on ability: vitality, endurance, strength, intelligence, magic, faith, dexterity, luck and you will need these abilities to be able to cast spells use certain weapons and generally survive in a world in which there are very few you could call 'friends'.You progress by improving yourself and your weapons and defeating the various bosses. Doing so is important because the bosses block access to areas where... the next boss can be found.Once you get killed, something that happens often, you lose the souls that you accumulated and wake up in the Nexus in 'soul form'. And there are ways to regain your body, usually by defeating a boss or... HELPING someone else defeat a boss but acting in human form must be a well-thought decisions. You do have more 'health points' as a 'body' but you are also weaker and while in a body form your world is open to invasion from other players out there. They can show up and kill you and, every time you die (or when you do bad things) the world you died in turns a little 'darker'. And the darker the world, the tougher your opponents become and... you are more likely to find 'good stuff'.While in 'soul' form, you can volunteer to help other players defeat bosses or simply ride along with them. The reward is that you are revived in body form if, when summoned, you help the other player defeat a boss or maybe defeat an invader who teleported into his world to kill him.Now, just to make it all a lot more fun, while you are online, the makers of Demon's Souls have the ability to control the so-called 'world tendency' in each of the five worlds, independently of your own actions so a pure-white world may suddenly turn darker and more dangerous or vice-versa.And this is not all. While playing, you can see the 'blood stains' of the heroes who died on that particular spot. You touch it and you see the last seconds that preceded that hero's death. And you can leave messages to warn others and, you can see in real time, the ghostly images of other players fighting monsters or just running around as you are minding your own business.And, of course, every time you leave a world for the safety of the Nexus, ALMOST everything other than the bosses and some of the NPCs resets and respawns. So you will be fighting the same battles over and over and over again, using different tactocs, improving your skills until you approach perfection and achieve elegance.And... how about whole the game resetting itself? It's true, or so I heard that, after you complete the game you can retain some of your hard-earned possessions and skills and go for an 'encore' but a bit harder this time.THE PAIN FACTORThis is one of the most brutal and unforgiving games I've ever played. And I'm not talking about the slaying of zombies or slimy creatures at almost every turn and having to do it repeatedly. Demon's Souls is unforgiving to the player because nothing but complete dedication and near-perfection would do.The tutorial is probably the threshold that's the hardest to cross. You start weak and almost unarmed and you mission is not only to survive - which, if you are successful, you won't - but also to defeat a mysterious monster that's almost nothing but slime, near-impenetrable armor and dozens of extra-long spears and do it in near-complete darkness. Saying that it's frustrating it's an understatement. I would have given up if it weren't for my kids who won their first victory before I did and motivated me to continue.And the hardship continues and only grows after that. Unlike most other games, you can't just save once you defeat an opponent and establish a safe point to restart from. You are in that world until you are killed and lose your hard-earned souls or you return to the Nexus on your own but, remember, every time you come back from the Nexus, all the monsters you killed except for the bosses are there challenging you again and you have to kill them again. But, not everything resets itself completely. Usually 'the good stuff' only presents to you once or twice, IF you are lucky but the bad guys are always there to challenge you again and, if the world turns dark on you, to maybe slice you and dice you a few times before you develop some new and better tactics to defeat them for the 100th time again.VIOLENCEI believe I mentioned this all throughout my review but maybe the level of violence merits its own heading. There is A LOT of it in this game and all of it is graphic. I believe there is a setting that would hide 'bleeding' but with or without that, there was a reason it was rated 'M' as in 'mature'. So, anyone who doesn't feel comfortable about killing tens of thousands of soulless, computer generated creatures, don't buy this game.TECHNICAL MERITDemon's Souls was made for the PS3 exclusively and it shows. The graphics and animations are simply breathtaking and, unlike the multi-platform Oblivion where 'fire' and 'smoke' could only be done at the expense of slowing everything to a crawl and the objects in the the distance became usually blurred, the world of Demon's Souls is almost always crisp and responsive visually, it rarely skips a frame and it never slows down, even when dozens of characters are present and moving independently on the screen.Add to the above some of the most realistic sound effects and 'break and shatter' graphics, with the audio-visual experience enhanced by the controller perfectly synchronize vibrations that allow you to 'feel' the blows as your shield blocks them.Unlike many other RPG worlds where a lot of the landscape and the dungeons are cookie-cutter reassemblies of a limited number of elements, the world of Boletaria appears to be fully, uniquely custom-designed. Very little repeats and every new location you discover is different and usually surprisingly different from anything else in the game.THE BONUSESThe art of DS is just as awesome as the game overall. Full art book scans can be found online but I'd go for the real thing if spending a few extra dollars wasn't an issue because it's all so awesome, in a dramatic, terrifying way. The music is less original but, since this edition can now be bought for less than the bare game was selling at launch time, this is a worthy package.FIVE STARSOn a 1-100 scale, I would rate Demon's Souls as a 95+. The game is remarkably bug free and the instances where characters do silly things because they can't climb a boulder or can't make a turn are rare enough for the game to stay immersive. I already know that I'll be spending more hours on Demon's Souls than on any other PS3 RPG or any other type of games I own so far.At this price and considering the added CD, this is as most compelling buy.____________________________________________________NOTE:- There's a lot of info and a thriving community on a dedicated Wiki site.

1831291,B0000028RR,Music as forceful and uncompromising  as the cover art.,"From the beginning in 1992, Rage Against The Machine rank as the best, most intelligent foray into the tepid rap-metal genre. While their radical politics may not be for everyone (I'll get to that in a minute), when they were ""on"" not many mainstream bands could rival their intensity. Rage Against The Machine's debut is perhaps their most consistent and best album.The debut has a different feel from their later releases--the song structures are stretched longer, and the lyrics read more like political slogans than the poetry of The Battle Of L.A. The rhythm section also plays a more prominent role, with Tim C.'s funky slap-bass rhythms and tight drumming by Brad Wilk. Tom Morello's guitar playing never fails to amaze, with big Led Zeppelin-esque riffs (check out the Kashmir homage on Wake Up!) and unique electronic blips and effects.Zach De La Rocha is a unique vocalist--love him or hate him, few can argue with the power of Rocha's delivery and lyricism, somewhat remiscient of Chuck D. from Public Enemy. And the lyrics here are VERY powerful. Take Know Your Enemy, for example (which features a strong guest vocal by Tool's Maynard Keenan):""Yes, I know my enemies/They're the teachers who taught me to fight me/Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission/Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite/All of which are American dreams..""The last line is repeated several times, driving the song home and leaving the listener stunned. And the album achieves this level of power again on Wake Up, with the verse:""Ya know they murdered X/And tried to blame it on Islam/He turned the power to the have-nots/And then came the shot/What was the price on his head?""The rest of the album approaches or matches this level of quality, with only Settle For Nothing leaving me somewhat cold. Definitely worth a purchase, then check out the great third album The Battle Of L.A. (skip over Evil Empire).Note: I agree with some of the political views and disagree with others expressed on this album (such as the pro-socialism stance), but ultimately it is possible to enjoy the top-notch music and not agree with the rhetoric. As far as being charged as ""hypocrites,"" yes they are on a major label. However, a great deal of Rage Against The Machine's proceeds go to Amnesty International and other organizations, so I wouldn't be so quick to call them ""sellouts."" Just thought I'd contribute my opinion."
1682464,B00DSQZNEG,Wow!!!! Sweet,I have always bought Stevia in the Raw so I thought I'd give this a try. I am pleasantly surprised. The tiny bit that you have to use is unbelievable. I have to wonder how long it will take me to use it all where as I was buying Stevia in the Raw every two weeks. I emptied it into a 1/2 pint jar as it will be easier to use. There was a lot of powder on the walls of the package so I put in a small amount of water sealed it and shook it. Wow is that some sweet water will use it for ice tea...
852656,B00881Q8MM,talk about a rigged game!!!,"No matter what you do on some of these levels, you cannot possibly get through it without a shuffle.  What I mean is you are only given one possible match and no others after that so there has to be  a shuffle, next screen after that----same thing.  I had 4 shuffles in a row because there was only one match possible.  I've been playing mahjong for years so I know how to play.  stinks, I prefer to lose because I didn't make the right choices, not lose because I never had a chance to begin with!!!!"
3660088,B001EE5LEQ,"way, way cheaper than petsmart, petco or local pet stores","poopie bags.  Required to keep neighbors from being angry that you're doggie soiled their yard.  Leaving a crap on a yard is ultimately disrespectful, and nobody will like you.  Stocking up on grocery bags is the easiest way to handle picking up after the business is done.  however, these days, seldome do we get grocery bags that don't have holes or tears in them.  Only thing worse than leaving a poop on a lawn, is smashing your fingers in hot, steaming, stinking dog crap.these bags do the job very well.  They're durable, and don't get torn easily if the poop is by sticks.  plus, they open quickly and easily, and tie up quickly without getting crap on your fingers or hands."
1055540,B00B4KBIZG,its fun. but then bad,"At first it was really fun st first, my kindle fire is in a a case, and then I felt something hot. It was  my kindle. I took it out of the case and I had to turn my kindle off and let it cool  down. After it did I turned  my kindle on and then deleted this app"
1215079,B00FEAKLJ6,Love this game,So many games and levels and so much to do when I have time to play.I would recommend this game to other Mahjong Masters.  I use it on my Kindle Fire HD with no problems.
134554,B009Y0ZH6Y,Great Case,"This is a great case.  It does everything that you could want a case to do.  All of the holes line up correctly, and the buttons are still easy to push.  I like the frosted back as it adds a little pizazz to the case.  I also like the fact that the edges around the front give the phone just enough lift that if you lay it face down, the glass doesn't touch.  And like another reviewer put, it adds just enough stickiness so that it doesn't slide off of things like the sofa.  All in all, it is well made.  It shipped quickly and on time."
2020282,079283318X,Back from the Dead!,"Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is bungee jumping off the top of a massive dam.  He fires a dart with a cable attached to it and it pulls him all the way down to the bottom so he can get free.  He uses a laser to cut through an access plate. He knocks out a guard and enters the kitchen storage area inside a Russian base.  He meets 006, Alec Trevelyan) there and they enter into a laboratory and a storage tanks and prep area for large scale production of chemical weapons.  Alex, 006, is captured and shot in the head.  James hides behind canisters of lethal chemical weapons gas.  James starts a conveyor belt and dumps hundreds of tanks of chemicals onto the soldiers.  James jumps after an empty rolling plane as it drives over a cliff.  He free falls into the plane without a parachute and recovers from the dive and escapes. The weapons plant explodes as he flies away.Many years later, Bond is driving to Monte Carlo and racing a woman in a red sports car.  She is Xenia Onatop who is a criminal member of a crime syndicate.  They are side by side on very dangerous and curvy roads.  Xenia is playing cards in the casino and Bond and her get into a betting contest and James takes all of her money on the second bet.  Xenia is from Russia and she is an ex-Soviet fighter pilot.Xenia is in a relationship with a Canadian Admiral and she murders him that night.  General Ourumov takes the Admiral's place in order to gain access to a naval event held the next day.  It is a demonstration of a new helicopter that can withstand an EMP pulse and survive.  Xenia and Ourumov steal the helicopter at the event. They fly the new tiger stealth helicopter to Russia where they attack a satellite control bunker and steal the control for the Goldeneye satellite secret weapon.....This is a high tech action 007 movie and the first 007 movie done by Pierce Brosnan.  He breathed a breath of new life into the James bond movies again.  This movie features a good cast as have most James bond movies and the high tech special effects of the weapon make the movie seem realistic.  I liked this move a lot and Pierce makes a good Bond with a younger and newer style of action and storyline.  I recommend this movie to you as a good one."
1879020,B001T46THE,Great album from the BOSS!!,"This is a fantastic hiphop gem that bangs in the whip, in the clubs, and while you are just chilling in the crib.  Great Release!!!"
3752685,B001GH5ORK,"great product, secures hood very well",easy install and great replacement for the factory hood latch. It takes away any and all hood flutter especially at highway speeds.
1299917,B00178JDCK,It doesn't totally suck,"Some things are great values, others are cheap. The Behringer is cheap. The clips are cheap. The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change. The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. IF you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. It's also a noisy pedal. Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined. Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. If you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.All of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features. The 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. It also has a worth-the-price-alone ""space"" feature. Also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). Paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.The RV600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. If you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. If you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option."

I enjoy each and every single one, my favorites being Toffee with Almond and the Special Dark ones. Approx. 100 pieces per bag, good value at just $10.00! Great and long lasting for personal use depending on intake or for Halloween if you so choose?! Highly Recommended!"
1520462,B00BGA9WK2,Love the PS4 so far,"The unit has worked well, the graphics are crisp and breathtaking when compared to the PS3. I will be excited once there are more games available.The main issue I had with the product was not the PS4 itself but how Amazon shipped the product(I did not remove a star because it was not the PS4 fault). It was shipped with the PS4 box on the outside so everyone knew exactly what was in the box, the box was all banged up and looked like it was already opened by someone. The UPS guy even commented how poorly it was packaged. Overall the product did not look like it was damaged and they are hard to find so I kept the product, but shame on Amazon for not placing it in a shipping box that was more discrete."
358262,B002CVTVVY,"After comparison, I don't think this is a good deal","I bought this at $138 and used for more than a year.  It was my first electric brush since my dentist recommend me to have one due to my loss of gum.  I brush my teeth too hard.  He suggests me owning an electric brush which can help me protect my gum. After using this one, my gum situation didn't get worse.  But this tooth brush can be messy.  The tooth paste easily drips along the tooth brush head to the actual handle.  Recently, my dentist gave me the brand recommendation since he noticed that my gum situation was still not that idea. He recommend me Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  I got that one from Amazon as well for $105 dollars (33 dollars cheaper).  Now I can tell you the difference.  The Oral-B 5000 is the one!  Not messy and more powerful! With the smartguide system, it is much better than this Philips one.  I would not recommend anyone this product! Instead, get the Oral-B 5000.  The round head is better than the Philips Sonicare long head.  Hope this can help others to choose their first electric tooth brush.  Give 2 stars for attention purpose.  I could give it a 3-star review.  It is OK.  Not that bad.  Definetly not as good as Oral-B 5000 which is even $33 cheaper."
1344362,B00009WDLD,Beware of compatibility problems,"If you think you've got a nice, relatively new computer, therefore you should be able to play Deus Ex. Be careful and read the video card support list very carefully. I have a Dell Dimension 2.4 gHz machine with a Geforce 4MX video card. Deus Ex will not play on this video card. Your card must have Pixel shader 1.1 capability to run. I bought the game and it will not work on my machine. I fell into this trap because I didn't know what the exact video card in my machine was. I assumed that, because it was relatively new and not bottom of the line, it would run pretty much any game out there. Live and learn. Don't make the same mistake as I did.I'm rather discusted with the deus ex creators. I've been eagerly waiting for this game and now I can't play it. They didn't even give me the option of defeating pixel shading. So what if it wouldn't look as nice, at least I would be able to play it.Oh well, The reviews I have read say it was a real disappointment anyway. I'm just glad I didn't run out and buy it for $50 when it was first released. I only got stuck for $20.I guess this game will sit on my shelf until I upgrade my system in a few years. Hopefully it will be compatable with the system I buy then."
3634824,B000M528SK,Toxic,"Hi. I want to point out that the main ingredient in this product is Xylitol which has been shown to be toxic to dogs. Xylitol is a sugar analog which binds various enzymes in the cell but cannot be metabolized as a real sugar. Consequently, this substance can mess up sugar metabolism in canines resulting in acute (and sometimes fatal) hypoglycemia. Don't take my word for it, google it. Xylitol is added to human mouthwash as an active ingredient (in addition to serving as the sweeting agent)-- I think it may inhibit peridontal microbes by blocking their sugar metabolism (don't quote me on this part). Xylitol has not been found to be toxic to humans, and, despite the large amount contained in a mouthwash, we spit it out. Never put anything in your poor pooches water supply! SP"
1352013,B00029QOQS,PATCH ME PLEASE!!!!!!!,"This game wants to be great. The patch finally came out and it runs pretty good now. One more new patch and all the issues should be resolved. Go buy this one now. If you enjoyed RC 1&2, this one's gonna make you wet your pants."
1742531,B000RG2Y56,Excellent starter chisel set,"I bought this for my company and its a very good day to day chisel set for the price.  It comes very sharp and all the chisels are easily sharpened.  Its made of very good quality steel to last a long time and the handles are well attached and made too.  Its not on par with the Japanese chisels, but its also not priced like Japanese chisels.  This chisel set is great for a first set or day to day use.  Great set for the price!"
1031140,B00AO5WLIU,hard to enter answers,"So glad I didn't pay for this. Only positive? I'm about 7 puzzles in and haven't run into ads yet (original KF). But like others have said, they're not true crosswords - there are some strange clues that have no crosscheck because every across and down are not clues. I do like the clues being in puzzle, but tapping in to answer is tricky - its so sensitive that each tap moves the screen instead of allowing me to type. Plus a good 1/3 of the screen is taken up by the puzzle difficulty and the clue you're typing plus another 1/3 when the keyboard pops up.Bottom line: not worth money. or playing."
154920,B00BW6GH76,The hinge breaks too easily,Although I originally loved this case after going through 3 cases for all the same problem I have given up.  Customer service responded quickly asked for information and I haven't heard from them since.  The plastic part that holds the case together breaks very easily.  The white case seemed to hold up the best.  At first I thought it was me but not after the last one I bought didn't last a month before it broke and I was treating it gently.  They seemed to get cheaper even the black matte case has a very thin film that was peeling which didn't happen with the previous case.The case does protect your phone if it drops if it you can live with a broken flap then this is the case for you.

1325897,B00005O0I2,"DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?","First off, I'd like to thank the religious right.  If they didn't constantly complain about this game, I would have never heard of it.  In fact, I bought a Playstation 2 in order to play this.  To say this is a great game would be an understatement.  This game definitely belongs in the greatest game of all time lists.Where to start?  First off, it's addictive.  Very, very addictive.  The Surgeon General and FDA better investigate the addictiveness of this game.  In its most basic form, you steal cars in order to complete missions.  The missions themselves vary widely, from running over someone,  stealing the right type of car, rushing to the airport, to assassinating someone.  You're not just regulated to cars.  Sometimes you have to snipe someone, fire a rocket launcher, or go through a boat chase.The realism, or should I say the general feel, is amazing.  You're not handed a car and weapons, but you steal and buy them respectively.  How to get money?  You could steal a cab and take fares, you could mug random people, or complete missions.  You're not just regulated to a straight and narrow road.  The whole city is open to you.  You actually feel like you're in entire city.  As you play longer, you start recognizing streets and neighborhoods.  You slowly become acclimated to whole place.  Just as if you moved and explored a new city.  Some things are just amazing.  For example, it takes place in rapid real time.  If you have to drive to the other end of the city, it takes three hours in GTA 3 time, and the sunlight adjusts accordingly.  That is detail.  Another example is the radio.  When you steal a car, you actually get to adjust the radio stations.  From talk to reggae, it's all there.How real is this game?  I played this game for thirty hours on one weekend, and by Monday, it actually effected my ability to drive.  I actually had to re-adjust myself to real world driving.  That has never, ever happened before.There are also so many things to do.  There are about 70 something missions to play, but you only need to complete 50 to win the game.  Extra missions are just the tip of the iceberg.  You could steal cabs and take fares, steal ambulances and rescue people, take a cop car and go into vigilante mode.  You might find yourself just exploring or killing random people for no reason.Finally, there's no really stupid plot.  You just meet people, they ask for favors, and then pay you.  Simple and straightfoward.Pros:Best Action/Adventure game ever.Open environment.Addictive.Graphics.Radio stations.Missions (Run, stealth, open ended).Not linear - not stuck at one place.Lots of extra stuff.Realistic (sort of).Cons:Mission failed? Got to get briefed again (too long).Too gray, could have used a splash of color.Sometimes forced to drive long distances.Time: 35 hoursDifficulty: MediumFrustration: Low"
423398,B004I8NO8A,Great clippers with horrible accessories,"Yup, another long review.  You want a short answer if you should buy this...NO!  If you want the long version...keep reading....I am by no means a professional stylist, so forgive me if I say something wrong, spell it incorrectly...or just flat out mess this whole review up because that is what I just did to my sons hair!  Little history here...I have been trimming my almost 6 year olds hair for just about 4 years now, just started doing my 2 year olds, and have trimmed my husbands do for about 8 years now (I can't do his whole head because his barber doesn't use trimmers, I just clean up his neck and sideburns in between trimmings).  With that being said, I am pretty familiar with my current Conair clippers that I have had for the 8 years I have been trimming hubby's do...they are nothing fancy and cost a lot less than this one did, but they aren't cordless  :-(  I have been wanting to try a cordless one for quite some time now, but with 3 kids we are on a budget and toilet paper is higher on the list than a new set of clippers.  Soooo, when I was given the chance to try these out, I jumped on it!  In the end, I am so glad I got to ""try before you buy"" because for what these cost, our family can wipe their bottoms for a few months!  Let the sob story begin....Upon opening the item, I was impressed with the quality feel of the clippers themself...they are trimmed in a soft-touch rubber (the black part)...but the pros end there.  While that soft-touch rubber is soft, it is horribly slippery and in no way a non-slip grip.  The clippers aren't ergonomic and feel awkward in my hand.  It's battery appeared fully charged upon arrival, but as with most rechargeable things, I figured it needed a few hours prior to first use and plugged it in.  It comes with a wall charger as well as a USB charger...really Remington?  A USB charger?  I wouldn't dare put this hairy, at times oily, appliance anywhere near my computer for fear of it sucking in the hairs...that USB wire is only about 12"" long.  The wall charger is a separate plug and has a plenty long cord.  It has an orange LED light when the unit is charging...and I expected it to change to green or possibly cut off when the battery reached 100%, but no...it just stays on the whole time.  So I can't comment on how long it takes to fully recharge although the pathetic manual states 14-16 hours to fully charge.  14-16 hours for such a little thing??  That is ridiculous!!  Another reviewer stated the battery is not replaceable making the unit disposable once it has reached it's lifetime...that is incorrect per Remington as the manual has instructions on how to remove & replace the battery and their website sells a replacement (although for the price, best just buy a new one).Anyways, onward!!  Clippers are charged so I figured I'd get familiar with the accessories.  It comes with this little crappy black zippered canvas-like bag that when trying to put everything in it brought on the same frustrations as trying to put a tent back into the bag it came in (if ya have never tried that...it never fits!)...so in the trash went that bag and out came an old make-up bag that fit it much better.  Also comes with a dinky cleaning brush and bottle o' lube.  The manual is worthless and is pretty much a reminder not to shave and shower at the same time and points out the whopping 4 parts of the trimmers.  Oh wait, I forgot an accessory...a worthless blade cap that doesn't fit...how could I forget that?  Ahhh...that's cuz I threw it away!Now Remington, you have a great concept here with the rounded adjustable guards, but I think I broke one trying to get it off.  And with the crappy ergonomic grip, you can move the adjustable clip changing the trim length while using...this is a horrible experience!  Great concept Remington, but flawed.  I'm not sure if other guards would fit on this or if Remington sells fixed size ones to fit this model...so to be safe, assume if you purchase this that it will be better used without the guards.  I typically use a 3 on my sons sides fading to a 6 on top...he wound up with a bald line up the back of his head because the clip disengaged causing the clippers to nearly skin him.  After that, I just decided to just shave him nearly bald with the 1.5 fixed guard (the only one that is not adjustable)...and that did a great job!To sum all those words up, I'm back to using my antique Conair and don't mind that cord as much as I used to.  These did a great job of trimming the neck and sideburns on both my sons & hubby's do...but so does the $10 trimmer I have for my dog."
1598472,B001RBGELA,Not Really Jerky To Me,"The flavor was very good for this product but the texture is far too soft. I had read that and was looking for a softer, easier to chew jerky but this is not a jerky texture at all.It was more like cooked steak strips thank jerky."
1302365,B004ISK48S,Buy it!!!!!,"I can't say enough good about this amp. I have a Marshall jcm 800 2203 which is a great tube amp, but side by side this little amp really stacks up. First and foremost if you want a tube amp sound go buy a tube amp. But if you want something that is 90% close, well this is it. So versatile, light weight, and well constructed. Great Fender quality for a great price. Love all the presets. I have no problem with buzzing on any channel, clean or otherwise. Excellent guitar amp and I would highly recommend!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!"
1035595,B00AQTAFSW,WHAT?!?! *looks around confused*,"I don't know what I was expecting but sitting on my bed trying to figure this game out for twenty minutes was not on the agenda. Collecting stuff and time limits and killing things are fun, but not in this game. The graphics are blah and not living up to its potential o make me turn on the lights, i'm so freaked out, you know? Save the space on your device for something else."
1546158,B000ED7M3Q,BUGGED,"I purchased this flour to make a quick, gluten-free biscuit recipe that a friend gave me and it has worked great for that recipe.  Tonight, I decided to make a peanut-butter pie for my hubbie's birthday.  Feeling lazy, I used the all-purpose flour to make the pie crust (instead of mixing my own flour mixture...which I usually do!).  Well...the garbanzo bean flour so many reviewers have complained about made the dough horribly bitter.  I added some confectioner's sugar to sweeten it.  I ended up with a gooey mass of something that I plopped into a pan and baked so as not to waste it!  I had to start all over again and made a cereal crust instead.  Double the trouble, double the mess!  THAT's what I get for being lazy!  Anyway, the point is, this flour is great for breads, biscuits, rolls, and so forth, but NOT for anything sweet!  Don't use it for your cakes, cookies, pie crusts, etc.  You won't get the flavor you expect!  Perhaps it should be renamed, ""Some Purpose Flour!""  Happy baking!UPDATE:  Originally, I emphasized that this flour is not for all purposes.  Well, now it seems it is for no purpose at all because it is full of bugs!  I keep my flour in Lock 'n Lock containers and none of my other flours have suffered the same fate (in the same cupboard).  This leads me to believe that the little buggers were already in the flour when I got it...  I'll be looking for another flour mix now!"
1808830,B008NNZTF2,Short lived,"This bulb, the 200 lumen version, died after about 4 months of use. Noticeably short of the advertised 22.8 years. Used maybe 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. Ran through anAPC Back-UPS ES 550(orAPC Back-UPS ES 550 BE550Gfor more reviews), the same one used for my computer, I would think the bulb was reasonably well protected from power surges and other electrical gremlins. My best guess is it failed from heat or dimmer incompatibility. Very expen$ive for such a short lifespan. Not a good return on investment.I've received a replacement on March 16, 2014. Hopefully, it will last a little longer."
1784162,B003UHYDYO,Great Choice for International Travel,"We were able to use this on cruise ships, China and Hong Kong. This allows you to use a single adaptor to the wall and then plug your devices directly into the power strip. Obviously you may still only plug in devices rated for 240 on 240 circuits and 110 in 110 circuits. Many hotels don't provide enough outlets for multiple devices, this fixes the problem."
1527554,B00CYS5DU8,Madden NFL 25 was built for NEXT GEN,"Madden NFL 25 for PlayStation 4 is a MUST HAVE.If you are a fan of this game or Football for that matter, then this is a must have in your household. With improved graphics/visuals, developers have taken you one step closer to deliver what we see every Sunday. With a more interactive crowd and sidelines, it is obvious that Madden 25 is starting to push the envelope to widen the development of the game we all love to play.The infinity engine delivers big time! Rarely do you notice players stumbling on the ground or twitching like last gen's title. Foot planting really delivers with a sense of realism with the new True Step feature. With True Step you see grass flying, more dynamic cut motions and actual football movements.The UI is amazing as well. Hardly no lag when attempting to navigate through screens/windows.This game has become a great stepping stone for the next gen consoles. Though I will say it still needs work. There needs to be more interaction between db's/wr's and I also feel the blocking a.i. needs to be tuned slightly. Noticed some times you may get a lineman who seems to be lost. Completely missing his assignment when its right in front of him. But with &#34;War in the Trenches&#34;, it's obvious that every snap is battle.Another issue I would love to see addressed is speed. I understand pursuit angles sometimes give a player a clear advantage when in pursuit. But I feel that sometimes this happens WAY TOO MUCH. Almost as if speed doesn't matter in the game. At no time should we be seeing a defensive lineman running down a speedy wr/rb. And it's not to say that it doesnt happen on Sunday's, it's just to say that it happens way too much in the game.Overall it is a very fun game for every football gamer. Look forward to meeting up on the virtual gridiron.Also please add the online communities back next year as well. I need to be in a community that plays the same way I do."

1323193,B00005ME6N,horrible game,"Capcom doesn't seem to realize that people play video games for entertainment, not torture. The first boss battle is so hard I just took out the disk and threw it into the trash bin. This is not my idea of fun! Don't waste your money on this crap. All you do is run around looking for things to help you move on. You get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo, then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill (you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie). RE3 is alot better than this one - at least Jill knows how to dodge. If you still wanna try this game, don't pay more than 5 bucks!"
1301012,B002GYWBIM,Practice Amp,"I bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps. If you want the metal sound for practice, then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill. But with the hybrid amps (Vibro Champ) going for not much more, you get better sounds and more settings. I am selling mine and ordered a Super Champ Xd used in new condition for two and a half bills. This Line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding. From now on its tube amps for me, even if i have to pay the price. A good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well, too. Like i said, for a first amp at one bill, the Line 6 isnt too bad. Maybe some day i will be able to afford a Princeton Reverb?"

I have a 3 pounder and an 11 pounder and they think getting these are the bees knees! i tried the other sizes but i think since these just fit right in their mouth they love it.

1465313,B003R7H5TC,Casual Fun!,"Bought this game used after a trade-in. This is a fun game! I like the casual approach - no shifting or fancy wheel needed, just plain SPEED! The campaign is neat because there is a career mode in the game. Both Racer and Cop careers are seperately tracked. Cars unlock as you go through the game. I did nt like the 'must log in' to Analog feature, and the music is junk, but the rest of the game is great, especially the graphics.This is a great game for some casual racing."

1754966,B001AHSDQU,An excellent fan,"This replaces a 25 year old kitchen fan that took 10-20 on/off cycles to start without squealing likea pig in distress. Wow- what a difference!My first surprise was the note in the instructions that this unit should not be placed over any cookingappliance. So I took off the inspection cover to see why. The motor appears to be fully sealed and out of thedirect airstream but it is to the side of the fan squirrel cage wheel and in the exhaust air chamber.Since my old exhaust duct showed little signs of grease buildup I chose to proceed with installation in spite ofthe Panasonic warning. I will add to this review in the future if that proves to be a mistake- but I doubt it will.Almost everything about the fan exhibits quality- complete set of good mounting hardware, a robust housing,very quiet motor and even fairly understandable instructions (it's Japanese) plus a 3 year warranty.A couple of small complaints- the two tapered end bells which the 6"" duct slips over have sharp burrsinside and since these are the two most obvious handles to lift the fan with -it's Ouch to the unwary!Fortunately the blood washes off the fan housing easily.The other complaint is really a minor design flaw. The 1.5 x5 x 3.5 electrical connection box  must be removedto open up the inspection port- not a big deal- but it is the only example of careless design that I found.The fan box is 15.25 long x 11W x 11D (12.5D including the Electrical box)so it can mount between Joists 16"" on centerbut its too high to fit below the attic floor over 2x10 joists. I chose to mount it on top of the floor joists topreserve the attic insulation depth and this made adjusting the fan position to join the ductwork pretty easy.In use it's a dream. It's whisper quiet and blows a strong wind even with 3 elbows, a 3.5 x 10 wide transitionand about 12 feet of ductwork to the outside.We love it!"
2830836,B000BKVQTS,Grimm Ruminations,"I think people are giving `The Brothers Grimm' a little too much credit than it deserves.Working with a premise rife with possibilities, Terry Gilliam's product is, unfortunately, an unremarkable film that verges on lacklustre, riding almost entirely on a screenplay that, while imaginative, seems to settle for the audience grinning with familiarity at the fairytales that it subversively pays homage to. The re-imagination of a number of the stories is contrived, the most tedious and laughable of the lot being the film's nods to the gingerbread man and the Big Bad Wolf from `Little Red Riding Hood'. The film shies away from its most thoughtful scene, when Jacob is forced to consider which reality he would choose - the one he physically experiences, or the one in an illusory magic mirror - and the consequences of that choice. Where Gilliam could have examined how the realm of make-believe can be dangerously beguiling, he stops at a resolution that's unsatisfying for being all too easy.Gilliam's directing work is surprisingly muddled, resulting in patchy editing and inconsistent performances from his actors. He fails monumentally at emotional modulation - a fraternal relationship that's hardly engaging, a throwaway love triangle - and should have probably focussed on delivering on entertainment, in which case any neglect he would have had for his characters, I believe, would have been quite forgivable, if considered at all.In addition, while visual effects don't have to be thoroughly convincing to be fun, the images in this movie appear so campy and artificial, you wonder if any deliberation really went into the realisation of Gilliam's flights of fancy. The production design is also disappointing, considering the movie's settings and the avenues they present for conceiving creative locales and sets. Nothing here compares to the sumptuousness of other films that take full advantage of the vibe afforded by their settings, for instance Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow'.What salvage the movie are Heath Ledger's mildly idiosyncratic performance of a man who seems to be slowly withering inwards till the Grimm pair finds its way to Marbaden, Monica Belluci's delicious evil queen - pretty much a role she sleepwalks through, but fills the shoes of delectably nonetheless - and the occasionally bewitching charm of sheer imagination.I would have given it 2 stars."

3606518,B0002MISZ0,Didn't last long,"I have a medium-sized shepherd mix (weighs under 40 pounds) who likes to chew on her toys, but I wouldn't consider her a very aggressive chewer. This fire hose toy lasted about 5 minutes, before she had the stuffing and squeaker spread out all over the floor.The weakness of it are the two black seams on the ends. Since most dogs will presumably chew from one of the ends, this creates a problem. Also, once an edge of the fire hose material is exposed, it's fairly easy for the dog to unweave it into its various strands.For anyone looking for more durable toys for their dog, I'd recommend the KONG Cozie line (it has lost its tail/ears/feet over time, but otherwise has held up longer), and the Hurley toy by West Paw Designs (she chews on it all the time and it still has no visible signs of damage)."
2012300,0792140346,"IT WAS ME BOY, IT WAS ME!","Primal Fear is my most favorite thriller of all time and we have two wonderfully talented performers, Richard Gere and Edward Norton to thank for that. They really brought these characters to life big time on the screen. Originally they wanted Leonardo DiCaprio for the role of Aaron/Roy Stampler but apparently DiCaprio turned it down and Edward Norton took over the role and I must say he was the best!!! No other actor could have played that role to powerful perfection the way Norton did. Same goes for Richard Gere as big time defense attorney Martin Vail. He was the best for that role too. You could see the chemistry right there between Gere and Norton in that movie. They certainly were ""A Great Team"" as Roy puts it at the end of the movie. It certainly was him, boy! It certainly was him!!! And that is the first biggest twist of the movie, when we are lead to believe that Aaron has multiple personality disorder and has the Roy side to him that comes to his rescue whenever Aaron feels threatened. The biggest twist shocker is at the end when we find out that there never was an Aaron side to this criminal and that the Roy side of him existed all along and he faked the multiple personality disorder syndrome to get away with the crime by being declared insane. This was an absolute 10 star well done shocker! I own the movie after seeing it back in 1996 and have enjoyed watching it all these years and still look forward to watching it many more years to come. I hope Edward Norton will do another surprising psycho role like his Aaron Stampler character in the future. His stuttering and acting was indeed priceless and au natural in this flick. A highly recommended numero uno thriller."

1863956,B00009QGF2,No Excuse Not to Have This CD,"Fountains of Wayne keep getting better -- and they were already one of the best groups going.  This is tuneful pop music written, sung and played with wit, warmth, and wisdom.  Fountains bring a rare and very welcome unaggressive sense of humor to their songs about the feckless, lovelorn, not too bright, but striving and endearing subjects their music celebrates.  You hope with a little bit of luck those subjects will wind up as the couple in Yours and Mine, the short, settled love song that closes the CD.At sixteen songs, the Welcome Interstate Managers gives quantity as well as quality.  For me, four songs don't quite hit the high standard of the rest -- Halley's Waitress (a bit mean), Fire Island (where Fountains forget they're pushing thirty, not fifteen), Peace and Love (spoof of the 60s, that unfortunately spoofs itself) and Supercollider.  As for the rest, best of the best are Bright Future in Sales, No Better Place, Valley Winter Song, the offbeat All Kinds of Time, and Hung Up on You.  The fact that I didn't list the omnipresent and delicious Stacey's Mom is meant to show how good the songs here are."

I used it with my Google Nexus tablet and Torque, running on a Bluetooth connection on a 2012 Mercedes GL diesel with no problems.The only thing against this device is that it is large.  I would prefer a small one.But if you're looking for a good all-around cheap OBD 2 reader, this should do the trick just fine."
1470411,B0042GW7C2,A Tragic Installment to a Great Series,"I ran out and bought Ace Combat Assault Horizon because I love airplane games. And for the past decade it would be a safe statement to say that the Ace Combat games were among the best if not THE best aircraft games available on consoles. I played Ace Combat 6 a lot and loved it. Assault Horizon is just a sad, tragic even, installment for a great franchise.What went wrong? First the flight controls got dumbed down. ""Optimum"" mode is like flying in molasses and terribly frustrating: it is impossible to roll your aircraft. This mode can be disabled if you prefer better controls. However no matter which controls you use, the new ""close combat"" system turns the thrilling fights of previous games into hair-pulling frustrating exercises in button pushing. Assault Horizon calls this experience ""dog fight mode."" In a nutshell if some one is shooting at you slow down and click right and left bumpers all at the same time (as long as some random circles on your screen are lined up) -- do all of this and you can evade incoming missile. The same convoluted button pushing is REQUIRED if you want to shoot sown target leaders (basically enemy aces)-- no matter how many missile locks, how good your attack angle, or any other factor the only thing that matters is putting the leader in some on screen circle and clicking a bunch of buttons simultaneously. It totally destroys the sense of flight in the game.Single player / campaign mode is a total bust. There is a faint glimmer of redemption in the online modes. There is a pretty innovative and fun capture the flag mode. But it is currently difficult to find a lot of players online.At the end of the day, if you were shopping for a flight game for the xbox 360, I have to say stick with (or go find a copy of) Ace Combat 6. HAWX 1 & 2 are also overall better flying games on the xbox. It breaks my heart, but the only honest recommendation I can make about Assault Horizon is SKIP IT."

Of course your unseeable enemies have no such problem and see you easily. and as we all know the gyro and the 3D effects do not play nice together...I found the game just not worth playing on the 3DS.

There are only two connections that need to be made. Installation was done in three minutes.I recommend this to anyone who has found their garage door open unexpectedly.

2269046,6303631991,Bring me something bright and shiny!!!,"Like this set on DVD.Thanks to the fine folks at PBS and their stores I had some of my favorite episodes of this cunningly funny series on VHS. Now I can sit back and spin the entire series on my bright and shiny DVDs.Much has been said about how well written, well acted and well produced the series is, so I won't go over all that again. (Although it is all true) Instead I'll wax rhapsodic over some of the supplements and suprises that await we hysterical history buffs.Though unmentioned until just before the collection's release, ... The Black Adder Chrismas Carol is included in this series. I would daresay that not tossing it in would be a great disservice to the fans of the show. Here we see Edmund in two of the four familiar historical periods and as two new characters. (Three if you count the two versions of the future.) Also making appearances are Queen Vic and her German Sausage of a hubby and Robby Coltraine as the Ghost of Christmas Spirit. I'm pretty sure that this role was a major factor in his getting the part of Hagrid in the Harry Potter Films. This is one of the funniest of all the episodes and required Holiday viewing.We also get two other specials; The Cavalier Years where Edmund and Baldrick are loyalists to a deposed and soon to be executed king and Back and Forth, a hilarious jaunt through history reminiscant of the aforementioned Christmas Carol. Following Michaelangelo's plans Baldrick manages to create a working time machine. This accomplishment causes Edmund to observe that Baldrick is ""One of the worlds greatest geniuses."" The fact that he forgot to add any sort of gauge to allow them to set the controls to return home is ""a stunning return to form."" On this trip our heroes run into Shakespeare, Robin Hood and a large T-Rex.We also get a plethora of slightly skewed historical data, some trailers for other British series and an interview with Richard Curtis.Fans of the show will love all of the additional specials and features. People not fans of this show will be by the time they get through this set."
1734450,B000LJOX94,Away from the elements,"I'm so glad I got this safe.  It has plenty of space for household needs.  I'm just out of college but it is nice to have a safe haven from fire and water for important things (papers, passport, titles, jewelry, or whatever you have of value).  The compartment inside is perfect to hold a full size letter, unfolded flat on the bottom inside a plastic cover.  It's surprising how much can fit in .36 cubic feet.  I have lots of space left!A few things that should be mentioned-Some complain about the seal and that you have to push down to lock it.  My safe had a paper tab hanging on the safe that instructed specifically to push down to engage the lock to create the water/fireproof seal.-It's a safe that is protected from fire and water, not burglary rated.  Unless you create a metal bracket around it and bolt it to the floor, it can be stolen.  But that is not what you buy this for.  You get this to keep your things safe from a fire or flood.-Due to the mobility of the safe.  I don't recommend locking up a firearm either.  (There's a warning label inside against this as well).  Only a matter of time elsewhere until a thief gets it open.The lock and awkward shape (no handle, just some grip points) makes things just less easy to steal.  Find a place you like and just leave it there.  The barrel lock gives me a little more security after seeing youtube videos of other safes with a standard key being broken into with a coin or a quick rap to the mechanism with a hammer.  Feels sturdy when it's locked down.While researching these safes, I thought it's interesting that after a fire, the material melts around the compartment to seal in your contents and you usually have to pry it all apart after the fire department does their job."
1430285,B0028IBTLG,"Outdated graphics, crazy bugs, constant long load screens . They should pay us to QA this game!","I am a huge Fallout fan having played through most all of the games, but this game jsut isn't there on any level.The graphics are really outdated for today's standards, and no attempt was made to update them at all, the fight animations are laughably bad with enemies literally colliding into your guy who looks liek he can't move.Computer bugs, all over the place, even with the latest patch- I mean my companions, disappeared for no reason, got stuck int he ceiling, etc...Too many useless options, versions of quests, I mean really I don;'t need to decide between joining, currying favor with 20 different groups! Keep it simple.Load times and load screens all over the place, enter a house, load screen, leave the house load screen again, change your brightness level option, load screen again!!No warning that you are about to die from radiation poisoning, vats makes little sense, for instance you will miss 3 times even though you have a 95% in vats to hit an area.Unfinishable quests all over the place, and bizarre difficulty spikes, some robots you will kill with one shot, others will kill you instantly.For the good this is aHUGE game, if you can stomach the bugs, constant load times, and other problems, you could potentially play it for months.Also what is the point of having Karma, and a reputation system? Do I really need to be told 20 times that my Karma has gone down because I opened a locked door?? Do I really care that the viper gangers hate me for killing them after they randomly attacked me??No interesting enemies...not many interesting characters or weapons.Here's hoping that they make an updated Fallout with new graphics, better combat, and quests that make sense."
1431453,B002ABZDMM,Pretty weak game,"I bought this as a deal of the day just to check it out. Unfortunately, it's a pretty horrible game. As far as the story - nothing terribly new. It's an interesting enough story involving most of your favorite characters from the tv series.Where the game falls FAR short of expectations is the production value. The playability is rough across the board, with difficult to control characters and a LOT of glitches. This will be tough for younger players, who might get frustrated when it takes an hour to hit just the right spot on a droid to blow it up. In addition to being really hard to play, the design of the game is pretty poor. It looks like an early generation PS2 game with lackluster graphics, boxy characters and moderately non-interactive environments. And sadly, all 40 missions involve little more than button mashing - something we'd expect from a game in 1998. To top it off, players will be treated to a yappy Yoda, who constantly pops up on screen to offer tips - even near the end of the game. This gets a little old. Ok, a lot old.All in all, this is a pretty bad game. It's just not fun. Adults will find it excruciatingly boring and kids will find it tough to play (and probably also boring). If it wasn't a Star Wars game, it would probably disappear in a month as a failure. But since it ties into the popular series, I'm sure many will find it a necessary, if not stellar, addition to their collection.Pros: Decent story, good voice acting, familiar characters in a rich and colorful world.Cons: Poor substandard graphics, horrid player controls, annoying interface, boring and repetitive design with endless button mashing, a PS2 game at a PS3 priceGames are largely about the value now. What is this one worth? $14.99 is probably a fair price. Anything more is too much to pay for this particular game."
1539569,B0008D6WBA,Quality gelatin,I purchased this brand due to recommendations from others in the paleo community.  I should be making bone broths for my source but just can't stomach the smell of it cooking at this time.  I am currently pregnant and want to make sure my body has plenty of the building blocks for healthy skin as my stomach grows.  I am also trying to heal my gut.  If I make soups I add some in and then any hot drinks get some added too.  I have been very pleased with this product so far and will order more when the time comes.

3658117,B001BCOZ3E,Best Dog Food,"When we adopted our dog last year, we started her on Wellness b/c I knew I wanted to feed her premium dog food and it had a good reputation. Well her stool was always loose while she was on it and we eventually had to add metamucil to her diet to make it more firm. Finally I decided to switch her food to Organix and couldn't be happier. It has a higher fiber content than many other dog foods and many of the ingredients are organic. Cameron loves the food and her stool is nice and firm. And she poops less often too. As one other reviewer said, because the ingredients are so nutritious, you'll end up feeding your dog less of this brand than other dog foods that are made of filler. Couldn't be happier now that the food's part of the auto-ship program."

1844591,B000003GZA,"20,000 albums in my library, and this is the worst","This album reminds me of when, in the late 60s, Sammy Davis Jr. or Dean Martin would go on TV, wearing love beads and flowers, their hands dancing with faux LSD moves. It was so contrived, it was funny in the most unintentional ways. Several points arise:1-This is the worst Sgt. Pepperploxtation I know of. Neon Philharmonic take the worst psudo-psycadellia, and the worst soft rock mush, and put them together, making the horridness of the music actually grow expadentially.2-Everything here is over-the-top and brash. The strings, horns, and vocals are all interesting in theroy, but it is as if one of the Texes hicks in Easy Rider got a copy of Forever Changes and decided to cut a record in a very expensiVe drug store booth.3-The singer can't sing, and much worse, THINKS HE CAN!But definately buy this. It is so bad, you need to have it, just for novalty value. (I remember being at a party completely sober and rolling on the ground laughing at this.)  Everytime you buy a new CD of any genre, you'll be able to take this out, knowing your new purchace will be comparatively better."

1497753,B005TH6BD4,Pop Heads with a Hostess?,"The game is huge,you will def get your moneys worth that's for sure. It's a spin off and also the end of the Tokyo location and game engine..Hence the title ""of the end"". Part 5 is being developed as we speak with tons of work to be done considering they are making a whole new engine. Now I won't go into heavy detail as I did with my Yakuza 4 review, but give my pros and cons.Pros:Storyline- Can never say more than enough for a STELLAR storyline.. you will not find better from any series including cutscenes.Characters- The loan Shark,Dragon of Kansai and Majima join Kazuma into gunning hordes of zombies popping heads like it's going out of style. Can't ask for a better team.Graphics- Same as 4,same engine..Love it or hate it, it works.Mini games- Are all here..Whether you like to bowl, play slots,arcades,cards,mahjong,hostess bars,batting cages,karaoke,massage parlors tell me when to stop..And many many side missions for each character(One example is saving store fronts and reopening businesses).When complete you can have the option to travel around a normal town or apocalyptic town with zombies.Cons:Sadly the controls are a little problematic at first,but as you play you will be popping heads with a hostess in no time.Some Framerate issues at times.Overall it's a great end to this engine and the Tokyo location. I hope when 5 is complete they bring it to the West. Sadly other reviewers will sway hordes of people from even touching the series. Thank you Sega for supporting your fans."

1872651,B000BM6AVA,"A garbage truck coming down the street. Here, take ""Hypnotize"" with ya!","I review fairly. This review is no different.The pros of ""Hypnotize"" is that it has intriguing rhythms along with its captivating guitar riffs. That's one aspect of this CD though. Highlights are ""Dreaming"" with its unusual problematic view of society, the title track with its expression of the negative impact of television, the upbeat ""U-Fig,"" ""Holy Mountains,"" and the overused expression of the word ""banana"" in ""Vicinity of Obscenity."" 5 tracks out of 12! Wow, amazing! Paparazzi come to a party and shoot balloons! Also, the artwork of the booklet, which also features its lyrics, is uniquely exquisite.The con of ""Hypnotize"" are the lyrics! For those who aren't familiar with reading my reviews, I'm a lyrics person, and the lyrics always matter, forever! Even one line can destroy a song. I'm a harsh critic, but I judge fairly. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being different, and I don't mind if not admire unique lyrics; I'm a weird fellow myself, but when you talk about unnecessary institutional urgent destruction (Attack), watching someone's death ""everday"" (Kill Rock 'N Roll), ""looking for a mother that will get me high"" (Stealing Society), heplessness and hopelessness (Tentative), explotation of a heroin abuser (She's Like Heroin), lonliness (Lonely Day), and unknown prophetic religious denial (Soldier Side), then there's a problem. Open your eyes, folks, to those who had experience with this album; all these 4 or 5-star reviews are quite unsound, even if they talk about the negative lyrical content and still praise the album.Now, there is one track on ""Hypnotize"" that opened my eyes and told me that lyrics don't always matter; rhythm impact does too. There'll be a bit of controversy because of this review, but I can deal with the relative aftermath. This is a pathetic way to leave the music industry, a lasting impression of ""Hypnotize."" System of a Down fell off, and this album advocates my point."

Excellent,"I was hesitant at first to try this All Natural Energy Juice Drink that I received from the Vine Program here at Amazon.... but boy am I glad I did.  This is an excellent beverage.  I probably would not bought it  without first trying it because I don't normally like carbonated drinks.  But I will now buy it --  since it is actually quite good.If you cannot drink coffee, and don't like tea that much, then this is a way to get your caffeine.  It has 80 grams of caffeine, which sounds like a lot but after I drank it this morning I really felt energized and not extremely caffeinated.  Traditional caffeine feels very agitating to me.  I also like the fresh taste and the juicy-ness of this drink.  If you are looking for a way to get your caffeine burst in the morning (or afternoon) without using the more traditional ways of getting it, then this is great.This would also be a great drink to travel with.  The size of the can is nice and small and would fit into a travel bag or purse quite nicely."

Bad...just bad.Secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.

1676217,B00BDFNRG0,Thanks Orville for putting the junk right back into junk food!,"The cheese flavoring has an overly processed flavor which is a little disappointing.  I am a fan of junk food as a treat every now and then, but this would be the last thing in my cupboard I would ever want to reach for. The actual corn is bland, flat and not crunchy as you would like it to be.  It does have a strange coating on it, a little too sweet for a cheddar mix, but what the heck do I know, maybe its because it is gluten-free? Although I do not have allergies, for those that may suffer be sure to check out the label as its processed in a factory that processes just about every nut someone may be allergic too. I usually like Orville Redenbacher's products, but this one significantly missed the mark."

1811183,B009GMWWMM,"Fragile base. Otherwise, impressively bright and stable light; concerns about switch","2013-03-16: My original ranking was 4-star. I have lower it to 2-star because of inadequate durability. The lamp was near the edge of a table and its cord got tangled in another and pulled off, falling to a carpeted floor with good padding. This is something that inevitably happens to such lamps. Although the light itself was not damaged, the repairs may or may not be within what you can easily do (details end). With minimal repairs, the lamp is still usable, it has lost its utility that I found most appealing: a very bright light that I could easily move to various locations and adjust to the circumstances.--- Original review ---This is an impressively bright light. My problem is with its switch, which is mounted on the underneath side of the head of the lamp. The box and some of the product photos show the switch on the base (where I would prefer it to be).1. Because of the flexibility of the gooseneck, you cannot simply _push_ on the switch. Instead you need to grasp the head and this leaves very visible smudges on the top (which is shiny black plastic). FYI if this is likely to irritate you, or someone you live with.2. Operating the switch may involve uncomfortable turning of your wrist (which is a problem for me at times). With the head parallel to the table, the more neutral position of my wrist has the thumb above and the curled-in forefinger on the switch. Do-able, but not ""natural"". The more natural grasp -- placing the thumb on the switch -- involves not just rotating my wrist, but rotating my arm upward.3. I can't see the quality of the switch, but it feels less robust and durable than those typically installed in the base of such lamps.Positioning: The 14-inch neck starts to bends at roughly 7 inches above the base. With it bent at a right angle, the head of the light is 7.5 inches above the table and the bulb is about 6 inches in front of the leading edge of the base.Area of illumination: With the head parallel to the table, the diameter of the brightest area is about double the height of the head (eg, 16 inches wide when the head is 8 inches high). The light falls off fairly quickly beyond this area.The power adapter is a ""wall wart"" (not in the base) that is 1.5-inches wide -- wide enough to block the adjacent outlets in power-strips that don't provide some additional space.Problem: The power cord is _very_ thin. While it is entirely adequate to handle the low power used by this lamp, cords to lamps often need to endure a certain amount of abuse, for example, from being buffeted by other objects on the table. I am particularly sensitive to this concern because I have a cat that is very diligent about checking out potential mouse tails (I armored my power cord with ""split loom tubing"", a common remedy).The base is heavy enough to provide excellent stability in all configurations I tried. The gooseneck seems very robust and durable.Fit and Finish: Other reviews here reported minor problems. Mine had no finish problems. However, internals of the base were not level: For the back half, the felt pad on the base was too high to make contact with the surface under it. In my situation, this didn't make any difference because the plastic rim provided enough friction to keep the lamp in place, but YMMV.Is the power adapter a ""vampire""? No. With the lamp off it doesn't draw measurable power (according to myKill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor). When on, it uses 7 watts.2013-03-16: Details: The weighted base popped out and broke into several large pieces. This was easily fixable with some glue and re-inserting. What is not easily fixable is that the portion of the base holding the neck in place fragmented into small pieces and dust (the weight is a fragile ceramic), leaving a lot of play in the neck. This may be fixable, but looks to require a trip to the hardware store for some suitable rubber/plastic washers. And the shattered portion of the weight is what held the lamp to the base. This may be fixable with a caulking compound (weak, thick ""glue"" to fasten the weight to the upper metal housing).-- Douglas B. Moran"

Immunity?  Well I didn't get sick, but then I haven't had a cold or the flu in several years.  Focus?  Since that comes and goes anyway, it's hard to say if EBoost had anything to do with it.As Hermione Grainger might say ""The claims for EBoost are rather wooly.""Taste?  Well, I can't say I was impressed.  At best some people will find it unobjectionable.  I hated it, but then I hate most of the health/protein/energy stuff on the market.

1657465,B006BXUY2Y,Yumm-ish?,"Hi,I like this breakfast/snack bar alot but not a whole lot.  I like the fact that the 'dark chocolate' (which is deceptive) really tastes like dark chocolate.  However, I believe Kellog's uses the chocolate flavoring substance to cover up the other things that are going on with this bar.First,  A small container of yogurt will have less calories and fat than this bar will.  Additionally, this bar contains caffeine, which is a natural appetite suppressant.Secondly, this breakfast bar contains a lot of sodium and fats.Always look at the ingredient labels before purchasing these breakfast bars or drinks--they often contain a great deal of ingredients that you would not normally eat...or give to your kids.Whenever I get a snack attack, I go for a Nature Valley bar.  It's just granola, oats, & honey (there are some other ingredients but it's a heck of a lot better than overly-processed junk.All the Best toYou and Yours,Miles"

Not only that, but he knew I had one in my pocket and wanted that one; sitting staring at me the way only a Vizsla owner would understand.  Yes I love my dog. And he knows that, Damn it.  So I give him the best there is:Cadet's Duck and Sweet Potato treats. By the way, he didn't eat the rest until after he had eaten the one I had in my pocket.

1867999,B0002JUWZW,Don't Forget About This Album,"Shyne's Godfather Buried Alive was released in late 2003 and it seems the disc has become a forgotten.Well the disc is mad hot. The production is crazy. The album includes production by Kanye West, Irv Gotti, Swizz Beats, Just Blaze, Moses Leviy among others. The song ""More or Less"" is hot an ""Quasi o.g."" has a reggae hip hop thing going on. ""Behind The Walls"" (east coast gangsta mix) features Korupt and Nate Dogg along with Shyne. You have to wonder if the lyrics are new because Shyne refers to himself as Po on most cuts. Po is a nickname he adopted for himself. The track ""Shyne"" is just a banger, something for the boys in the streets to pump when they are riding out this summer. The ladies will like this cut also.On the track ""Martyr"" Shyne questions whether life is better than death. Ashanti is featured on the track ""Jimmy Choo."" Foxy Brown also appears on a few cuts. ""Godfather"" is another cut that is for the streets and the radio.The album art work is nice. Inside of the disc are not one but two pictures of Shyne and the late Lisa Left Eye Lopes along with older pics of Shyne.13 cuts deep Godfather Buried Alive is the Shyne album that his fans have been waiting for and fans new and old won't be let down. It was worth the wait."

1420680,B001IK5TJI,I played better games 30 years ago,"Terrible.  Just terrible.  However, I'll admit up front that I only played a few hours of this game.  Why?  Because I expected a good RPG, not a dialogue driven soap opera.The amount of ""talking"" in this game is ridiculous.  I've got things to do... I don't have hours on end to discuss the problems of the world with fantasy bar maids, relatives, and other luminaries of the fantasy rpg world.  Dude - it takes a long time to get through the conversations if you speed them up by punching the buttons!  Ridiculous.For the sake or argument, let's say that you actually like that sort of thing.  Perhaps some gamers really like to immerse themselves in the experience and interact with the characters in the world.  Ok - I'll tip my hat and accept that as a reasonable premise.  However, you still can't ignore the fact that combat is a joke.  Some games allow a reasonable degree of control over character combat options.  Others, like Fallout 3 (awesome btw) give you a range of choices, included the VATS system.  Then you have DragonAge Origins - the ""click and sit there twiddling your thumbs while your character swings away with no real direction"".  Yeah... that's a lot of fun.Perhaps the biggest problem with this game is the lack of character options.  Basically three classes and three races.  Pathetic.  Especially pathetic given the scope of these games.  I have been playing games for over 30 years and Wizardy (the FIRST one) had better character generation than this.  So did Ultima, Wizard's Crown, Might and Magic, The Bard's Tale, Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, Morrowind, etc.  Oh yes I did... I did play the Wizard's Crown Card!  Still one of the best inventory and loot systems I've ever seen."
3605087,B0002I0O60,My lab loves her squirrels!,Our dog loves to carry this around and play with it.

A few of the squirrels have had surgery to remove their sqeakers (she does that to every squeaky toy) but otherwise it has held up well.  It is one of her favorite things to grab and meet us at the door with.

347948,B001VEK1KI,31S replacement for 31B,"I fell prey to the advertisement ""31S is a newer model of the 31B"". So I bought one, only to discover that the 31S foil has larger spaces in the center cutting blades than the 31B which causes the foil cutter to chew up your skin to the point of drawing blood around my lips. The pair of new 31S internal blades work well with my old 31B foil cover. The problem is all in the design of the center cutting blades of the 31S foil cover. The only place that I can find 31B is from South Korean companies thru ebay. In my case Amazon let me down when they stopped selling the 31B. They probably will not post this review and a lot of customers out there will have their faces chewed up."

1625506,B0040K41MY,"Great idea, not so great execution","I try to avoid gluten, so cereals have pretty much become a thing of the past for me.  I was very excited to try a gluten free cereal.  If you only care about the taste, then this cereal is fairly enjoyable.  However, it is advertised as a health food and this is where I run into issues.  The first ingredients are whole grain corn meal, evaporated cane juice, brown rice flour and inulin.  They are all organic, but corn is one of the worst things that you can put into your body and it appears to be the bulk of this cereal...well, except for the evaporated cane juice! (aka sugar).  The package advertises is as a good source of fiber and omega-3.  There are only 3 grams of fiber (not bad, but not great) and only 1 gram of fat.  How can this be high in omega-3 fatty acids when there is only 1 gram (or possibly less) per serving?  Then you look at the nutrient profile: Vitamin A- 0; Vitamin C- 0, Calcium - 0.I guess this is a step up from normal junk food cereal, but I think it falls short of what it advertises.  I do not think I will purchase any more."

36806,B004J15326,Came in a standard envelope,"Should have known... the last time I received screen protectors in a standard envelope, I was sorely disappointed. Very hard to apply to the screen without trapping dust. The protectors themselves seem to arrive with lint/dust on them. The surface of the protector is very rubbery/tacky to the point that it was actually a bit of a chore to navigate about the touchscreen. Left it on for 2-3 days (numerous bubbles trapped underneath, despite my efforts w/ a credit card and 2 applications). As soon as my replacement product arrived (different manufacturer), this was gone. Replacement product went on much easier, with 98% less bubbles, and no tacky/rubbery feel. Not looking back."
479337,B0086UI32S,A bitter aftertaste,"This tastes terrible, despite the cinnamon, leaving a bitter aftertaste from the soy isolate.  I would hardly describe the ingredients as natural: soy protein isolate (which isn't that good for you), yellow degermed corn flour, corn starch (GMO?), inulin, tapioca starch, xanthan gum are a few of the non-whole foods. Nothing at all is described as organic, just the meaningless ""natural"" label. The shape and overall feel is between a Corn Chex and a Life cereal square, not a cookie. It is crunchy but that isn't enough. If you want to carb out on a gluten-free snack get a Udi's GF muffin, which is at least tasty enough to satisfy.  This just made me want to engage in full dental care to get rid of the aftertaste."

The description says ""Heavy Duty"" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead."

Close, but no cigar.Chocolate taste on the coating is minimal, though melts with finger heat just like the real thing.  Body is crumbly, heavy and bland.  I noticed a full, but backgroundish chemical taste (not oder).  There was little feel or taste for a chocolate fudge energy bar.Yes, it's edible.  Recommended?

The numbers are large enough and bright enough to be viewed easily from at least 75 feet (the distance from where I mounted them on my home to the street). Having had some bad experiences with solar items in the past, I'm hoping that this one will help to get the bad taste out of my mouth. At this point, so far so good."
1769968,B002JM0DEK,It looks good but is inaccurate.,I was really looking forward to this.  I have had weather instruments for 20 years.  It looked good coming out of the box.  I added batteries.  The display is a little dim as reported but it can be lived with as long as the instruments are accurate.  BUT they are not.  I set the internal and external probes 2 inches from each other.  They started about 5 degrees different.  Letting it stand all night I thought they would normalize but they didn't.  Checking throughout the morning I found that they fluctuated between 1 to 3 degrees apart.  For the price they should be a lot lot better.  I am returning it as defective.

1302502,B004T6M7DE,Crooked Bridge Causes Defective Low E String Intonation,"Right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off (fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp). After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it. I'm going to get a Squier Strat instead (with either aMapleorRosewoodneck).---[Update November 15, 2013]I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until December. Then, to my surprise, the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday! Yay!! :D The happiness!!I was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated. It's Red Burst like the Legacy (Fender calls it Antique Burst). It's a beautful guitar and and I'm loving it!"
309742,B0019LRYK8,"Small but beneficial effect, no jitters","There is pretty good science backing up green tea, specifically EGCg as helpful in promoting weight loss.

The actual amount of EGCg in this product is very high for the cost in comparison to competitors.  Definitely a high quality product.  I would stack with fucoxanthin and CLA.  Don't expect miracles, but if you like purchasing supplements to support diet or fitness goals, I would recommend it."

I had the orignal one that game with motorstorm back in 07 and it was great.Well I'm not really feeling this new super slim ps3.I do think it looks great, and I love the new way to put in the disc but the shiny part I don't like. It is a cat hair magnet, and anyone with cats or dogs will see the hair being stuck on the shiny part.Also I find this new console to be decently loud and it makes a high tone scretching sound alot.It also gets hot very quickly, and for some reason game disc always spin even when your not playing a game.But besides me not liking the console that much, you do get a free month of plus, goty edition of uncharted 3 and some extras for dust 514 but I do think dust sucks.Overall for the price it's a good deal, but the old model and the regular slim are better than this one."
3757528,B0041DZ48K,ok,Installed to the parking lights and fender lights. Directions didn't match my vehicle. Seems like the directions were for an older model jeep wrangler. I managed to get the parking light covers on but not the fender signal covers. Need to update your information rugged ridge.

Was there a reaction to my taste buds for drinking the Midnight Magic first? Possibly, did I get a bad Kcup?

1994772,0790741067,Another mess by Robert Altman,"Robert Altman fans are like &quot;Velvet Underground&quot; fans: There are only about 500 of them around, they fanatically defend the object of their adulation, they insist that their love is the source of inspiration for everything that came out after them in their respective venues (rock music/film), even when no one else has even heard of them, they find the lack of technique as intentional and laudable, they seem to admire pointlessness. Does anyone really think the man who made &quot;Popeye&quot; is a genius? Everyone I know hated this film - and not because of some perceived attack on capitalism (which I think you need to have a wild imagination to see in this film) but because it seems so pointless, boring, downright pretentious. It is a grade Z art film."

Tested up to 30' away from phone and works fine.  Easy to pair with iPhone.  Looks great but the clear ear stabilizers were worthless for me but still fit held in my ear snugly.  Will have to do further testing to confirm battery life and moisture resistance claims, but out of the box the on screen battery meter showed half charged and after about 4 songs and a quick call I got a vocal low battery alert through the headphones.  Anyway, a great value since I got it new for $50 shipped through an amazon seller compared to the Jaybirds I was considering."
3759685,B006QH9C5A,Works great! Instructions could be better.,"First off I'd like to say this unit works excellent. The remote fobs are excellent and the range seems to be pretty darn good.I installed it into a 1996 F250 with an OEM non remote power lock setup. Power locks are nice but without a remote setup their usefulness is somewhat limited. I did a search here on Amazon and came up with this setup for far less than I expected. After reading many of the reviews I knew the instructions would be lacking but decided to give it a try anyway. I'm glad I did.This system isn't super advanced but does offer a couple of features other than just locking and unlocking the doors if you choose to use them. One feature is the notification system. The system shows a wire being hooked to the ""direction light."" This wire ""flashes"" once for lock and twice for unlock. The idea is to connect this to your outside directional lights to give you a visual indication that the system either locked or unlocked the doors. I didn't utilize this feature but if I did I think I would connect it to the horn instead of the lights. Just a way to confirm to myself that I did indeed lock the doors before walking away. There is also a wire for unlocking the trunk but with the exception of a label in the instructions there is no indication as to whether this is actually active in this system.A feature that would be nice is to allow the user the ability to ""setup"" some features. One feature that some may like is to allow the user the ability to change the output of the ""flash"" output. I would prefer one flash for unlock and two for lock but there is no way to change this. For the price of this unit though it would be hard to really fault this system for its ""basicness.""The last issue here to discuss is the instructions, or lack of them. The reality is that it would be very difficult to include very extensive instructions because each installation is going to depend on the model of vehicle you are installing this into. A better layout of the basic drawings would be nice though. It took me a little while to figure out exactly how the diagrams related to the included unit but I did figure it out. By far the more difficult part was coming up with the vehicle specific diagrams. the service manual I had included the wrong diagrams and therefore added a lot of work to this installation. That is not the fault of the maker of this unit though, that is a problem with my service manual.Overall I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who feels they can figure out the wiring. If wiring diagrams confuse you and vehicle wiring scares you, then I recommend you either buy something else or have this installed by a professional. Personally I think it works great and was well worth the effort to figure it out."

3567498,B00GST8U4U,Homage to the Old Man and the Sea.,"I've been a life long fan of Robert Redford's, and saying that, I do believe if one is not a fan of his this movie will grind on ones patience. First off, there's only a sparse few sentences of dialogue and the pacing slow. You have to pay attention. The protagonist is gritty old Redford, and the antagonist is the uncertain Ocean and the hole in his boat. Secondly, its not a conventionally beautiful picture, there's no touching scenes of humpback whales or epic shots of clouds, its a raw look at survival. And thirdly: not much is the audience given: who he is, why he's there, where he's going. The director assumes these are not important points and leaves it to our imagination. As Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea was his final story. 'All is Lost' I hope will not be Redford's last. A true original auteur in a changing industry, a man against not only the mega picture elements of Hollywood, but age."

Also, these are shorter than standard earplugs, so buyer beware -- you might find yourself needing to pluck these out with a pair of tweezers (as I have had to do several times).  In addition, they don't block as much noise as standard-sized ear plugs.  I bought these along with a small pack ofSleep Pretty in Pink Women's Ear Plugs, 14 Pairs.

1348050,B0000V48KM,Waste of time,"Hmm, what to say about this game. Its pretty ""meh"". It doesn't do anything well, and does a number of things pretty badly. I would not suggest this game to anyone looking for a FPS. The AI was horrible, weapons were bland and boring to fire. They all sounded underpowered (and pretty much are underpowered). The level design is pretty bad, everything is scripted and feels like a shooting gallery. The teammate AI is horrible and doesn't help at all. In fact, they get in the way most of the time. The graphics are horrible too. Overall the game feels pretty old fashioned and more like it was made by a mod team then an actual developer. The only cool thing about it is the cut scenes that are actually pretty neat. I am surprised I bothered finishing this one."

3756014,B00353PWAW,"Nice suds, not so nice finish","This is an update to my original review in June 2010, which was very positive.This IS a nice product, producing copious suds that last, good at cleaning the vehicle.  So, nothing new there.However, I always wondered about the claims of the wash containing carnauba and polymers. Since one normally has to buff waxes off the car, just HOW did this product leave these wax type finishes on a car? Why wouldn't you have to buff this after using it?Then it occurred to me. My black car always has a good wax finish - do I NEED to be putting something from a wash in addition to that? When I wash a car, I hose it down, mix up the sudsy shampoo, wash all areas, squeegie off the water with a silicon blade and finish up by wiping up any remaining droplets/moisture with one of those damp, ChamWow type, high absorbancy felt towels. This worked fine, BUT, with the Meguiar's, I always had to follow up on the glass with an additional buffing from a bath type towel. If I didn't buff the windows, even though they had been wiped clean of droplets by the ChamWow, they would be very streaked/spotted in the direct sunlight. So, although I didn't see direct streaking of the paint, I have to assume that it had the same issue as the unbuffed windows, given I wasn't buffing the car paint itself.I actually had gone to buy a new bottle of the Meguiar's. Hadn't paid much attention to prices, in that I always want a good shampoo. But then I noticed that this product is twice the price of other name brand shampoos such as Black Magic and Rain-X. PLUS, this product calls for 1 oz per GALLON, whereas those others call for 1 oz per BUCKET. So, it's actually FOUR times the price of the others.So, came back with the Black Magic, which is just a cleaning shampoo. At 1 oz per bucket (vs. the Maquiar's 2) it foamed very well, but didn't last quite as long. But, long enough to get the job done with foamy soap. I DID notice that the windows weren't streaked and car actually DOES seem to have a better shine - but have to admit, that could be wishful thinking.So, in conclusion, think this product leaves some sort of film on the car, and not a glassy one. There are plenty of options out there at 1/4 the cost, that leave NO film.  If you are willing to pay four times the price, suspect you already keep your vehicle waxed, so the dubious benefit of this product containing waxes as protectants, is a waste of money as well as leaving a less that sparkling clean finish on the car."
3705157,B004QGO1LS,Great product but no match for a lab puppy!,High quailty product for the price but would not stand up to my 8 month old lab puppy! It takes him about 10 minutes to devour each stick. I was hoping it would last a lot longer so keep this in mind if you have a labrador.
1866573,B00018D44U,A disasterous sophomore release with no personality,"Wow.  What can say?  I can safely say Nora won't have to worry about carting home eight Grammys next year.  She won't have to worry about carting away one.  This is one of the biggest sophomore flops I can remember and my expectations were not even that high.There are so many things wrong with this CD: 1) The sound transfer to the CD is awful.  I played this at a low volume and her voice was still distorted in three of the songs.  2) The material, melodies and album continuity is absolutely dismal.  I only liked one song on the disc, In The Morning, which is why I even gave it two stars.  These are not quality written songs.  3) She did a duet with Dolly Parton on Creepin' In and Dolly wasn't listed as a co-singer.  She was only listed in the ""appears as a courtesy"" section.  Such disrespect for an icon.  4) The record company released the liner notes with unfinished paper.  Yep, not even a gloss finish.  It's no surprise because it matches the rest of the album - CHEAP.Friends and fellow music lovers, if you think this is going to be even remotely like her debut album, you are wrong.  This is unprofessional piano lounge music.  I think Capitol Records owes the music community an explanation.  This reeks of corporate greed and does nothing to raise musical interests."
1669366,B0091146V8,Great For Tea!,"I love this little Javajig! I've used it for coffee and have had great results. The only downside I've found for the coffee is assembling it before I am quite awake - the coffee was good but the K Cups are easier for first thing in the morning coffee. You could always set it up the night before. It worked fine for ground coffee and is a price saver for sure. The coffee should be very finely ground for the best results.What I have discovered that I absolutely love about the JavaJig is putting it in empty and filling my tea cup that has a removeable infuser. I put in the empty jig, put the tea inside the cup and make the tea. My tea cup has a lid that I use to steep the tea and then remove the infuser before drinking. This makes a perfect cup of tea that is super easy and delisious. Anyway, you can use the jig to just run hot water for tea bags or any type of tea. It doesn't work that great if you put the loose leaf tea (perhaps it would work better if the tea was finely ground) in the jig-it makes a weak cup of tea but if you have an infuser and can steep the brew as you normally would, it works very well. Nice little invention, this!I just noticed on QVC that the newer Keurig brewers are coming with their own version of this type of product to use with other coffees and tea. For the older models, like I have, this jig is the same as the My K Cup. The newer brewers are coming out with a hot water option, but using the empty java jig is the same. You can also use the hot water for instant soups and instant oatmeal."

1825175,B000001DVP,Elton John For Dummies,"The absolute bare-bones essential Elton John - that's what this album is. Containing perhaps his 10 most famous songs - some of the biggest hit singles of the first half of the 1970's - as well as the wonderful album track, Border Song, it is certainly a masterful collection of wonderful songs that will get anyone who hears it hooked on Elton. It contains all of his big hit singles from this period (except for three: [""]Tiny Dancer[""] (now enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to its appearance in the movie Almost Famous), [""]Levon[""], and [""]The Bitch Is Back[""].) Although he has always had many great dedicated album tracks, to most people, Elton John will always be a singles artist. And the singles here are immaculate - wonderful, acutely perfect pop nuggets, from the master. No one other than The Beatles (and even they didn't do it as well) can touch Elton on crafting absolute pop perfection. And these songs are proof. It's a fine place to start if you're looking to dip your toe into the world of Elton John. That said, it by no means gives a full picture of this magnificent and multi-faceted artist. Some of his albums - particularly the sprawling double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, still one of my favorite records of all time - have a great feel and mood all their own (four tracks here are excerpted from it), and deserve to be heard on their own. Instead, let this be your ticket to experience more Elton John, in all his immaculate pop greatness."
1836968,B000002KKN,Prince Finds His Muse For Success,"In my humble opinion Prince's debut album 'For You' is a huge artistic success and one of his very best albums.But it wasn't even slightly commercial and closely related to R&B and funk.With 1979's 'Prince' all of that changed as he began his quest of building hid own eclectic style mixing funk,soul,pop and rock n' roll.This album is far more highly polished and commercial then the debut featuring Prince's first Top 10 pop entery in 'I Wanna Be Your Lover"",a catchy funky pop tune with the original version of 'I Feel For You""-a similar song structure but Chaka Khan took it all the way to the bank five years later.The album consists largely of soft love ballads,the best of which is the dreamy ""It's Gonna be Lonely"".Two of the best cuts are rockier-the big catchy guitar pop of ""Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad"" and the heavy metal of ""Bambi',a screaming guitar tribute to Prince trying to convince his lesbian 'girlfriend' that 'it's better with a man'.Very nervy lyric and this album has alot more of that then the first.The albums funkiest song is the repetitive ""Sexy Dancer"" and it does groove hard.'Prince' is a high quality collection of the first incarnation of the Minneapolis Sound.In fact on this and his debut one gets to hear the 'Purple Rain'-era sound in it's embryonic,trial and error stages.And what a marvelous trip it is."

5482,B001630QZE,Newcomer to bluetooth but impressed,"I just had to trade in my five year old clunker cellphone, no bluetooth, so I'm suddenly able to use a BT earpiece.  I am trying the 925 because of the high overall Amazon rating.- Easy fit and extremely comfortable.  The earpiece design is a little weird, but works well, you have to trust it.  Basically can't feel it after either 2 minutes or 2 hours, which is good.- Bluetooth pairing easy, took four seconds.- Sound quality incoming and outcoming is very good.- Basics are: Tap to accept call, tap to disconnect.- Beyond the basics: A series of commands, tap, double tap, 2 sec tap, 4 sec tap, that doing different things during ringing, during a call, etc.  Confusing? Yeah.  Remember: Tap to accept, Tap to disconnect!- Bells and whistles: Comes with a case about 1x1x3"" that stores it and also has a battery and charges it during storage.  The case and the earpiece can also charge separately, and both AC and USB cables are included.I've avoided these because (a) no BT cellphone and (b) convinced they look stupid, all brands, on all people.  Now I see the popularity: easy to use, extremely light, extremely comfortable, great sound.  Today I was driving, in and out of drugstore, and home to my PC all while listening to a business call I had to monitor.  Not much need for a corded earpiece any more.For mute function, no combination of taps gets there on the headset, use the button on your cellphone and the headset is muted."
1857010,B00005KKAK,"too much, too little, too ""light""","It is obvious that all concerned got carried away with the optimistism of this project.  The song ideas are all brilliant at their very core, but  the lack of a real rhythym section playing live (as well as the absence of an outside production voice)  have prevented the vital essence  that  some honest critique in the production process would have lent to this effort.  I felt myself wanting LESS songs , had they been  produced with a live rhythm section and ""worked up"".  Also the album lacks those instrumental moments that make an album shine:  even a SINGER'S projects should employ and stretch a wider array of musicians.  The overall effect of the production here equates to a very slick ""demo"".  Ian Devaney is a crackerjack writer, arranger, and producer, as well a REAL musician himself.  One can only assume he was too amongst the trees to notice the growing forest around him.After some additional listening, I'm softening my stance a bit with this edited review.  Of note are the songs ""you can do that"" (an affirming and sticky light groove that hooks the listener immediately and show's Ian's knack for sparing and effective horn arrangement), ""how could you?"" (a Bacharach-tribute arrangement with a bold dynamic jolt in the chorus), ""face up"" (hypnotic and helpful mantra for those timid in love...), and ""let's just call it love"" (an off-the-cuff techno groove that's undeniably hip and spontaneous and keeps Lisa ""in-character"" despite new sonic territory).  ""831"" should have been farmed-out to a teen act, where it would have sold lorries-full!  Lisa just sounds a little to grown-up to pitch it's bubblegum mania.  ""Wish on Me"" suffers from an under-developed lyric and would have been stunning in a more organic recording; here it sounds too slick and registers as insincere.  ""candy"" would be wickedly delicious if done in ""crunch funk"" style with a live R&B; band.I can understand Lisa's disappointment at the lack of a great reception for something she'd worked long and hard on.  I guess the point here is that a little less indulgence is sometimes a good thing.  You will find at least 3 songs here you dig, more if you're a Lisa fan, so I'll not dis-recommend it, I'll just say ""DIABETICS BEWARE""....

When we got it she really like how small it was and how bright the light was. We installed it on her Keychain but for some reason it either got taken off by someone or it was knocked off by accident. We wanted the Red color so she could find it fast.Anyway, we would love to have another try at it with your offer to replace the Keychain Flashlight Red FREE of charge.After getting the replacement light from you we will let you know how it works out for her.Thank you ahead of time for the replacement Red Keychain Flashlight.Today we received a new Keychain LED Flashlight in the mail. I was really pleased at how fast the replacement got here.My wife now has the new Flashlight to go to her car after work. That is what I call service from a company. No questions asked and we got a replacement FREE after the original Keychain LED Flashlight was lost the first day she took it to work. Thank again!"

3616038,B0007IOYIE,Nigh Impossible to Assemble!,"The GoodIt is very lightweight, easy to clean, and sturdy. I think It's a little deep for our pug, but it should work out ok.The BadThe zippers catch frequently, as though the canvas is pulled too tight, and my 1 yr old daughter won't stop playing with it, lolThe UGLYNow i did get it put together, but dear god! I never want to have to take it apart for fear of not getting up again. Let me clarify this by first stating that I am a 30 year old male, with good upper body strength (I'm 6'2"" 240# & a massage therapist - I  work intensely with my hands). That said, I could BARELY get the two support bars, that hold the structure erect, together. There is no way I could see the average person assembling this thing with anything resembling ease.I would have just knocked off one star for this, but it was so incredibly frustrating that I took two off for this and the zippers.UPDATE: The mesh is terribly weak. My dog (&lt;18# pug) got excited to get out and barely nicked the mesh, I watched it tear from side to side and it tore halfway across in another spot about an inch higher. There is also a decent sized hole in the back upper corner. Simply put, they need better material to hold this together. Can I put 0 stars?"

2794534,B0009ML2KQ,Honolulu to SFO...in real time!,"The very first star studded disaster film. Without the stars but with insulting racial stereotypes. So the set up: John crashed a plane and killed his wife and kid ages ago. Yet he whistles while he works. A plane load of ""characters"" flying from Honolulu to San Francisco. A propellor flies off, miscalulations on the part of the hallucinating navigator, Robert Stack thanks John Wayne for slapping him, the passengers joke and flirt in that inimitable '50's way even though they have been told that the plane is going into the drink this side of San Francisco. This is awful in that hokey 1950s way. I think this thing was the inspiration for ""Airplane!"".And to top it all off, John doesn't slap Robert until two and a half hours into this lame dog! No wonder it hasn't been on TV for 20 years. It took that long to re-wind the tape! I sat all the way through this thing. Learn from my mistake. Try Rio Grande for epic John Wayne instead. Two stars, but for La Wayne and the costumes. And the workmanlike filming."

1728001,B000H12DQ6,Warped Table,"Great value but table top was warped.  1/8 inch out, center to right side.  Otherwise, I liked the table so I called Bosch to try to order just a replacement top but no luck.  The Bosch rep claimed there is a history of tops damaged in shipping and the defect was not due to manufacturing.  The table shipped in the original Bosch packaging, with no additional outer packaging from Amazon.  The table weighs about 40 pounds.  There was no visible damage to the box or the contents.  Too bad because I would have preferred to keep the table.  I returned the table with Amazon's typical superb no questions asked return policy."

1834370,B000002H72,Their breakout album,"I never heard of The Pixies prior to an impulse purchase when Doolittle was a new release. After first listen I wasn't sure what to make of it. In part annoyed, in part drawn by the shear weirdness it took a few spins to fall in love with this album.Their third release, Doolittle brought a glossier mix with their major label debut. Instant classics include Here Comes Your Man and Monkey Gone To Heaven. These were smart, instantly catchy amalgams of surf, punk and power pop.At the time the soft-loud mixture was fairly unique and borrowed frequently by many popular alternative artists today. But what made The Pixies so unique were the lyrical topics, over the top humor and wild swings in Black Francis' vocals. Listen to Debaser or Wave of Mutilation to get a hint at how wild these songs were for their time. Yet behind this aggressive post punk there was great songwriting with stinging guitars from Joey Santiago and the great rhythm section of David Loverling and Kim Deal. The latter were sophisticated in their simplicity. Also appealing was the vocal interplay between Kim Deal and Black Frances.There isn't a bad song on this CD even though lots of territory is covered from the faux anglo rock of La La Love You to the punk meets pop of Gouge Away.In many respects this is the blueprint of many modern punk and alternative acts. What sets it apart from recordings in 1989 is it's unabashed vitality and sense of humor. This is a great rock album that should not be missed."

1557699,B000GFYRHG,A marketing fad does not make for a nice tea,"""Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai"" seems more like an attempt to cash in on a health fad instead of creating a balanced and delicious tea.  Here you have three products that have recently been hailed as miracle foods all bundled into one cuppa together.Although the health benefits and drawbacks of both green tea andpomegranate juicehave been well-documented, theAcai berry'sclaims are more tenuous.  Acai berries have fewer antioxidants than grapes or blueberries, and no credible evidence exists supporting the other miraculous claims.  Even so, with this tea listing ""pomegranate and acai flavors"" as the final ingredient on the package, the amount of each fruit is so minimal as to be inconsequential.  There is far more ""organic hibiscus"" and ""organic rose hips"" in this tea than either pomegranate or acai ""flavors.""But the real bottom line on any tea is the ""Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai"" just doesn't taste very nice.  It tastes like none of the listed ingredients, and comes off as more of an attempt at makingKool-Aid-flavored  tea than anything else."
1426870,B001TOTST0,Batman Arkham Asylum Collectors Edition A BUST!!!!!!!,"Quick and easy, this game is freaking awesome!!!! But the collectors edition like so many others was a total rip of money from us the grateful consumers. I got my copy of the Collector's Edition way later for just under half the original price. Once I opened it up I realized the screw job set before me, I mean the case and protective foam padding made up 95% of the so called Collector's Edition WTF? Even at half the price I still got way more for my 60$dollars spent just buying the GOTY version of the game.What you get with Collectors edition:You Spend 100 bucks for:1. Plastic Batman Shaped container box2. Plastic Replica Bat-a-rang3. Special non Plastic, game case housing for game and bonus disc content. (F.Y.I. bonus content is on the REGULAR and GOTY VERSION of Arkham Asylum all contained on one disc. nothing to special there)4. Sup-par So called Doctor Journal which is basicly a Game menu Insert. (Nothing Special what so ever)5. DLC for crime alley, big whoop you can DL most of the content for free on the PSN store. The other two DLC cost 3.99 is far more worth it that shelling out a 100 bucks.Save your cash, buy the Game and the DLC content screwed the filler. ""Really start doing your research with these so called Collector's Edition games"" make sure its totally worth the purchase!Hopefully Batman Arkham City will do right buy us this time!!!"

2218479,6302760046,Age does not decide who likes this movie...,"This is undoubtebly one of the best movies ever made.  It is different, it is mind-blowing.  After viewing, I felt myself yearning for it to be true. Almost every movie on the market is dominated by dailogue, maybe that is why this movie is such a breath of fresh air from mindless action movies and even good dramas.It is rare for movies to make you wonder, think, or be changed as much as this movie does.  The unpatient will not like this movie, which, I admit, is mostly teens.  I'm probably the only one who likes the movie in my school.  The movie at times moves almost painfully slow, which is the contrary to almost every other movie, that is why it is so great.Though the best thing about this movie is the wonder.  It evokes the mind into things it has never thought before, which I think, is the best thing a movie can do.  To make one think.  The monolith can mean anything the viewer wants it to, which gives an unbelievable sense of freedom that no others offer.  And the enlightening image of the starchild at the climax is one of the most mind-blowing scnenes in cinema history.Other than the recognized components of this movie, there are also others that stick out.  The special effects and cinematography are incredibly artistic, the evoke emotion.  The music is genious and fits perfectly into the movie, making it perfect.I'm young and fascinated by this movie."
3729261,B008H9QHCG,Disappointing,"Bought this because the shorter days means we often get out at night, plus at the cottage there is no lights on the yard and we couldn't see where our dog was.Unfortunately, the light is VERY uneven, it's bright at the ""source"" and gets very dim afterwards; the last seciton is not even lit at all. There is a large area that has no light (clip + battery/button), if there were spaced apart it would've been better to have two small parts without light instead of one large area.Also, the collar is very wide for the size. Our dog has a small collar but the width would be fine for a much large dog. I guess all sizes have the same width.In the end, we'll try another option with multiple lEDs, at least the output will be consistent. We are very disappointed with the product."
2365689,6305810109,The worst part of being old is rememberin' when you was young.,"With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a ""blind date"" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich&eacute; use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' ""Looking at America"" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just ""played it safe"".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!Grade: ** out of *****"
91233,B0086TBI08,Great Product,Not knowing that i was going to love this case. When it came in the mail i was so happy with the style and the color.

745399,B006VLNIFQ,Why bother?,"The game itself is about touching the screen accurately. That is all.  It is very hard to get out of when you start it.  The ""home"" button at the bottom does not work well.  That is the basis for my bad review.  Any game I can't get out of, I delete immediately."

203840,B0000CFXSL,Fantastic!,"I don't know what people are complaining about with holding onto dishes.  Maybe they bought the wrong size or maybe they just needed something to complain about.  These gloves are great, durable and surprisingly pliable for their durability. They're a little stiffer than those latex gloves you can buy at the store but nothing to complain about and they're non latex, which is huge.  I normally where a medium/small glove, I bought medium in these and the fit is perfect.  After a full day of cleaning with these gloves I had no issues with sweating or grasping onto things and then I just threw them in the laundry to clean them up. Wonderful!  I'll probably buy the other colors just to have designated gloves for scrubbing floors, dishes and outside use.  I highly recommend these."
1840657,B000002OVJ,What Did They Do with My Song?,"Sorry I can't rate this one higher but its not for the music which rocks but for the remastering. I heard the original on tape and then bought the remastered cd.  This was conceived as an official bootleg and was the first of its kind. It was a clever idea as the bootleg industry was gaining steam at the time and the band wanted some of the cut. Fair enough. The original record and cassette said something along the line of ""clicks and pops intact"". In other word it was rough and raw similar to a bootleg but without the guilt. Perfect for a band who have called themselves the ""godfathers of punk"". However, this reissue despite having many more songs (the complete concert, plus their full set of Tommy if you buy the deluxe version) has been remastered and overdubbed so it hardly sounds live at all. I don't want to know how the Who wished they had sounded live, I want to hear how they actually did sound live (which judging by the concerts I've heard from the 60's is pretty damn good). Bring the clicks and pops back please."

1650585,B005HG9ERW,I have to admit -- this is good bottled water.,"So, I don't normally drink bottled water. I'm not convinced the benefits of 'vapor distilled' or 'enhanced with minerals' offsets the obvious drawbacks of the chemicals & waste of using plastic bottles.HOWEVER -- I sampled this product through the Vine program, and was pleasantly surprised.+ : This water tastes good. Period. Compared to many other brands I've had, this actually does taste nice. Very, very slightly 'sweet' taste, with no hint of the iodiney/plasticky taste you normally get from bottled water. They did a good job here.+ : the 1.5 liter size means it's good to bring along on a sports trip or other adventure. I took mine with me when I went surfing and it provided plenty of hydration to counter the effects of hours of intense physical activity.- : these run about $2 / bottle -- perhaps not bad, really, given how much you get per bottle... but, it's also quite a bit of waste and a lot of bulk to be shipping from Amazon.BOTTOM LINE: I'm not sure about the pH thing -- there are a lot of health gimmicks out there. However, this water seems to be a fair value and does indeed have a nice 'neutral' flavor. Tastes a lot like it came straight out of the R-O filter vs. being cooped up inside a plastic bottle. If I saw this at the convenience store and I was thirsty, I'd consider buying it over some other popular brands."

There's some things that they didn't post that I found ton o' people including me had issues with, so I'm posting it.I'm getting the same errors as well.  Error code: 5005 Doing an extensive google search revealed that there was something wrong with install shield Ver. 7. However, the steps I did are posted below, none of them worked so I will tell you what worked for me.I copied the entire DVD to my HDD, and installed it from there instead.  It worked fine.Anyway, then I had to edit the DVD rom drive cause running the game, it was looking for the DVD on the wrong place, obviously.  So I edited the key inHKEY Current user / software/ konami/ metal gear solid 2 substance and edited where it said SrcDrv to the drive letter of my DVD rom which was E:\and it ran great!!If that doesn't work, it may be your install shield.  Visit [...] and find the links there to update your install shield.  It has great links to update the engine, driver, and so forth - its designed for consumers who are having problems with Install shield products.  Its pretty lengthy, but hopefully one of the above would work for you.And then install patch 02, even if you have nvidia.  I set all the settings on high, except for model detail and everything ran and looked gorgeous.  I was suprised because model detail, you would think that was characters and stuff.  I was like great, this is gonna be crappy.  But it wasn't.  With that setting on low, everything else on high, it ran beautifully on my Geforce FX 5600 Ultra!  I mean, it looked incredible.  I highly recommend you get this game and do the steps if you run into trouble.  I feel sorry for the folks who bought the game earlier cause the patch didn't do squat for them.  So if you were debating whether or not you should buy it, yes, it totally works and any work arounds you will need to do is very small.  (It just took me a couple hours to figure it out that's why I'm sharing my info)HTHRye"

1847757,B00000ADG2,Music that plays to my soul...,"I purchased this album, when I probably needed it the most. The music from The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is perfect, when you are at a crossroads in your life. Transitions are inevitable, in life, as is change. What better way to celebrate and explore this fact, than through music? Ms. Hill's brilliant and Grammy Award winning album sheds light on numerous topics. Lyrically deep and melodically intrinsic, we learn about what makes this amazing artist tick.One of my favorite cuts (of all time) is ""Lost Ones."" She proceeds to knock her haters, with style and grace. It verges on scripture. The mean hip hop hook and smooth raps/vocals seal the deal for me. I could head bop to this, all day long, as I work out or do just about anything. My second favorite song is ""Tell Him."" This is her love letter to God. Just smooth, makes me feel like I am at a revival. The interludes, between the songs, are wonderful. A teacher/speaker proceeds to lead young people through a series of guided discussions about life. The students are engaged, funny and insightful.What makes this album so exceptional is the smooth transition from genre to genre. Lauryn Hill blends them, like a pro. Hip hop, reggae, soul and samples are melded into a sound painting. Glorious."

1381672,B000K9OP2A,This game is cursed!,"this game is simply amazing, fun, great story, it is like playing a movie,it has great voice acting beautiful characters with very nice graphics it plays in the same style like god of war but with less violence.you start the game normally then after you finish a chapter you can play parts of the chapter later, a stage select option to be exact, the controls are very simple,the combos though can be a bit tricky.in some parts in the game there is thing called after touch where you control the item after you throw it you can use the sixaxis function it will be fun at first but then it will only get on your nerves(in my opinion ) as it will sense the slights movement and you wont be able to control the projectile, but it is easily fixed with option of using the analog stick.but i gave it four out of five because it tends to be too easy but not in bad way i wish it would have a bit more puzzles and the enemy fights gets tiring after a while gets repetitive a bit but not in a dynasty warriors  way.so is this game worth buying? yes definitely.why is it cursed? all of the house electronics in the house started to act weird malfunctioning --but it has nothing to do with game.....i think"

1365440,B000B6ML0A,Nice change of pace,"If you like any mario or cartoonish adventure game then this is definately worth looking at. This has to be one of the most beautifully animated games ive ever seen, in the beginning of the game you are in an elf kingdom wandering about, and the detail everthing down to the blades of grass is astonishing. I played the first hour of the game just wandering arounding looking at this highly detailed enviroment, this must have cost some serious artist hours. But enough about looks, kameo herself only has 2 moves one is sprawling out her wings and hovering around which is the fastest way to travel and the other is a backflip kick which is her only attack, but the fun starts when you get the characters that you can morph into, each has their own abilties and you can upgrade them with fruits that you can get in several different ways, ranging from helping some poor tree man get rid of the pests in his house, to winning them in side games that show your skill with the warrior trainer, also when you start getting more characters you can chain the morphing and the moves together for really cool effects, in some places you have to, bottom line a beautfully rendered game, with a decnt story and fun gameplay, not a bad deal at the lowered price."

1837202,B000002KNO,What were they thinking?,"Frankly, I don't know what Van Halen was thinking when they recorded this album.  We do know that &quot;Fair Warning&quot; did not do well, so perhaps the band felt that in order to reobtain commerical success, they  should play cover songs.  Well, it worked in that regard, but this is an  absolute creative nadir for the band.Of course, there are two originals  on this album which do stand out: &quot;Secrets&quot; and &quot;Little  Guitars&quot;.  These two pieces have instrumental preludes in common,  &quot;Cathedral&quot; and &quot;Little Guitars (Intro)&quot;, and they  again serve notice that Edward was indeed king of rock guitar mountain.  &quot;Secrets&quot; is beautiful, complete with electric 12 string guitar  and beautiful vocal harmonies, while &quot;Little Guitars&quot; is unique  because Ed is, in fact, playing a little guitar.  It's also a darn good  song.Then we have two other originals: &quot;Hang Em High&quot; and  &quot;The Full Bug&quot;.  Uninspired, at best.  Sure, they sound good, but  this sounds like Van Halen is going through the motions and not being truly  creative.The rest of the songs are covers:  &quot;Where Have All The  Good Times Gone?&quot;, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (with another prelude,  &quot;Intruder&quot;, to open it), &quot;Dancing In The Streets&quot;,  &quot;Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)&quot;, and &quot;Happy  Trails&quot;.  At least &quot;Big Bad Bill&quot; has the late Jan Van Halen  playing clarinet to give the song some credibility, and we can gather from  &quot;Happy Trials&quot; that Ed and Michael Anthony are truly talented  when it comes to background vocals.  But five albums into their career, the  question to ask is whether or not Van Halen should have taken this career  path.  In interviews since the release of &quot;Diver Down&quot;, Ed has  slammed the album, while David Lee Roth defends it as a good party record.  Yeah, it's good as a coaster.Be your own judge, but if you buy this,  don't expect the Van Halen of &quot;Fair Warning&quot;."
1423527,B001P5HM64,To Bardo and Back,"I'm glad that I overcame my initial hesitancy to buy Cursed Mountain, because the past several days I've found myself unable to do much else besides play this game. There are several challenges that the mountain gave which were quite enjoyable, and some intense battles with ghosts and demons. The creators did a solid job integrating the Wii remote into the game, and made use of the speaker in a fun way. Throughout the game you do have to combine different movements during combat which initially caused problems. Often the game/sensor bar would not pick up the gestures, and it was not until the end that I seemed to find the correct rhythm/ movement needed. The M rating seems a bit of a stretch, but there was a very brief moment that brought in an adult theme. If you are looking for blood and gore, this is not the game for you.  Something to also keep in mind is that it is a short game (it took me about 15 hrs.) and so far there does not seem to be much replay value (no change in gameplay/ extras/ etc. ). The positives far outweigh those aspects though. The storyline made it hard to walk away, and I have to say I love how they utilized the spooky side of Buddhism. Overall Cursed Mountain ranks up there with my favorite Wii games."

They seem to do an adequate job of cleaning my dishes and don't leave a residue, though it is suggested that you use Jet Dry to protect against spots & residue.  A bit confusing, because elsewhere the box says ""Powershine Formula"" with rinse agent to help eliminate spots & film.Edit: 1/9/13  I've noticed quite a bit of film appearing on glass and metal items.

3746359,B000BUQOAE,No more pooh left in the hose.,"This thing is amazing. I had camped a lot with my parents when I was younger, but that consisted of a pop-up camper and utilizing an empty coffee can when you had to take a leak in the middle of the night. I purchased my first camper in May of 2012 and it was a fifth wheel with an indoor bathroom. Well trying to buy all the little doohickeys that you need is unreal and boy does it add up fast, but I would highly recommend this doohickey to anyone. The first time I used it I knew that I had gotten my monies worth. This thing is great and the way it allows you to wash your hose out when you are done is just priceless.

1316046,B00004U1R1,"Putting A ""Mask"" On A Good Game!",It is sad to say the least that what made this game horrible was the fact that there was time added!! How does it ever make sense that you have temples lodead with many things to get not to mention going into ten different rooms just to get to an enemy yet you only have 72 hours game time to complete the task?! Not to mention side quests and loads of things to do. The sotry line was cool and the graphics were great but this comes nothing close to Ocarina Of Time which I enjoyed sooo much! In fact I think Ocarina Of Time was waaaaaay better then this. If you are going to make a game make the ememies hard and the task difficult but don't add time. Picture if you were half way through a temple and were almost done then time runs out!! That would make you want to pull your hair!! Thankfully from the looks of future games I have seen they did not make that fatal mistake again! I recomend to buy Orcarina Of Time better!
2097067,6300214087,Why Friday the 13th is a complete and total failure,"I've now seen Cunningham's bag of blatant thievery 3 times in my life, and never again will I choose to sit down and view it.Why?It doesn't deliver in any respects of either the genre in which it stands (horror) or any aspect of film making in general; it's a quick cash in, like those DVDs you see on the new release wall that are vaguely similar to new Hollywood releases (Monster, What a Killer Calls, Snakes on a Train; you get the idea)Cunningham took Carpenter's idea of a psychopath and made it, oddly enough just like Jason Vorhees, completely and utterly retarded. There is no intelligence to be found in the film at all what so ever, or in most cases, in the brains of the film's defenders.Now comes a question of age, and with that comes a question of nostalgia; I'm 24, obviously I wasn't even alive when the first Ft13th was released, but I didn't grow up on the horror films of the 90's like I'm sure some of you overweight, balding and sweaty fanboys are ready to declare; no, I grew up on the Universal Monsters and Hammer Horror films, in regards to scares and thrills.Later on in life I discovered the Giallo genre (Bava, Martino, Argento, and some of Fulci's films fall immediately into this category.); a genre vastly superior in every way to the American slasher film, which seem to be nothing more than watered down takes on the Italian genre; no wit, no style, nothing memorable at all, American film makers just took the T&A; and violence aspect from those films & fed them to pre-teen or pubescent people in mass quantities.Then there's the question of the, & this is, pointlessly, debatable, master of horror & suspense: Alfred Hitchcock; Friday the 13th's score, at least the one in the original, reeks of blatant theft from Hermann's score for Psycho, and the ""conversations"" between Jason's mother and ""Jason"" again stink of Norman speaking to ""Mother""; Cunningham takes Hitchcock's ideas and, again, Americanizes them; they're watered down, simply understood and perform solely on a base level.The characters truly are a testament to a failed screenplay; relateable, how? I have a personality outside of one that can be found in a crackerjack box full of cliche and stereotypes, boring thoughts and comments and an absurd degree of stupidity.And once again we see Cunningham dipping his hands into Carpenter's pot with the POV shots; at this point the film is completely lost to any chance of any sort of merit, be it of artistic or entertainment.Horror works on two levels:1.) It's realistic and it's a possible event: Funny Games immediately comes to mind.2.) It's like a nightmare from which there is seemingly no escape: Suspiria is a high ranker in this regards.Friday the 13th does neither; it simply wants your money, and if you were stupid enough to pay for it 29 years ago, chances are you'll never let go.""It was great then, it scared the hell out of me.""Well, if everything that was great, I mean truly fantastic, when you were younger was still as great now as it was then we'd have quite a few problems to deal with in regards to cinema."
2144524,6301619560,This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen,"This movie is wonderfully funny but didn't do to well in the box office (nor since).  The plot, brefeily, is about a viking who, during an aborted rape makes a real emotional connection with his potential victim begins to question if all the piliaging and looting is really worthwhile ( he alreday thinks rape is kind of crude and would prefer there to be some mutual effection, but doesn't want the other vikings to think he is a geek) and he sets off on a quest to find the gods and end the age of Ragnorok.  Ah, but there is the rub.  The gods live in Valhalla ( their heaven ) and the only way to get there is to die in combat.  Unfortunatly the understanding of many of the jokes in this movie are vastly enhanced by some knowledge of the Norse mythology that forms their basis jokes, and that knowledge is just not wide spread in the U.S.  ( I mean, come on, I live a mile from a Christian school call their sports teams the Vikings, that's like osama calling his gang the crusaders).One of the wonderful things about thigs film are the humerouse intersections of these particular Norse customs/beliefs with very real and timeless human interplay between the charactes that trancends culture, particularly in the way boys behave.  One viking taunts another that his grandfather died of old age ( the only way to get to valhallha being to die in battle ), one tuanting another at his sea-sickness in mock sympathy while actually trying to get him to puke more  (""alot of the best sailors wher pukers... all the way out and all the way back, puke puke puke, used to puck in his sleep""), a father pointing out to his son that ""when I was your age I used to go beserk all the time"" and a delightful scean where Eric ( tim robbins ) explains to his father ( I think Micky Roony) that he has come to question their life style and his father acts like you would expect Jesse Helms to react if he found out a son was gay.  Of the sceans of this type, however, probably none is as good as the opening rape scean, where tim robbins fumbling attempts to initiate a rape make it clear he is inexpericned and lead to being mocked and lectured by the victim all while he responds with the embarassment of a young boy chagrined at being discovered to be less cool than he wants the other vikings to believe.  This develops into an argument in wich he justifies his actions as being things that are just self evidently the sort of things one should do while she attack the logical foundation of his reasoning.  ( while the premise of this scean could be found to be offensive by many it is so over the top funny it is one of my favorite comedy sceans ever )Among other themes this film touches on ( and I don't mean to indicate that this film is deep, it is certainly not, but it does address serious issues in a lighthearted way) are the conflicts between the norse religion and the blooming of christianity, their different world views, racial intolerence ( a fovorite scean being a japanse overseer on a slave ship who whips the men at the oars while mocking everything about them ( in subtitles)  from their lack of subtlety and failure to worship their ancestors, to the fact that cook their fish and have large breasted women,) the futility of missionaries among those who can think, and what would happen to the arms industry if peace broke out.  This movie is filled with delightful details.I don't mean to go on, but haveing just watched this again I am still smileing to mysef and want to share that you.  Read some norse mythology first and you will get even more from this delighful film."

137557,B00A6WWPAK,"Quality product, but the proprietary headphone connector and rendering my cables useless turned me away","I really wanted to like this case as I thought it would give me the ultimate protection for my iPhone 5.  However, the proprietary headphone jack cable that you must carry around with you and the ultra small hole for the lightning connector proved to be too much of a negative for me.I found this case to have the following PROS:*  Well made with quality materials*  Easy to assemble or disassemble considering the tolerances of the fit, which are tight*  Protective screen cover doesn't cause any delay in touch responseI found this case to have the following CONS:*  Proprietary headphone jack connector*  Headphone jack connector must be carried with phone at all times if you wish to use the jack.  They could have made this optional so if you wanted to use it without the connector, you can.*  Headphone jack connector is $20 for an extra one; only available from them.*  The hole for the charge port is too small.  It only fits Apple OEM plug.  Aftermarket plugs, such as the awesome 6ft RND lightning cable I bought Amazon don't fit, so you can't use them.So, if you never plan to use the headphone jack and you use nothing but the OEM lightning cable, this case may work for you.  However, if either of those are a factor for you, I would look elsewhere."
3743886,B0006IX87S,Best buy for water filters,"I spend about 10 solid weeks a year during the summer on the road with our family of 6 people. For years I have bought one of these before each season. We get an entire summer out  of one of these and I have never been let down by bad tasting water. Why spend a lot when this filter does what you need.I have used these filters for about 12 years and they are the best for the money. They really last a few months of constant use.I mounted this water filter in line inside trailer where I was able to cut main line in and added hose fittings to accomadate the filter ( most water lines in are a hose material untill they tie into pex tubing so this was easy to do with basic hose fittings ((if its easy to get to as mine is)).Doing it this way I dont need to mess with the filter everytime I setup and breakdown anymore outside trailer.I also add a 2nd one on the cold water side of the main kitchen sink. Pex tubing is what the trailer has as water piping as do most RV these days. I added filter to the pex piping using pex hose fitting as well to accomadate the filter. They sell the filters in 2 packs for about 24.00 so for me its way less exspensive installing these 2 great filters and not worrying about clean water all summer. End of season I simply unscrew the old filter and put in new ones in 5 min. We used to do the type facuet filters along with this filter outside trailer, but that gets old after awhile turning it on and off.Happy Rv Trails"
1655136,B005XVZKGA,I loved it!,"I love strong coffee and usually have at least 2 cups every morning.  I used to drink coffee all morning long, but now it bothers my stomach if I over do it.  Therefore, when I was offered a sample bottle of Vitality &aacute;vit'e caffeinated water, I took it.  I truly loved it!  It gave me the extra kick I needed to get me going after my usual 2 cups of coffee in the morning.  It is tasteless, and you get the healthy hydration of water with about the same amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee.  I don't plan to give up coffee any time soon, but I will definitely purchase a case of &aacute;vit'e for days I need an extra cup and don't want to risk upsetting my stomach."

1585678,B001EO5OKC,Gross!,"These berries are just gross. When I opened the bag, the odor turned me off immediately. Also, they aren't just dry, but rather like small stones. They made me think of the stuff you put in the bottom of fish tanks. Again, not something I was looking forward to eating.Their texture is again very dry. They feel like small pebbles in my hand. After tossing them into my mouth, and crunching a bit, they are very juicy. I'm not sure if I like the flavor because I'm thrown off by the nasty after taste, like grain. I don't know if you've ever smelled rabbit food or grain for horses. (I grew up with horses.) This is what the stuff smells like to me. Moreover, I imagine had I tried grain, it would taste like that: grain and berries. Gross.I got the pack of two so I could give a pouch to my sister-in-law for Christmas. I hope she likes the berries. Perhaps they would be better in smoothies, but I'm reluctant to try.If they didn't have the funky after taste, I'd like them better. Oh, and the smell. Gross."
1541331,B000CFJDWY,Very disappointed.,"I hate it when I can't give an organic food a strong rating. I depend a lot on the reviews of others here on Amazon, and consider them a very helpful tool. These crackers are not ""flaky"" or even crisp, they are just down right hard.  As others have stated, there are a high percentage of broken crackrs in every box. As someone who has to curb my use of salt, because I like it too much, I agree with other reviewers who found them too salty.  I have tried 3 other organic crackers here on Amazon.  We like Suzie's organic saltines a lot, but they have the highest breakage record.  Late July's Round Saltines aren't too bad, but our favorite so far has been ""Back To Nature's Saltines"".."

Oops! She's reading over my shoulder. I just can't wait for mine to get here.We are retired. Neither of us has noticed the extra weight or a balance problem. If you only use your XL a few minutes at a time, you probably don't need one of these. If, though, you plan to only play for a few minutes and check the clock and see that an hour has passed, then one of these might be quite helpful.The rounded grip part is large enough to keep our hands from cramping. If you are using a stylus for play the other hand is much more comfortable holding the entire unit. If you are using the control pad, the palms of your hands and fingers are more relaxed while your thumbs are playing.We haven't found a use for the stand (at least yet). The only negative is that the grip does cover the headphone port. Others have pointed out that some judicious carving can remedy that. We don't use headphones anyway.Well made, decently priced, comfortable to use - give it a try. We soon will have two in use."

You can go to the car door and press the action button and nothing happens.  The car chases are pretty bad, too.  You could be close to catching up to a car only to have it disappear.  Or you could be far from a car and it reappears.  The out-of-car experience is just as bad.  You could be coming towards an enemy and he will just stay put like he doesn't see you.  Overall, this game is pretty bad.  It feels like they rushed up to put this out.  If you want to play a decent Driver game, you should try Driver: Parallel Lines.

It can't be seen since it's behind the frame. Works fine but I shouldn't have had to do anything so it's pretty bad when you can't make something to fit what it's supposed to fit.

1440725,B002I0H09Y,Please don't buy this game.,"I should have listened to the reviews. I thought to myself eh, how bad can it be. It's a call of duty game so it shouldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong. It's so uncomfortable to play using the vita for starters and the game itself is just plain horrible. Believe me it's just plain horrible. I thought it would be ok and I dismissed the bad reviews and I regret it so much. Thank goodness I didn't pay full price for it but it still hurts that I paid any amount of money for this garbage. What on earth happened? I'm not going to go into details. Just believe me this is the worst cod game ever made. Even the original cod is better than this. If you can get this game for 5 dollars including shipping then by all means give it a shot. I mean for 5 bucks might as well but anything more would be a huge mistake. Not even for $5.01. Horrible horrible game. I'm just shocked the franchise would make such a terrible game.UPDATE AS OF 6/6/13....I finally got rid of this game. I couldnt take it anymore. This is the worst call of duty game ever made and I'm really positive it will be the worse of all time and there could NEVER be a worst version. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.PS. SAVE YOUR 5 BUCKS."

Look before you buy: few of these are Amazon-verified purchases, they are all just a couple of lines long, and all say similar things like ""I didn't think it was gonna work but then it did!"" Even the ""reviewers"" that have verified purchases have suspicious review history, either just that one item or the same collection of sketchy items e.g. porn novels and other NexGen products all posted within the last few weeks. I am guessing this means they were purchased by the same few people, either employees of the company or friends and family. And one reviewer's name was Mandy while the next was Candy. smh.The product itself might be mildly helpful, but look at the ingredients, they're natural herbs (green tea extract, magnolia bark extract, phosphatidylserine, forskolin, raspberry ketones, theanine, 7-keto-DHEA, GABA, melatonin, black pepper) that cost nowhere near $40 for such a small amount. And give me a break, what kind of company markets itself to be pharmaceutical grade when we are all here in the first place because we are looking for a natural product i.e. not a pharmaceutical. More like pseudo-pharmaceutical.Come on people, don't push this to the top of the bestseller list because of fake reviews posted by scammers from this NexGen company.

They also pretty much invented the ""music video"", which was more of a curse than a blessing, but they were innovaters nonetheless. The cover of ""Satisfaction"" is at least ten times better than the original, and the commentary of ""Jocko Homo"" is still briliant. The best new-wave album."

The feathered bristles don't damage your car's surfaces but still penetrate heavy snow.  I didn't find the brush too heavy at all.  Actually I enjoyed it's slight heft, as it helped the brush penetrate deep, heavy snow.  Use it's weight, people, don't fight it.  The extendable feature really came in handy for reaching every part of my Jeep's roof.  I finally took it out of my SUV now that I'm enjoying a southern California winter."
1826525,B000001F6A,Why do we never get an answer...,"&quot;Question&quot; is in a way the ultimate Moody Blues song, because the Moodies' music is constantly probing and pondering the meaning of our existence by asking hard or impossible to answer questions about life.But &quot;Question&quot; is just the tip of the ice burg. This album is bursting with beautiful songs, including the lovely &quot;And the Tide Rushes In,&quot; the foreboding &quot;Melancholy Man,&quot; the brilliant &quot;Dawning is the Day&quot; and the inspiring &quot;The Balance.&quot; There is one fairly cheesy song that doesn't live up to the rest: &quot;Tortoise and the Hare.&quot; But it is by no means bad, just not as good.This was the last Moodies concept album. The unifying theme, the search for identity, isn't as prevalent as that of, say, &quot;To Our Children's Children's Children,&quot; but it's there. Rather then learning as they grew old the secrets of their soul, middle age more or less brought an end to the insatiable youthful curiosity that so loaded these classic albums. As good as much of their later music is, it doesn't have that same philosophical quality. For that reason, this album (and the other old school Moodies albums) should be savored as genuine treasures."

Get a plug wrench with a foam insert that hold the plug, or you may end up wasting a lot of time fishing the plug out after you lose it in the plastic housing that surrounds that part of the engine.

3042829,B0017ANAZO,The New Women,"Warning:  minor spoilers ahead.I found this remake of the 1939 film The Women to be quite enjoyable.  I was worried that it was going to purge all the bitchiness of the original, but some of that remained, and it is quite witty and clever in other places and ways.Even though it makes about as much sense to me to compare the two versions of The Women as it does to compare Massenet's Manon to Puccini's Manon Lescaut or Puccini's and Leoncavallo's versions of La Boh&egrave;me with each other, I'm going to do that anyway.  I'll say up front that I think there is room for both versions.Contrary to what is implied in the trailer, the remake has more in common with the original than I had first thought.  It carries over several lines from the original, including two of the very best lines.  There are places where it is obvious that they are setting up to bring over one of the original wonderful lines and those sequences are lots of fun because of the anticipation that the line is coming.  The best line from the original (the one about the kennel), on the other hand, shows up with almost no warning and in a very different place, spoken by a different character.The film doesn't follow the original scene-by-scene by any means.  There are some unusual plot twists such as having the phone call Crystal Allen gets at Saks Fifth Avenue, which is how it is known in this picture (as opposed to the thinly-disguised Black's in the original), take place at, rather than behind, the perfume counter, so that the women who are ""creeping up on her"" (this phrase is not carried over) get to witness the call.  Also the manicurist, who is called Tanya rather than Olga in this version, is brought back toward the end for an interesting plot twist.  There is a fashion show although in this version it is part of the story and not just a divertissement.  While the implication is there in the original that the writer character played by Jada Pinkett Smith has an alternative lifestyle, they leave no doubt of that in this version.There are differences, of course.  Bette Midler plays the fairly small part of the Comtesse de Lave, who goes by a different name, although she acknowledges that sometimes people call her ""The Countess.""  While Buck (different last name, which I don't recall) is mentioned, nothing really comes of that subplot other than the implication that the Comtesse may end up making him husband number six.  Buck never gets involved with Crystal either.  The biggest change is the character of Sylvie (rather than Sylvia) Fowler, who does not gloat over Mary Haines' sufferings; she feels genuine remorse at having played a part in the publication of the story of the fight between Mary Haines and Crystal Allen.  She is loyal to Mary Haines throughout the film, even during the disruption in their friendship, and so she never makes friends with Crystal Allen.  In fact, it could easily be argued--especially on the basis of one of Mary Haines' lines--that Mary's relationship with Sylvie is more important to her than her relationship with Stephen.  Little Mary obviously thinks very highly of Sylvie as well.  Then again, this is much more a pro-woman picture than the original.  It was probably influenced to an extent by Sex and the City from what I gather (I haven't seen it), so it only makes sense that the women would take their relationships with each other very seriously.  Another difference is that there is one male character in this version although it is entirely possible that that character is at least played by a female.Accordingly, since Sylvie and Crystal never become friends, Sylvie is not involved in the scene in Crystal's bathroom.  That scene, now only involving Crystal and Little Mary, brief as it is, tracks the original more closely than any other part of the film, or maybe it only seems that way because Eva Mend&eacute;s has obviously studied Joan Crawford and her speech patterns and reactions in that scene very closely.  There is another superfluous and not really believable--or maybe it is, in a way, given the way things are nowadays--plot twist involving Crystal, who otherwise does not reappear in the film after the scene in her bathroom, that comes out during the closing credits.I thought it bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through the film, and perhaps that was because that was the place where it diverged the most from the original.  On the other hand, there were certainly places where I found the lines funny or where I was completely engaged in the film where those sections had nothing to do with the original.I don't follow modern films that closely so I'll avoid detailed comments on the actresses.  I'll simply say that I thought the acting was good throughout and I really liked the girl who played Little Mary.  I wouldn't say she was better than the original, whose character and acting style was very much of that period.  The one actress in this film whose work I am familiar with is Debra Messing, from Will and Grace, and I must say that she has amazing breath control as is evidenced by the final scene.  The trailer made it look as though her role was much more prominent than it turns out to be, possibly to take advantage of her being possibly the best known actress of any in the film.  She is very important in the heartwarming ending, however.  Some of the important characters from the original are missing, such as those played by Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine.  Thre is no divorce ranch so there is no Marjorie Main either.  I wish the wonderful Carrie Fisher had had a larger role.Anyway, aside from the little bit of time where the film bogs down in the middle, the two hours went by pretty quickly.  The Women is certainly a better film than the reputation it has garnered.  Comparing it to the original film, I probably would have only given it four stars.  However, since I think the film stands well on its own without reference to the very different original (which I also love), I'm giving it five."
1648013,B0054TWQMM,Worked well as an egg replacer in my gluten free baked goods.,"I decided to give Nutiva Chia Seeds a try when they were offered to me by Amazon Vine to review.First, I used them in my smoothies.  I normally use ground flax seed, but was pleased to find that these chia seeds have over twice the amount of omega 3 fatty acids in them than flax seed.  I ground them in my coffee grinder, resulting in a creamier smoothie.  I'm not supposed to eat small seeds due to a recent diverticulitis attack, and eating them ground has not bothered me. It also seemed to me that they were milder in taste than the flax seeds I had been using.Next, I decided to try it as an egg replacer in my gluten free baked goods.  Performance-wise, I could not tell the difference between chia and flax seed.  Because of the added nutrition, I will continue to use chia in baking, alone or mixed with ground flax.  I recently read a blog post that chia seed could also cut out the need for guar gum and xanthan gum in gluten free baked goods.  I'm going to try that next and see if I can adjust some of my recipes.  I'd rather not have to use the gums because they're expensive and they also bother a lot of people.  I'll post the results of my ""experiments"" and let you know how it goes!Update:  I decided to go ahead and try the chia without grinding.  I've been eating them that way for a couple of months now and haven't had any problems with diverticulitis. My favorite recipe is to fill a pint jar with Silk or SoDelicious coconut milk, add a packet of Stevita Supreme, a teaspoon of real vanilla extract (Tone's is GF)and add three tablespoons of whole chia seeds.  Mix well and set in the fridge for 1/2 hour.  Remove and stir well again.  Return to fridge for a few hours or overnight. Stir again before eating.  Tastes just like tapioca pudding to me!"

1595375,B001LQXUJK,Bought the 5 lb size and love it,"I decided to take a risk and try this in a 5 lb size even though I hadn't tried the product yet. I use a lot of honey for baking, teas, coffee, toast and oatmeal....not to mention the teaspoon here and there that I just have to sneak out of the jar and into my mouth. Anyway, this honey is rich flavored, maybe clover and buckwheat but it doesn't say on the jar, so I'm not sure. Just to mention, the texture is a little granular but the taste is superb. You can heat it to smooth it out, but then it's not raw anymore cuz it's been heated. I just deal with it and don't mind. I keep some smaller glass jars around to refill from this big jar and it works out perfectly for me. I will buy again because the taste is great and the price reasonable."
1294886,B0002DURNK,Pure nickel is where the tone is at,"We geetarists are a funny bunch: we'll change out pots and caps and pups from our axes and amps all day long, and spend a fortune doing it. But sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks!Case in point: pure nickel strings. Time was when that was all there was...and gee whiz, that was a time when good guitar tone ruled. Coincidence? Nope. These things just sound better, if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds. If you're used to wrapped strings, and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal, these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general. Especially if you use tubes.Tubes and pure nickel are like Gilmour and Strats or Angus and SGs. They just fit.I'm not nuts about Fender acoustic strings, but I like their normal electric strings fine, though Ernie Ball Slinkies have been my go-tos for many years. But these Fender pure nickels are very very nice, and at 4.75, they're a real deal. Most pure nickels run nearer to ten, and these sound pretty much the same, and I don't seem to break many of 'em neither. If you're used to mixed alloy, pure nickels might seem a little ""dull"", but wait a bit and you'll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded. Plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips. Try a set and see what I mean. It's subtle but it's beautiful.But the main reason I love these is for playing at VOLUME! I turned my modded Hot Rod Deluxe up to call-the-cops levels (the neighbors are getting used to it by now), louder than the drummer by a good chunk, and I got: less squealing, warmer tone by far, and full chords, triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string I've ever used. I think there's an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime. Check out BB's tone on the legendary Live At The Regal to hear what I mean. That's the stuff.So, if you haven't tried pure nickels, spend a buck or two more (or maybe less!) than you normally do and give these bargain-priced nickels a try. You might find that you're a convert within seconds. I know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up; those Zep and Jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel. And digging into some Otis Rush or Billy Gibbons licks is like night and day. The bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels.Hell of a bargain at less than five bucks."

1388197,B000P46NMK,Awesome Environment - Fun to Play,"The game has no real difficulty setting so I won't comment as to whether or not you will find it difficult or not - probably depends upon how many games you play and how well.  I will say that the interactive environment is one of the best I have seen and a major feature of fun factor in this game.  Almost any wall can be scaled and you can surf across rooftops as you like.The game has less of a strategy component than other RPGs and the mission style is pretty linear.  Every mission is some sort of assassination so they can become pretty repetitive.  Some of the later missions seemed much easier than I would have thought that they should be - especially in comparison to earlier missions.The story is pretty cool and draws just enough facts from history to remain plausible.  The graphics are great and controls not too hard to get used to.  My only complaint - and it is a common one these days - is that the ending is setting up for a sequel and nothing else.  The storyline doesn't end when the game does.Buy the game, have fun with the environment and try solving the missions in different ways.  I found, when I went back, that many missions can be accomplished in varying ways and some were much easier than others."
1303180,B005VM5Z5C,Ignore the tempting price - TOO SMALL for any guitar!,"Hi Folks! OK, this thing is cheap. That's cool. But a cheap item you can't use is money thrown away. Before buying this I had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it's too small. Well, I want to clear this up once and for all. IT IS TOO SMALL! Specifically, it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so (depending on your guitar), AND it doesn't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret, even on a skinny neck. This thing really is a puzzler. I mean, who the hell would make capos this size, especially when they could've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price? Someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid. HOWEVER, a positive from this whole mess is that I finally found a capo to use with my ukulele, and for way cheap, ha ha. But if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size, this is utter garbage. Cheers!"

In doing so you explore the town that Beavis and Butthead lives in and interact with many familure faces if you watch the show. Fun, yet, hard game to beat.

Granted, it is quite inexpensive and the consumer can only expect so much at this price point.  I have tested about a dozen of these containers sold at various retail outlets.  Not a single one could be tightened such that I was unable to squeeze air out of it.  While this may not be a problem for highly viscous oil, other more volatile compounds which may contaminate the oil could leak out.Ironically, you can purchase a similarly sized kitty liter container at Aldi for the same price.

1838314,B000002LFZ,"Powerhouse Team: Lindsey, Christine and Stevie","Fleetwood Mac went from being a little known blues rock group with tons of  admiration to the biggest pop/rock stars of the seventies and parts of the  eighties with the additions of Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and  Stevie Nicks.  Each of them brought not only personal ideals of music into  the group but enchanting rock songs that laid a spell on an era.  Let's go  through the selections of songs that each member is known for as  signatures.Buckingham is a brilliant guitar player with a great plucking  style.  The words of his music are often personal and very engrossing.  Lindsey is known for everything from heartbreak of &quot;Go Your Own  Way&quot; to a powerful combo of drums extravaganza that is  &quot;Tusk&quot;.  I personally really like the modern big pop twist on a  journey for Miss right on &quot;Big Love&quot;.  Not only are writings  introspectively great, but his playing really gave the group a great rock  sound that isn't to light or to soft.  His influence as a producer is felt  all over this collection.Christine really sent the group into the  stratosphere of pop hits.  Simple but elegant little nuggets of AOR  goodness like &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Over My Head&quot; are  cute accounts of romance yet very upbeat and not to encompassing.  Light  touches of eighties wonder are found on &quot;Everywhere&quot; and  &quot;Little Lies&quot;.  You wonder if the latter was about her  relationship with ex-husband and bass player John McVie after years of  divorce.  The songs have that simple quality of not being too much, but  making you think a little.  While you might find her pieces on love a  little bit thought provoking, something like &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is just  uplifting and positive with that great rock sound.Last but certainty  not least is the great little gypsy herself Stevie Nicks.  Her mesmerizing  arrangements captured something special in the band and the era of the  seventies.  Her music become some of the most intoxicating of the band's  with spooky sounds yet still staying very much into the groove of there big  rock/pop sound.  &quot;Rhiannon&quot; is darkly hypnotic and the guitar  arrangement reflects that.  This sound of sincerely fascinating lyric and  sound continued on everything the heart pouring &quot;Gypsy&quot; to the  light California rock of &quot;Dreams&quot; (most certainty about Lindsey).  She created a very unique sound with the group that can't be copied.  Listen to her solo records, which are worlds apart from this sound.Much  credit should also go to the great playing of founders Mick Fleetwood and  John McVie and their willingness to evolve with each record to sounds of  the seventies and eighties radio yet still keeping to their roots.  The set  is full of great rock songs that aren't too loud but aren't wimpy either.  The group has made a great pop rock sound that can't be duplicated.  A must  have set for lovers of the band and just anybody interested in the  seventies and eighties.  I do know that &quot;newer&quot; Fleetwood tracks  with &quot;newer&quot; members are no here, but those are honestly though  away.  The band lost it's edge big time when Lindsey left."
1299984,B0018TC3I4,A Complete Joke,"Don't buy this Chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand. It is barely workable for two.It is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place. And you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. For Les Paul and Strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. You can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. If you just gotta buy something from On Stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced. But really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.This is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for."
1859589,B0000634ID,Where has she been all my life?!,"This girl is amazing. A nice breath of refreshing amazing multi-talent that is absent in many of the acts of today's R&B/pop world. She is without a doubt different from and should not be compared to those other R&B/pop clones out there. For more reasons than just one, she reminds me of some of my other favorite talented singers out there like Jewel, Tracy Chapman, and India.Irie. She doesn't do measly parts in co-writing, she WRITES the songs and boy do the lyrics have intelligence and meaning! Things you can relate to, and no cliches that make you want to cringe. Some people may missunderstand her first single ""Oops (Oh My)"" as a dirty song without taking a second listen. It's NOT about sex, it's about feeling confident in the way you look which is something I can relate to. She sings well, is a percussionist, and my favorite trait of all- she PLAYS the guitar! How cool is that? I love how she's able to blend my two favorite kinds of music together- southern R&B and alternative rock. Each song sounds different from the next and you'll get a surprise each track. Every single song is great and the chill of her sweet southern voice adds a touch to it. My favorite songs are the ballad ""My Place"" and the alternative rock-based ""Hotel"". The only thing I could have done without was the presence of guest Bilal's irritating vocals on ""Best Friend""; it just totally ruined the mood. For all of you Ashanti-boppers out their, this album may not for you. This album is more focused towards a more mature audience that appreciates uniqueness and talent. I also really like Missy Elliot, so I did like her bonus track ""Big Spender"". It's really tight and has sort of a circus-like atmosphere. It sounds different from the rest of the album, though."
152849,B00BSDSDSO,A brand you can always trust,I like Spigen because they R&D; everything here in Bay Area CA. Also they're high quality build product from Korea. Those from China no where come close. I use this with Neo Hybrid case. The fitment is perfect. The 0.28mm is wayyy better than the old version 0.4mm. It also comes with 3 &#34;Home&#34; button sticker to raise up the Home button. Apply the glass itself is easier than my expect. However make 100% sure you're in a clear environment with you apply it. You've got ONE shot and that's it.It's a most have for every single smartphone on the market. $40 buys you confident and wayyyy less than replacing a broken screen.
191789,B00IX2VGFA,Excellent quality,"I received this product for review, and am delighted at the high quality of this cable. I can't have too many lightning cables. I have several Apple products that I like to keep charged at home, plus I like to carry a few with me when I travel or go to work. I've decided that this will be one that stays at home. It is the thickest of all my cables, very durable, and works to full effect. The length is just right--6 feet.I am able to charge my iPhone 5, which has an Otter Box Defender case (no problems with insertion), my iPod 5th generation, and my iPad 4th generation with a Bolkin case. The cable end that inserts is a little larger than the Apple brand one, but it caused no problems. I can sync and charge quickly. The price is higher than the Amazon cable (which I own and like), but it is much thicker, and worth the extra bucks. I use my Amazon cable for portable purposes now (because it is thinner, and therefore easier to store and takes up less room). For home, this one can't be beat."

3624086,B000ELUQQS,"Good idea in theory, but didn't work for us.","This thing sounded like a great product--only having to clean the box every two weeks (with two cats)? Sign me up! Unfortunately it didn't really work out, for a number of reasons.1. The cats really didn't like it. The noise and movement of it spooked them, so they avoided it most of the time. They also didn't like the crystal litter.2. Using this as the only litter box for two cats didn't work. Even though our cats seem to use their boxes interchangeably, once we made this one the only box one of the cats started to do his business all over the house. That may also be a side effect of point 1.3. Speaking of crystal litter, the stuff made a MESS. When they did use the box, they tracked it out and the stuff is painful if you accidentally step on it in bare feet. It also got between the ScoopFree box and our bamboo floor and scratched it.  :(4. The box isn't really any easier to clean than a regular litter box. It's heavy and a pain to move around (which you have to do to get the 'cartridge' out. We also found that we had to clean the 'containment' area at least once a week anyway because it would start to stink.5. We felt guilty using this thing because of all the waste you generate and throw away what with all the packaging material on the 'cartridges'. Also they're EXPENSIVE.The thing does work, but we eventually replaced it with our old two plain jane boxes and both the people and the cats are much happier. It's a little more work, but a much better solution. Now we have to figure out how to get rid of a used ScoopFree box."
2070518,1566053978,MST3K: Manos The Hands of Fate(1966),"In 1966, director Harold P. Warren tried to make a popular horror film with a low budget and failed! Over the years, Manos The Hands of Fate has become a cult classic. Mystery Science Theater 3000 brought this turkey back into the limelight. Even Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank apologize for making Joel watch it! In Texas, a traveling family are stuck at a house run by a satanic cult. The film's most colorful character is Torgo. Manos suffers from many technical and artistic flaws. The movie was filmed with a 16mm camera. All the voices are looped by two men and a woman. The acting is very broad and hammy. Warren tacks creepy music and R&B songs onto the movie. The lighting in the film is not good. There's a stock shot of a snake from a Walt Disney movie that looks better than Warren's footage! Footage of sexy, nubile women wrestling in their underwear is used as filler. The Rhino DVD version of MST3K: Manos The Hands of Fate has a chapter menu and an MST3K outtake reel as extras."

1379088,B000HKP88C,This Game Simply Has It All.,"Opening Statement...I know a lot of people don't like this game for the crudeness involved in it. But I think it is a great game with an endless amount of fun. I first purchased this game back when it first came out and played it until I beat it which is a job in itself. I thought the storyline was very cleaver and well thought of.Graphis...I think the graphics in this came are amazing in a big scale. I mean when you walk around looking at all the people you very rarely have people in the same area that look the same, I think the buildings the water everything from big to small is amazing. They all look real and have a good glare of realism to them as well. Overall I give the graphics 5/5Gameplay...The game play is pretty good. I mean there are endless posabilitis to what you can do with your character. All ranging from the single player to the muliplayer you can do an awful lot with this game, the gameplay is pretty straight forward not moving much from the older games so that is a good thing for people of the franchise. I rate this catagory 5/5Audio/Sound...I think this is a little lacking, The sounds of the guns sometimes don't fire, and sometimes i hear things that just don't make sense I mean I just can't put it together. Other then that the sounds of crashes and driving are all very good. I think they did a pretty good job with the whole game overall. I rate this catagory 4/5Final Thought...I think this game is a great one to have becase it deals with a lot of diffrent things you can do from single to muliplayer like I stated before. The graphics and audio are good as well. You can sit dowe and play this game for hours on end if you so well pelase to. There are many things ranging one what you can do. There are many weapons as well. This is a good game to have to play by yourself or to play with friends. I rate the game overall as a 4.5 out of 5.Go out and grab it!"

488130,B0091DS0U4,Love The Scent & Great 4X Cleaning,"This is a winning combination of a detergent.  First, it's 4X and it is super convenient, the polar opposite of the gargantuan jugs with spouts.  My wife would rather never see another one of those as, in our particular laundry room, they don't fit in the cabinet above the machines and they're ugly sitting on the machine.  So, this is the perfect solution...kind of like the iphone compared to an a first-generation bag phone.  This detergent is ""miniturized"" and packs a potent cleaning punch.  I get my shirts soiled and I've been favoring OXI treatment either in detergent or added.  This stuff doesn't need anything added when used as directed because my personal acid tests (my soiled shirts I wear in my repair business) come as clean as if I used additional OXI treatment.  Now, here's the run down:  stuff works, stuff is convenient due to 4X (use half or less), and the ""knock-out"" punch:  THIS STUFF SMELLS SO GOOD IT HARD TO DESCRIBE!  My wife and I think it may be the best smelling detergent we have ever used.  Keep in mind my wife is a GAIN acolyte.  So, next time instead of buying at that nameless den of alien hybridization big-box, spring for this and see if like us, you have just discovered a very winning detergent."

196665,B000052YBV,A Dentist Recommends This Product,"""Cushion Grip"" is a paste that is formulated to hold loose dentures in place for a long time - several days in fact (not that it is recommended to keep a denture in for days on end!).  Said another way, the paste has properties that allow it to remain retentive for several days.  I have recommended it to some of my denture patients (if they have a properly made denture, yet still need added retention).If you have to use excessive amounts of paste to keep a denture in, then the denture probably needs to be remade or relined (or perhaps an implant supported denture should be considered in cases of severe bone loss).konedog"

The band sounds kind of like an unmusical Iggy &amp; the Stooges.  There's a lot of sonic sludge over the course of the disc.  I didn't find anything I even halfway liked until track # 9, which is a little Pretenders-ish.  I spent less than half of the cost of a regular CD, but even then I felt like I wasted my money.  Two other comments: (1) It IS amusing that a band called the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have a song called &quot;No No No.&quot; (Even if the song is less than great.)

1879492,B0026NWBY2,For Services To Buskers Everywhere...,"Clear as crystal is George Harrison's problem - the Beatles split up; stranding him in that undesirable limbo cruelly but accidentally moulded for musicians who for many years fall between two stools - high acclaim and undreamt of wealth off the back of two far more prominent artists, and personal creative frustration for the same reasons.Harrison got the scraps from Lennon and McCartney's table - and it has to be said - understandably.They'd throw him a bone occasionally, pat him on the head, and allow him a cameo; the results of which - more often than not - were dire. I'm thinking in particular of that awful Velvet Underground-with-sitars drear fest: 'Within You, Without You' - for John and Paul it was welcome respite from the hating.So it's not really surprising that his solo work exhibit's the same failings magnified. The VU name-check is appropriate: take away Reed and Cale and what would you have?Likewise, Harrison was too full of his own beans, caught up in his own (in his eyes) underestimated part of that hysterical Fab Four myth; straining to be let loose but ultimately not having the sand or natural born to back it up.Admittedly, 'Let it Roll' could've been better selected, but the arbitrary, obliging quality of what is presented, quietly but firmly defines the concept of solo Harrison as the mediocrity it really is.It's the most irritating kind of music: neither toe-curlingly awful (except for the dreadful 'Got My Mind Set On You') nor momentous and up-lifting.It's a music that offers little, but expects plenty in return. It's so middle-aged, passive and harmless - and therefore far, far away from the real spirit of rock 'n' roll - that you hardly remember listening to it. It kind of floats away on a breeze of timidity, helplessly envious of storms elsewhere.A couple of songs pass: 'My Sweet Lord' is just about ok, 'Give Me Love' is worth a foot-tap but genuine moments here are few and far between.I still think he's better than McCartney, who I loathe with a savagery that frightens me, and he's never getting near Lennon; but surely even the most blinkered, buy-everything Beatles devotee won't be hoodwinked by 'Let It Roll' and will sensibly treat it to the wide-berth it deserves."
2290226,630414427X,Caravaggio Bizarro,"Michelangelo Caravaggio was an important Italian painter who led a short, tumultuous life.  He surrounded himself with earthy street people who became the models for his paintings.If you're looking for a biopic about the life of Caravaggio, look elsewhere.  This chaotic and bizarre interpretation of his life by avant-garde director Derek Jarman is like seeing art history on a bad acid trip.  The story opens well enough around the year 1600, but I thought I was seeing things when I saw a man in a tuxedo.  I scratched my head at the calculator, but the motorbike and truck were too much.  The use of anachronistic images and odd sound effects (trains, crashing ocean waves) was too jarring and distracting for me.  There was little dialogue, the range of accents included cockney and Irish, and the narration made no sense.As a fan of Caravaggio's work, I did enjoy the scenes that showed models posing for his famous paintings, but the rest - a montage of unrelated scenes showing his depraved lifestyle - was just distasteful and speculative. Tilda Swinton made an impressive screen debut in the puzzling role of a street woman and a very young Sean Bean is interesting as her companion, but Nigel Terry was an off-putting Caravaggio.  Not recommended."

1301608,B003D3OCD2,"Will fill a room, but has some quirks","I've been playing with my brother's Lunchbox and when he first plugged in for a jam at his house I thought he was joking. This amp can easily cut through drums, even in the close confines of his practice studio. Granted, I am not a heavy hitter, but we were messing around with come classic rock from the early 60s and this amp at three on the volume knob was plenty loud.The tone is very good, but not exceptional. It's not as clean as a Fender or Jazz Chorus, but it's still better than many of the amps I've listened to. If you want to make this a spectacular tome machine plug aBoss FBM-1 Fender '59 Bassman Pedalinto it.About the quirks. The ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb. It does give a hall-like sound as you increase it, but was designed to simulate an open back amp more than a true effect. The gain controls the input signal to the amp, and according to the manual is more like a soft overdrive. The volume level is solely controlled with the volume knob with the gain knob playing no real role in how loud the amp gets. Finally, the speaker switch on the rear is for turning the internal speaker on and off, not the speaker out circuit for routing the signal to an external cab. That means that you can use ths amp as a head by turning the 6.5 inch internal speaker off, or have it active with a cab as a set of external speakers in addition to the internal one.Plugging phones into the headphone jack will NOT turn off the internal speaker. You need to do that with the speaker switch. Personally I love that feature because you can also use the phones jack as an output to a PA with the amp's internal speaker still active.You definitely need to follow the instruction manual, and especially the advanced user's guide, or you may be initially disappointed. My brother returned the first unit he purchased because there was a pop when it was turned on or off, as well as a slight hum when it was idling. The replacement amp exhibited the same problems. However, if you follow the manuals (plural) you can prevent both problems. I mentioned quirks - the power on and off procedure and positioning the gain knob to the mid level are the keys to smoothing the amp out.Bottom line: this tiny amp packs a punch and has sound characteristics that have to be heard to believe. If you want true reverb you will need to plug in a pedal (check out theBoss FRV-1 63 Fender Reverb Pedalif you haven't already), but for small venues and practice rooms the ambiance feature is probably all you need. Do take the time to read the documentation before you start using it because when this amp is properly used it's simply amazing."

1819603,B00FX38B5U,Pros & Cons,"I like the simplicity of the design and the ease of use of this WORKSHOP Wet/Dry Vacs.It's powerful. It easily sucks up water as well as nails and even a drill bit. Great capacity (4.5 gallons)!The wands and tools snap into place easily and hold firmly with locking tabs. They come off easily, too by simply pressing the same tabs.I like the built in accessory storage. The vac comes with crevice tool, dusting brush and utility nozzle, but more tools (car nozzle, wet nozzle and floor brush) are available for purchase.It's a blower -- you can blow leaves, but you'll have to pick it up by the handle since there are no wheels. It has a nice long cord. The hose itself expands from 2 feet to 7 feet for a long reach. (Also handy for blowing dust out of radiators or out from under the refrigerator.)While I do like the box configuration, it does invite sitting or stepping on, but there is a warning stamped into the top, &#34;Warning: do not step, stand or sit on vacuum.&#34; And this warning is actually hard to see.When I first opened the package, I couldn't find the directions. They were in the storage compartment. With the vacuum facing me, all I had to do was pull up firmly on the storage compartment cover tab. The side of the box does show the covers in the lifted position.The instruction book is quite clear, but there was one aspect of using the wet vac that had me a little confused at first. Where is &#34;the float?&#34; I finally figured out how to remove the &#34;Qwik Lock&#34; filter (page 7 in instruction book) and I was able to see the float mechanism inside its cage. If you turn the top upside down, the float will drop. Instructions give a warning to &#34;not operate without filter cage and float, as they prevent liquid from entering the impeller and damaging the motor.&#34; But nowhere in the instruction diagrams could I find the float labelled.Getting the large white filter bag over the ribs inside the drum was a bit tricky, but I finally did it. Only one filter bag comes with this vac.This wet/dry vac is made from very sturdy plastic. I prefer this to a metal canister since metal tends to rust.I like this product. If I were in the market for a wet/dry vac, this one would definitely be a contender."
3753262,B001O0CC1U,Great deal for the price!,"See Update Below original 4 star review.(Original:) Unless you are taking your vehicle to the track, and have a need to spend $60-100 for a set of fancy locking lug nuts, these will suffice! I have used these on several vehicles without a hitch, and they are a great buy for the money. Only reason for rating 4 stars is that there is always a little play in using the lug adapter, which makes torquing the lugs a little bit more a pain.(Update:) The last set of these I received had a ""Dud"" lugnut in the batch... That is, that the threading was either of a different pitch, or not threaded properly. Fortunately I caught it before attempting to forcefully thread the nut on, possibly ruining the stud as well... When one lug would not rotate by hand onto the stud I tried it on several others without avail. Instead of risking the stripping of a stud, I attempted to thread it on my spare wheel carrier (suspecting that the threading may have just had a bur on it,) where it required I would estimate in excess of 30lbft to rotate any bit past 1/3 turn. I am unsure if the quality control has just gone down hill, or whether this was an anomaly, but this could mean bad news for someone who is less experienced with vehicle maintenance, or uses improper procedures such as installing with an impact wrench."

The show shot on Universal's back lot resembles  Medicine Bow on The Virginian. Yes, they used these sets in movies, TV shows and others but you have to have a keen eye to notice. I grew up with these shows because the western was the norm back then.  I wish there were a few new westerns on today.  Laredo took the western in a different direction.  It could be funny and serious at the same time. The characters work off each other as if it were natural. Brand with his raspy voice is great and Peter Brown was the ladies man.

On the couch the velcro-like pad picked up some of the hair, but the more embedded hairs stayed behind.  Where the cat hair was denser on the chair, it picked up clumps easily.  I was able to pull the hair off the pad easily, so each should last a few months (depending on usage, of course) before replacement is necessary."

1305429,B00000IODY,One of the best series of all time,"The Good: A lot of excelent guns, decent story with memorable characters, genius level design, tight controls and camera, varied objectives and localesThe Bad: Flimsy stealth, some levels are confusing, a little shortThird person shooters weren't very frequent on PS1 and when they did come by they were usually pretty bad. Syphon Filter proved that you can make this genre work on the PS1. The game is still really fun today and was way ahead of its time. A well done camera, great lock-on system, a decent story with memorable characters, a kick-ass arsenal of guns, and genius level design. Who would have thought a third person shooter would be this good in the late 90&#8242;s? Eidetic and 989 Studios did.You play as super spy Gabriel Logan who is a CIA agent trying to stop a dangerous terrorist named Eric Rhoemer. A Syphon Filter virus that targets specific DNA demographics has been created by a man named Phagan and it is up to you to shut down their operations and stop them from spreading the virus. You start out in New York with the streets being shot up by Rhoemer's thugs. There are objectives in each level to complete, but it is way beyond throw this switch, pull this lever, or shoot this amount of bad guys. You usually have to kill a certain amount of scientists, administer vaccines to victims, disarm bombs, turn off power grids. The objectives vary, but what is fun is figuring out how to get there.Syphon Filter has some of the most memorable levels I can remember. This is a game you play several times and remember where every enemy is, every crate location, and even how to kill each enemy. The levels vary with stealth sections, climbing, and timed areas. The game features a smart lock-on system because there is no camera control. It is surprisingly smart and follows you wherever you go. Enemies wearing flak jackets can only be taken out with head shots or very powerful weapons. This requires aiming in first person mode and taking them out. This flak jacket element is a staple of the series and will go on to be in every game. It is actually an element all on its own and not just body armor for you or the enemy. You can die very easily and if you don't stop and aim for head shots you will waste ammo and/or die very quickly.There are a couple of boss fights thrown in such as a helicopter midway and Rhoemer himself at the end. I found all gameplay elements to be evenly tossed up so you are never bored. The stealth elements need a bit of work and are probably the worst thing about the game, but it is very minor. Crouching and sneaking around works fine, but enemies tend to see you at unknown distances. Maybe a line of sight cone on the radar would help this. You also have to get in head shots otherwise they won't die right away and alert other guards.Weapon selection is also a bit flimsy because you have to hold down select and use L2 and R2 (strafe buttons) to select the weapon. I would have preferred a radial menu instead. Some levels can be a bit hard to navigate are too dark to see. Thankfully you get a flashlight you can equip because some levels are nearly pitch black. I found myself lost a few times because even though the level design is fantastic, some levels can look the same with confusing hallways and misplaced crates and boxes.I actually learned about weapons as a kid from this game. Real world weapons are in here and some that I have never seen in any other game before. The weapons are almost a character all on their own because they feel so good to shoot in the game. The K3G4 will cut through flak jackets easily and is probably the only weapon that will do this. The G18 is a super fast sub-machine pistol, while the silenced 9mm is a staple of the series. The shotgun, combat shotgun, PK-102, BIZ-2, Nightvision Rifle, .45, HK5, and a few more are all excellent weapons. It was also the distinct sounds the developers used that make these guns so memorable. The game has a great sniper scope that was unseen in games back then. There are grenades and gas grenades which are great for taking out a group of enemies stealthily. There are a lot of great weapons in the game and they are very memorable unlike most shooters.While the game itself is amazing the graphics were pretty good at the time. Looking pretty realistic art wise, the game had some good lighting effects and a lot of detail everywhere. I also have many fond memories of this game as a kid. I actually accidentally rented Silent Hill because I forgot the name of this game. I got all the way to the Pharcom Warehouse levels and had to turn the game in. I rented this game many times over and played it to death as a kid. I purchased it a few times here and there and every time I play this it brings back fond memories. Syphon Filter is one of the greatest games ever made and every gamer should play this masterpiece."

1478225,B004LM37FI,Atrocious,"You know that rule about comic book movie adaptations that have really bad tie-in video games?  Yeah, that's in full effect with Thor: God of Thunder.  From the same crew that was behind Sega's two Iron Man games (and the upcoming Captain America game), Thor puts you in the boots of the titular God of Thunder as he takes on Frost Giants and other assorted baddies, in a style that is pretty much a quasi-God of War ripoff.  That in itself would only make the game monotonous, but combine that with the dated graphics engine (it looks like an early PS2 game), buggy gameplay, and horrible controls, and you have a game that is flat out atrocious.  Actors Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, who portray Thor and Loki respectively in the film, sound like they're both half asleep, and the game as a whole feels like it was so rushed out of the gate that it comes off as being unfinished.

Usually they have good taste butI cant fathom why would they praise garbage like thisespecially when it's as unoriginal as a Friday the 13th sequel.Yet some of these film critics praise ""The Football Factory""a violent look inside Football in the UK through a bunchof dsyfunctional fans.The film's plot is that virus (yes like night of the living dead and romero's flick ""the crazies"") has infected many area of the uk. jim (cillian murphy) is apparently the only dumb smuck not infected along with a girl named selena (naomi harris). well from here on out these two dimwits and their friend mark now fight of zombies i mean rage people with bats and a machete. lolIn order for the idiotic danny boyle to not appear as he is copying romero (which he does anyway), he invents a new plot in middle. see the virus infects people and takes over within 30 seconds, whereas romero's zombies start reacting after an hour or so of being dead.We get some shots of london and manchester but those shots didnt matter as the film is a mess. not even an entertaining mess, its just plain doggy doo.There is another rip of ""dawn of the dawn"" when jim, selena and their new friends frank and hannah, scourged and plunger an abandonded supermarket to their hearts contents. this is reminiscent of the abandonded shopping plaza where the ""survivors"" exploit the plaza while the zombies on the outside are trying to get in. what a rip. another scenes that rips of romero is where boyle for shock value has a young boy who has the disease attack jim. the scene ends with jim getting a baseball bat and killing the boy. this wasa bit of copy of the dead films like the first one where we see the first zombie  girl in a zombie movie (the girl kills her mothers, then girl is killed herself).Well the copying of Romero doesn't end there because Jim and others find a military complex which is really an abandonded plaza where Major West (Christopher Eccleston), an arrogant military commander attacks the rage people.Well the rip here is that West like Dr. Logan (from Day) has a zombie, I mean rage person on a leach trying to the dead thing new tricks. LOL My god as you can very well see ""28 Days Later"" is a such rip of the great Romero it ain't funny. However, it's such a poor ripoff  of the work of Romero that the movie fails at every level.There is hardly any suspense, until the last 10 minutes, the characters are horrible including Jim who by God is one of the ugliest actors I've seen. The ending is cheesy and dumb.Mr. Cillian Murphy and others do such a poor job of acting that it's hard to fathom that this guy will play a big lead in the next Batman movie (""Batman Begins"").Don't fall for the lies of the critics that say 28 Days Later is a good movie, it's not, it's horrible.I went to see this horrible ripoff with low expectations and I came away still in awe that such a bad movie could be made.There is no more to say or add to this review of ""28 Days Later"" than to say it's horrible, horribly done by a European director, and poses a black eye to any future horror directors from the UK.At least George Romero can still rest comfortably that his great work of the ""Dead"" trilogy will not be eclipsed by any wannabee horror directors anytime soon.I didnt mind the copying so much if the movie had a greatpayoff sadly it never does some people may bash this opinionbut it doesnt change the fact that its an awful film unworthyor your energy."

1864178,B00009VRDI,And I Thought Chapter I was Crap.,"Ashanti to me is so boring and medicore. I brought &quot;Ashanti&quot; during the rush for a cheap price. I expected it to be 'good'? because so many copies were being bought. Well at first I did think it was okay. Then the rush was over, and I realised the real quality of the CD. &quot;Ashanti&quot; had good songs -&quot;Foolish&quot;, &quot;Baby&quot;, &quot;Voodoo&quot;, but overall was disappointing. Now &quot;Chapter II&quot; -again bought during the rush. It's the manufactured 'artistes' like Ashanti that make real artistes unknown. Now &quot;Chapter II&quot; is like ten time worse than her debut. &quot;Rock Wit U&quot; is like the most lame song/single ever. I can't believe she even released it. It's so boring. And it is the best track on the album. Ashanti is just copying Mary J Blige and failing. The album is a perfect example to the downfall of R&amp;B/Hip-Hop. Honestly how could something so lame, boring and manufactured be soul? Now Murder Inc. You guys should just give up. It's like a family affair -on one CD. Like you don't need all the crew here on one album -we all know Ashanti is ya crappy record label's princess. And just because a chic -Ashanti's friend says to Gotti:&quot;Man that joint is hot. It's off the chain. She did it again!&quot;Well that is hard to believe is honest. And also another thing to Ivr Gotti - Your laugh on every track is like... annoying. And also swearing and cursin': &quot;Mutherf**ker&quot; doesn't make u tough...I anticipate on Chapter III -can't wait for another bitchin' session."

Had an auto detailer look at the damage before getting it fixed, he asked what product caused it and I told him &#34;ScratchX 2.0&#34; - he replied &#34;Oh, I would never even use that stuff, it's too abrasive.&#34;Bottom line, from my experience with this product: do not purchase it under any circumstance unless you are very experienced working on cars.This is truly a one star item. Avoid at all costs."
1289779,B00KA7JIII,Very well done,"I seldom feel compelled to write a review and rate an app, especially when there's no prompt to do so within one. This is an exception. Despite only having about 90 minutes of play time, it's worth the four bucks.Imagine maneuvering a set of Escher drawings. That's essentially what you're doing here, altering a landscape so your character can go where it couldn't before. There's also a bit of soothing background music.This will appeal to the same people who like The Room and its sequel."

1298448,B000EEN9OG,Great effects pedal for the money,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-2 Overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues....  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is &#34; It tends to be a little noisey &#34;  if you turn the gain up too much.  You can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have.  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."

1489947,B0050SYQLG,"Amazing, Generation Defining Game",Forza 4 is a once in a generation racing game and will go on to define this console cycle. I cannot heap enough praise upon this game. One of the rare video games that offers amazing value at any price.
1442029,B002I0HD9G,Bugged and Broken Beyond Reason...,"I've been playing Atari games for nearly 3 decades, and I have to tell you - there's no way that anyone with more than a year's worth of programming experience lent any effort to this title.This game is horribly broken.  Terrible driving mechanics, passable graphics at best, a completely worthless club system, and much, much more stands between Test Drive Unlimited 2 and anything worthy of being called a ""massive online racing game.""With only about 8 hours of playtime under my belt here, I'll admit that I'm going to hold out for some repairs (not patches - flat out repairs) to be made, and hopefully things will get better.  But the cars drive like air balloons, the trucks are actually somewhat decent...  The graphics are gorgeous inside the dealerships, but in the open-world environment of TDU2, we're subjected to Grand-Theft-Auto car detailing, such as octagonal-shaped steering wheels, clipping, and terrible anti-aliasing.  Match that with driving physics that tries to mix something like Ridge Racer and slot-cars, complete with unpredictable drifting, a ""forward to reverse, reverse to forward"" that literally gets STUCK, and you've got TDU2.The worse travesty is the part of the game which TDU2 centers on - the online interaction.  Weeks before the game released, the TDU2 forums were alive with people starting their clubs, recruiting members, and anxiously awaiting the game.  Now released, a majority of gamers who have tried to create their clubs have had frozen screens and corruption of their file-saves.  Once recovered (by unplugging the internet, rebooting, and moving to a different spot on the map) these users discovered that their clubs either didn't exist, or existed but were unmanageable.  All attempts to access the club area of TDU2 results in a frozen game.Add in the fact that you can't (easily at least) sell cars, the ""custom"" options are extremely limited, the photo and graphics editors are total jokes, and it becomes safe to say that TDU2 is the first colossal let-down of 2011.  Don't worry, Atari - there is plenty of time left for someone to suck more than you...It's unspeakable to pay this kind of money and be presented something still well within the stages of beta-testing.  It's an insult, and I strongly suggest that gamers stay far away from this title until these issues are resolved (IF they get resolved...)  Stay tuned to this review - I'll do my best to keep it updated.*******First revision (keep up the negative votes, fan-boys.  I don't really care.)Three days since release and the online components still aren't working.  Newest issue I have - the game won't even load past the opening menus.  I've again had to unplug the internet to get the game to load.  (Yes - the ONLINE RACING GAME works best when you DON'T use the internet...)Complains on the TDU2 forums are reaching a fevered pitch.  I'd suggest stopping there if you're still considering purchasing this title.As far as gameplay goes, the game is still fun, if not a bit too easy (read my response to one of my laughable comments below.)  AI doesn't really try at all, and you'll only lose a race if you mess up.  Of course, the physics don't help much.  I've grazed a wall at a high speeds to be viciously spun 360-degrees without reason...  At least it left me pointing in the same direction.Still hoping I can get my club going, as online support is actually quite high.  Stay tuned...*******Second RevisionI'm glad to see that the average star-count for this game is dropping.  About time people start recognizing the reality.One week after release now and several of the bugs have been fixed.  A freeze on load-up has been fixed and online play seems to be stable.  However the club function is still not working - they keep bringing the ""club server"" online only to find more problems that need fixed.And another nasty bug persists - people getting ""your game is corrupted and you have to start over again"" messages.  In fact, even I've fallen victim to this now, after 50+ hours of gameplay, winning a car in the casino (which is NOT easy to do) and driving every road in the first island...  ...I have to start over again.Except that I won't.  This game is probably getting returned.  I've dropped my review to 1 star - this game is essentially unplayable.If you want a ridiculously easy single player campaign with graphics a few years behind their times with pathetic voice acting - all bundled up with iffy driving physics and the overlying possibility that you could lose hours and hours of effort for no reason whatsoever, by all means, pick up Test Drive Unlimited 2.  At some point you'll be sure to regret it!"
1347986,B0000TSRA6,BAH WHATEVER,I did not like this game compared to the others for seeral reasons 1 reoccuring enemies every time you go in a room kill all the enemies leave turn around and come back there they pop up again exactly how they did the first time and guess what you have to kill them all again while your ammo is rapidly depleting which gets to my second reason for not enoying the game. 2. You would figure in a game with a reoccuring enemies they would have plenty of ammo WRONG! and thats not even the worst part. Most of the ammo you get is a diffent caliber than the one to the gun your using so you cant use it until you either find that gun or one of your pals who has it. Just imagine dealing with this kinda crap when zombies keep coming at you and you cant go back in the previous room without dealing with the same ones all over again. 3. Same oldstyle outdated movements of characters as the very 1st Resident Evil which is almost 10 years old.  OVERALL just a frustrating game especially for single play. RESIDENT EVIL 4 ROCKS THOUGH!
2945078,B000NOK1KC,Reality,"Good storyline. Based on true events. Gripping reality of challenges within LA projects and the zeal of a &#34;real&#34; teacher, not one that just sits behind a desk waiting on the class to be over."
870353,B008FP92BK,Garbage.,"I don't know where to begin...Controls need some serious work, the game play is chaotic with mode changes that occur WAY to often, the high scores should NOT be set so high by default (should be zero), and the speed of the game does not allow any thinking of how to handle each 10 second section.  Garbage, but not totally trash.  Worth a try for free, but don't bother otherwise."
25597,B0040Z1EHY,Sounds like a steal!,"After moving recently, I discovered that my headphones went the way of the Dodo. The wire had snapped, and they were too fine to repair. I was upset; I only had them for a few months.Thus I needed to find a replacement pair to use with my iPod Touch. While my previous pair worked great, they were also corded, which meant finding some place to wrap the wire as I walked around the house cleaning. Thus, I decided to shop for some wireless Bluetooth headphones.Amazon had these listed for less than $30. Combine that with being a Prime member and I had my new headphones, the Arctic P311s, by the following day. Now, the reviews on the Amazon site indicated that these headphones were great quality for a low price. Especially as I am not aware of the Arctic brand. Below are my impressions:ConstructionThese headphones feel durable. They are not heavy, and the overall impression is one of good quality. The ear pads are soft without being too bulky, and the plastic of the frame is smooth without any burrs or defects. When worn they slip over the ear comfortably and rest along the base of the neck (these are designed to be worn behind the head, rather than on top like a traditional pair).The buttons are large enough to be found easily and depress noticeably so that you know that the required command is executed. The power button is large and lights up to indicate its status: red when charging, blue when connected, and flashing red/blue depending upon syncing or connecting to your device.These headphones are also designed to fold up and go into the accompanying hard case; this part is a little awkward at first, but once you get the hang of it they are well-protected. There is even room for the USB charging cable. In regards to the charging process, the headphones charge with a mini-USB cable; the port on the headphones is under a small piece of rubber which protects it when not in use. The other USB end fits into any USB slot on your computer/hub for charging.UseI purchased these headphones for use with my iPod Touch, as explained above. I have a 4th generation iPod that supports Bluetooth devices. As a caveat, this headset can also be used with my Android cell phone, as there is a built-in microphone. That being said, I have only used these for my iPod and I cannot attest to the sound quality of the microphone.Syncing the device to my iPod was a breeze, with only a minor snag of the iPod not finding the device at first. Before you can sync the headset, you need to charge it for a minimum of 2 (two) hours. The instructions also state to keep the headset on the charge for the first couple of days to ensure the best battery life. I keep them plugged in to the USB port when I a finished using them.To sync, you just need to hold down the power/call button for about 6 (six) seconds, until the light on the headset is flashing red/blue in rapid succession. This puts the headset in discovery mode. On my iPod I went to Settings-->Bluetooth (turned it on)--->Find devices. After my iPod found the headset, it appeared in the menu as P311. I touched the entry for the P311 to connect the device with my iPod; it went off without a hitch. All of this took maybe 2 (two) minutes, tops.The initial volume setting is LOUD! My music blared in my ear and I had to hurriedly turn down the volume. I clicked the button on the earpiece and the sound volume went down appreciably. Some electronics have a volume function that is barely perceptible; the Arctic P311 headset bucks this trend by having discernable volume levels.I am not an audiophile, so I cannot give you a technical explanation of the sound quality. This being said, I find the sound to be awesome! The bass level is not too high and the music is clear and undistorted. There was no interference at all! I was able to move my head and also to walk around without any static or other noises. Even sitting next to my computer speakers there was no issue.The music was not distorted; the singing was clear and you can even make out the melody/harmony lines within a song. The sound quality remains excellent even at extremely low or high volumes. In short, while not the quality of Bose, you will be pleasantly surprised (especially with the awesome price!).OverallIn short, this headset is well worth the $30 that I paid to Amazon. These are a good quality Bluetooth headset that is comfortable to wear and has great sound. They are also convenient as the enclosed carrying case will protect your headset should you wish to travel with it. They charge to full capacity within 2 (two) to 3 (three) hours, and the battery life is roughly 7 (seven) hours. Thus, a full charge could get you through a standard work shift.If you would like an economical pair of Bluetooth headphones, whether to listen to your iPod, Android device, or even your Windows-based computer, this product is for you. It is comfy, has great sound quality, stores easily within the accompanying carrying case, and most importantly is moderately priced. Highly recommended!"

1572773,B00112CND8,Great gluten free flour!,"I have been gluten free for 3+ years, and have tried many substitutions for regular wheat flour. None measure up to this mix. I have mixed my own using Bette Hagman's recipes, and I've used Bob's, Arrowhead Mills, and Pamela's multipurpose blends...this is the only one that produces the feel (aka, 'crumb') of 'normal' foods. I have found that I do not like the taste of bean flour, and this Authentic Foods blend is free of bean. I have a buttermilk pancake recipe that I use this in; they come out so delicious that even if I could eat wheat, I would keep making them with this flour. Love this stuff, and I love not having to keep 10 bags of individual flours in my fridge. I won't be without it!"
1831606,B0000029AP,"Aerosmith's 2nd best album behind ""Rocks""","THE BAND: Steven Tyler (vocals, keyboard, harmonica), Joe Perry (guitar), Brad Whitford (guitar), Tom Hamiliton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums & percussion).THE DISC: (1975) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 37 minutes. Recorded at the Record Plant, NYC. Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout containing band pictures, assorted pictures of single ""45""-records, copies of hand written documents from the time, and thank you's. Originally released on Columbia Records, this one is 20-bit digitally remastered (""limited edition"") by Sony/Columbia in 1993.COMMENTS: Aerosmith had small successes with their debut ('73) release as well as ""Get Your Wings"" ('74). No one studio album of theirs matched the success of ""Toys In The Attic"" (8+ million copies sold). ""Toys"" was a versatile and inventive album. Mega hits (right in line with the band's biggest hits, ever) with ""Walk This Way"", and ""Sweet Emotion"". Mild hits with ""No More No More"" and the title track. An R&B; workout (silly as it is) with ""Big Ten Inch Record"". A power ballad with piano and orchestra with ""You See Me Crying"". The deep album cuts are perhaps some of my favorite Aero classic rock tunes... ""Adam's Apple"", ""Uncle Salty"" and the pre-grunge ""Round And Round"". Decades later, you can still hear several songs from this album on the radio, as well as seeing them perform many of these songs live at their concerts. If I had to choose one Aerosmith album to take with me on a trip, two out of three times it would be ""Rocks"" (1976). The other one time would be ""Toys"". A classic album (5-stars)."
1574936,B00142I7BM,Yummy healthy snack,"Got the variety pack for Christmas, since we are trying to eat healthy.  So many packaged items have added sugar, preservatives & other ingredients.  Recently discovered I have many food allergies, so my meal options are greatly reduced.  These are crunchy, convenient, and taste amazing.  Ordering more -- esp. the pineapple.  As a comparison, I also got some Sensible Foods cherry berry.  Those also taste good, but the pieces are much smaller and harder to eat."

1341136,B00008JOLW,Amazingly Fun!,"Age of Wonders is fun for reasons I don't understand.  It's likeCivilization 3andLords of Magic: Special Edition (Jewel Case)combined.  If you're scratching your head right now I'll give you a clue.Imagine you are the Wizard-President of an empire filled with people who can ONLY-LIVE in a certain element, such as desert.  Your people literally DIE in any other environment.  So what is a Wizard-President to do?  How about CAST A SPELL THAT EXPANDS THE DESERT TO THE EDGES OF YOUR EMPIRE.  That's right!  Your desert will LITERALLY push it's way right up to your competitors Snowy, Watery, or Green-Grassed borders.But Shadow-Magic adds even MORE to the mix.  Because the Shadow-Magic races are like Reality-Eaters from the Void.  So playing as them, instead of trees growing (life) or ash falling from the sky (fire/death) holes begin tearing in the map revealing the bones of reality underneath and as time passed, bonus units will crawled out.  I don't know why they didn't add the bonus units feature to all of the Element-Map Variants.Overall the gameplay could be improved to allow endless expansion of cities and even MORE elemental customization of the maps if they're going to release an Age of Wonders III, but with the latest created in the PC gaming world, an Age of Wonders III wouldn't have that much to worry about.The bottom line is if you've never watched your Element (Ice-Snow, Fire-Lava, Death-Ash, Life-Grass, Water-Swamp) spread out from your one city and cover the world, then you haven't truly lived.  Age of Wonders is everything that Civilization is not.One thing I forgot to mention is the bonus your units receive from fighting on their element, in fact some creatures, like the Fairy-Dragon are LITERALLY invisible on their element whereas others simply gain regeneration."
2135725,6301303024,Drivel,"Yes, the title &quot;D-Day the Sixth of June&quot; is irritatingly  misleading.  This movie spends most of its time chronicling the tawdry tale of a married U.S. military officer who has an affair with a British USO-type woman who is engaged to be married to a courageous British officer.  The battle scenes are sporadic, and the story creaks along slowly.  The handsome Robert Taylor and the beautiful Dana Wynter are basically wasted because their roles are so unsympathetic.  The characters that they portray have few qualms about cheating on their loved ones.The movie also is not helped by a repetitious, sappy musical score that includes the sentimental song &quot;You'll Never Know (How Much I Love You)&quot; which accompanies the illicit lovers as they unapologetically indulge in their affair.&quot;D-Day the Sixth of June&quot; is strictly for diehard fans of Taylor or Wynter. And perhaps not even those fans will be able to swallow this drivel."
1674347,B00APKBFFY,Fakey Bacon and No Cheese,"This side contained bland pasta swimming in a watery white sauce that tasted of strongly of bacon. It was so pronounced and harsh it tasted fake, even though the ingredients list bacon as an ingredient. If there was any parmesan in there, we certainly couldn't taste it. The noodles had a weird texture, somewhere between hard and rubbery. It was too salty.On the positive side, it is quick and easy to prepare. The package contains two servings so you don't have to worry about leftovers or insuslting the dog.If your idea of gourmet is a school cafeteria or an very bad all you can eat buffet, you probably will like this.  But for the investment of little more time, you could prepare a pleasing fettucine dish with an enjoyable sauce."
3581673,B00J4LMHMK,"Derivative, poorly-acted, cliched sci-fi that wouldn't even hold up on TV","I'm not sure why this is rated so highly on Amazon - it's a fairly derivative sci-fi B-movie that borrows heavily from other and better films in this genre. At a little over 90 minutes, it drags along with wonky CGI, risible dialog and non-existent character development. I felt bad for the actors having to do their best to make anything of this.Every possible cliche is jammed into the plot, from the scientist ""I'm only doing this to save my daughter"" routine to the innocent child-like robot being forced to do bad things and then ""falling in love"", to the cringe-worthy ""This is her consciousness, her soul!"" line - and let's not forget the demented lady looking for answers about her son. Add in a generous mix of evil government characters doing evilly, governmentally things and it's the sort of rehashed crap that even TV shows wouldn't dare try out these days.There's some artsy cinematography that tries to disguise that it was clearly shot in a parking lot but the production standards really don't hold up. The lighting is bad and the 80s synth soundtrack is dreadful (Vangelis it ain't). There are some murmurings comparing this to a Blade Runner prequel but that's just an insult to a classic that doesn't even warrant considering. This might be passable if you literally have nothing to do for an hour and it was free on Netflix but there's nothing here to remember even a few days later."

I don't have to tell you all what you already know about Sonny Rollins and this classic release.  We are all lucky Sonny Rollins has stayed with us so long and shared with us so much.  I'd just like to use this public space to thank Sonny again personally for his kindness in taking the time after a fabulous energy-draining virtuoso performance at Kannai Hall, Yokohama, in May '97, to sign this CD and take photos with me and a friend.  These treasures make me proud.  Thank you Sonny."

Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate.  I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night, 01/23.2014.  Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time.  Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue.  Other than that, they are a great, powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you.  Be safe and maybe look for another type of light that will give you longer service life before you spend the money on these."

3755401,B002RWK9N2,Not as Quiet as My Honda. Not Happy.,I purchased the Yamaha because of the good reviews and I'm a Yamaha fan owning a few products like my ATV. I had a Honda EU2000i that was 3 years old and I sold it with a travel trailer but now I felt I should of kept it. First thing I noticed when the Yamaha arrived was it seemed louder then the Honda but I thought I was being to critical. So later we went camping at my favorite spot in the desert and after placing the yamaha 30 feet from trailer where I would put the Honda I noticed the Yamaha was louder. With The Honda I could barely hear it when im in the trailer but the Yamaha was not as quit and I could easily hear it running. I was hoping it would be the same but because it's louder Im not happy at all so I sold the Yamaha and now looking to get another Honda...but dang it... Amazon is out of stock on the Honda... so Im of to Camping world.I would not recommend this generator if you want the most quietest one...but if the sound isn't an issue then it's comparable to the Honda.

1367657,B000BLM5PG,Shameless plagarism - I LOVE IT!,"As with other reviews, it'd be easy to begin with gameplay comparisons to GTA, as there's no doubt THQ programmers 'borrowed' many elements from Rockstar's staple franchise... But so what? Many development houses learn from their peers and try to improve on its awesomeness - or just try to match it. If comparisons to GTA must be made, aside from stock GTA gameplay elements, it's probably most akin to GTA San Andreas. Specifically the gang turf block wars section where you fight gangs on the street or complete missions to convert blocks of the city to your colors.Saints Row is all about respect. You perform minor missions (called activities) such as escorting hookers or creating carnage on a big scale and this gives you respect - get enough respect and a main mission will open up. Complete a main mission and the block is yours - earning you cash every week. The storyline is usual fodder for these sorts of games - rival gangs are in your turf and you have to defeat them - by destroying their music HQ, stealing their drugs etc.In graphics are considerably improved over the GTA franchise. Stunning view distances, burning vehicles create haze, water looks incredible, and the architecture is almost on par with PGR3 in places. The cut scenes especially show the engine off - with depth of field blurring and nice sfx. Sonically things are equally good - no complaints.So I'm about 9% in (around 7 hours) and loving it. I like to drive around and check out the scenery - do what I want when I want and Saints Row let's me. (Sadly I keep driving around looking for unique jumps!). So yes - it's a GTA type game. It's great fun and looks 1,000 times better than its inspiration.Had rockstar released a GTA game for the 360 I would probably not rate this game as high - but for now it's well worth your money and should tide you over until GTA4 comes out. Go get it bro!"

1296406,B0002GYYD6,Great sounding reverb.,"This is a great-sounding reverb pedal. Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep, rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). The design is very solid, and the controls are quite easy to use. Honestly, I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much, but there's no problem with them being there.I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon, U2, etc. Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones, this is it. This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals, but this one definitely suits all my needs."

They taste like toasted copier paper with a stingy dusting of sugar and salt.  I definitely do not want another bag of them any time in the foreseeable future.  And I have 39 bags to go.

It also has a little hook built in near the base so my guy can hook it to his belt when his hands are full.All in all it has done everything we wanted so we are pretty happy.  We also have an 18v Makita at the store that works great, but is much bigger and heavier (and more powerful).  They are both great, but the Milwaukee is plenty strong for most applications and it's size is a virtue.  Almost forgot...it has a light that comes on when you pull the trigger.  It would be nice if the light could be switched on independently, but is still nice to have regardless.  We usually use a flex bit on the drill so it's usually a moot point anyway because the light only shines straight ahead."

3061753,B001CC7PM6,Slow-paced but sizzling film noir,"""Road House"" (20th Century Fox, 1948)Although Cornel Wilde had top billing, Richard Widmark steals the show as a twisted man driven mad with jealousy -- so mad that he frames his best friend in order to keep him from getting away with ""the girl"".  She, of course, is an ice-cool Ida Lupino, in one of her best acting roles as Lily Stevens, a world-weary nightclub singer who comes between two friends, even though she initially resists both their advances.  Although the film moves slowly, it has plenty of atmosphere and some tart dialogue, made even better by the laconic, offhand delivery.  Lupino's character, especially, is one of the best cynics ever onscreen -- and she sings a lot, too!  This was only Widmark's third feature film, and he's the one to watch, as he works his way up to some serious scenery chewing at the end. Although he became a familiar, frequently typecast character actor in the 1950s, it's fun to see him here in his fresh-faced youth.  Both he and Lupino had a remarkable modernity to their work; in this film he reminded me quite a bit of Steve Buscemi, while Lupino is in a league all her own.  Definitely worth checking out, particularly if you're an Ida Lupino fan. (Joe Sixpack)"

1375254,B000FW4OHS,"Dungeon Crawl with Little Reward, Creativity","Children of Mana is the latest Squenix addition to a long line of Mana RPG/adventure games that have moved into the Nintendo handheld world - this one being a game for the DS. And out of all the mana games I've played, it is by far the worst, and possibly one of the worst RPG games I've played. From story to game mechanics, this is almost a complete lemon, so if you dislike negative reviews, just skip this. I'll try and summarize the paragraphs so you can get my main points without having to read my entire tirade.Complete lack of utilization for the DS hardware.The first thing I noticed about the game is the complete lack of stylus play, and the poor utilization of the dual-screen system. There's all this fantastic hardware for DS, and most of the games I've played have used it to some good effect, but CoM almost completely ignores it, opting to use one screen for maps/status when in most cases, your maps and status aren't really needed. After the opening screen, the stylus is not used at all. In fact, I have to wonder why they even put that one touch-screen in there.Complete lack of character story.Even in the last GBA handheld installment of the series, the story had depth. Your characters had a history, and a reason why they met. And the supporting characters had some really touching material. In CoM, the village priestess is kidnapped, and all the village elders and warriors get together to discuss what must be done. Your character, who seems to have no real station in the village, voulenteers him/herself to go, and everyone is just like ""bai. the potions shop is to your right on your way out of the village."" Not even a ""no, it's too dangerous!"" or ""let me teach you how to fight before you go."" And that's only the first of many such oddities. Either the localization team has completely butchered and removed whatever insightful dialog existed, or it just never did.Complete lack of storySort of ties in with my last point. At the end of each zone, you fight a boss monster, and someone comes out to tell you ""good job"" and give you the tiniest scrap of explanation and some artifact that allows you to access a new area of the game. You go back to the village, speak with the veteran, and he asks you to go scope out another crisis. Of the handful of zones I've been to, that's been the extent of it. Sidequests are available through a shop, but you never meet who you're helping, and the fun of discovering the sidequest is eliminated because they're just handed to you. So far (though I'm assuming this changes later), there are no towns to explore, and no benefits to talking to people.Weak character developmentAnd by character development, I mean level progression and the like. Most of your development happens through the aquisition of new weapons and armor, and the equipping of various gems you find. You can fuse gems together to create new gems with special powers. But that's pretty much it - no points to spend of any kind. All of your weapons and armor can be purchased from the shop, so questing for special weapons and armor is pointless. Furthermore, all wares have a level requirement, so apart from gems, there's no good way to max out a particular stat.Shallow and frustrating gameplay elementsYour 8 espers exist, but you can only take one of them into a dungeon with you, as opposed to previous games, where you do work to find the mana, and then its unique powers are available to you through the rest of the game. You cannot access the weapons, armor, or gems you pick up while you're still in the dungeon, or swap out your esper, until you've reached a save point. Each dungeon has multiple levels, and if you leave or die, you have to start the dungeon over again (or simply restart your game from your save point if you reached one while in-dungeon). The new gameplay mechanics are not always explained in the best way, such that I had to actually look up how to use and switch my espers.The only positives...There are four weapons that allow you to complete some puzzle-aspects in the dungeon, and you have the ability to dual-wield so you don't have to keep switching weapons, which is nice. The graphics are cute - the whole game definitely looks just like a mana game, and there are even a few anime-style cutscenes. Your performance in each dungeon section is scored off how many monsters you kill, how many chests you find, and how fast you do it in - and from this, you can get special rewards. There's a multiplayer option, which is new and supposed to be pretty fun.The lowdownI was surprised to find this used so quickly, considering it only came out a short while ago, but now I see why. By itself, any one of these flaws wouldn't be enough to ruin the game, but this many annoyances and shortage of RP aspects together make it an almost worthless pursuit. It's fine for a dungeon crawl, but with so little rewards, why not just replay a more compelling dungeon crawl game? I recommend D2 for solo play, and Gauntlet, Zelda Four Swords, or FF Crystal Chronicles for really fantastic multi-player dungeoncrawl. And, if you're interested in how the Mana series is done well on a handheld, pick up Sword of Mana."
1428914,B00269DXCK,Assassin's Creed 3 Prequel Part 2 (Spoilers not included),"My review will briefly discuss the plot and the gameplay, in that order.THE PLOT:The title of my review may seem strange, but it's fairly accurate (if I may say so myself).  Specific spoilers not included, AC2 lays groundwork for AC3.  Much like AC1 ended with more questions raised than answered, AC2 ends just when it feels like the story is really starting to get rolling again.  the plot for AC2 is a bit more locked-in than the plot for AC1 (which allowed nearly unlimited freedom).  It sounds like a bad thing, but really I felt like it kept the story on track and more interesting.  AC2 doesn't have the plot twist that AC1 had, but the plots straight-forward nature is more strongly suited (in my opinion) to the action game that it is.  That's about all I can say regarding the plot without giving anything specific away, but the main point is that if you're looking for closure on how AC1 ended, you'll have to wait for AC3.THE GAMEPLAY:If I had to sum up the gameplay in one sentence it would be this, ""Nothing but improvement over AC1.""  The breakdowns go something like this:Combat: One aspect of the game with the most improvement.  Simply put, there is more you can do to dispatch your opponent whether your are doing so from out in the open or in the shadow.  Some of the new stealth kill options and animations are just plain fun to watch.Assassinations: The primary assassination targets have more of a focus on the approach than AC1.  I think this works in its favor since I personally found few things more annoying in AC1 than creeping around to get in a nice stealth kill, only to get discovered at the last second and undo the last 5 minutes you spent sneaking and waiting for the perfect moment.Roaming and Running (from Guards): One improvement I noticed right away and was very thankful for was that Ezio climbs much faster than Altair.  Not drowning is also a nice touch.  Escaping from the guards seems a bit easier, which is mostly a good thing so that you don't end up wasting 5 or 10 minutes at a time trying to escape an encounter.Faux RPG Aspects: The weapon and armor system was a very nice touch that added a new depth to the game.  I would like to see them expand a bit more on this for AC3.Fast Travel: Each city has multiple stands where you can travel to any other stand already discovered.  Another improvement that makes the world feel a lot bigger since you can go anywhere, anytime (given that you've already been there at some point).CLOSING COMMENTS:Overall, AC2 is one significant improvement after another over AC1 with a storyline that quite literally picks up right where it left off.  Barring those with an absolute and unforgivable hatred for the first game, I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a well made video game.UPDATE (8-6-10):  I downloaded the extra content recently and just finished playing it through.  I must say that despite a few bugs, the content was well worth the money.  Memory Sequence 13 had some of the hardest, but most fun tasks in the game that I felt really epitomized what an assassin should be.  I strongly recommend the downloadable content for the extra storyline missions (as well as extra races, beat-ups and assassination contracts) though I will say that the templar lairs are passable."

2665883,B0000DKDUT,Worst film of 2003? I'm not surprised!,"Gigli has received a fairly poor reception. It has been described as the worst film of 2003, and an exercise in pandering to the egos of the two leads. I don't think it's that bad, but I can see why they say that.The plot is simple enough. Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a thug, working as an enforcer for a loan shark called Louis (Lenny Venito). Louis is worried about his boss (a cameo by Al Pacino), who has been arrested and charged by a federal prosecutor. Louis instructs Larry to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the prosecutor's mentally-challenged brother. But Louis doesn't trust Larry to get it right, so he sends another ""contractor"", this one a gay woman (Jennifer Lopez) who identifies herself as ""Ricki"", but admits shortly afterwards that it isn't her real name. So now we have the two of them minding Brian, and the stage is set for the (very conventional) conflict between two people working together.There are some speeches in this script that ring horribly false. The language is frequently coarse. I wonder if the script was originally written for someone like Eddie Murphy - he could have pulled off the speeches about being ""the gangster's gangster"" better than Ben Affleck, for example.Jennifer Lopez is a lot more threatening in Enough. She is just not credible as an ""enforcer"" in this film. And she wears a ridiculous amount of jewellery for a woman who is supposed to be ready to get physical. She could have been right for this part if the script let her.Ben Affleck is a lot more credible as a man lusting after a lesbian in Chasing Amy. In this film his performance is spotty, with his apparent intelligence seeming to rise and fall between scenes. I don't think it's his fault, though - I think it's more the fault of the script, and he has been mis-cast for theThis film isn't all bad, but there are some sorry bits. The whole of Christopher Walken's cameo is poor for example (he looks horribly ill), as is Missy Crider's scene (how did she find them?). And there are some (mercifully brief) gruesome moments, one involving a plastic take-away food knife, the other a fish tank. One wonders if the gruesome moments were attempts to make this a black comedy.All in all, this film feels as though the writer/director (Martin Brest) was indecisive, and unable to choose what kind of film he was making. He has written pieces of a romantic comedy, pieces of a black comedy, and pieces of a gangster comedy, but unfortunately he has assembled them all into the one film, and it just doesn't work. So, although I very much doubt that this is the worst film of 2003, I can see why it has been described that way."

Our local triple A radio station BOS' in Boston has been playing the current single,""Bottom dollar"" from NEXTERDAY.This is some crafty pop and rock with a voice that sounds likeit hasn't aged a day since the 80's. Listening to Ric sing""Silver"" you can't help but think of the late Ben Orr and allhis contributions to what made The Cars so special. Here in Boston they, like Areomsith, Bonnie Raitt and JGiles are not forgotten for they all shot out from this area.  Ben Orr's spiritsure rides through the melancholy sounds of several cuts aswell as the Cars sound in ""Come on"", ""Carousel"" and others.This is a well put together collection and is easily his bestsince his 80's work.

1619057,B003JA5KBW,not very good,"got this to taste test and it's not for me. it does bubble and fizz but the taste is chalk like, too bad because the ideacould sell if the taste wasn't so sad."
3741990,B00029KC2K,Great heat shielding!,"I installed a custom cone cold air intake.

Keeps the air cooler around the piping and can definitely feel a boost in acceleration. This keeps the heat out for sure."
1631459,B004BKHX1Y,So so so GOOD!,"I mean, this is a review for graham crackers. I'm not sure what else needs to be said besides these are REALLY good.I'm personally not a big fan of graham crackers to begin with. I grew up eating Honey Maid grahams and it got tired of them pretty quickly. These things however are just insanely delicious. It tastes like apple cinnamon which, honestly, shouldn't be hard to accomplish. The best part about them is tasting and seeing all the oats that are in these things. These grahams don't taste or look like a cheap products. They are just wholesome yummy goodness. My father also approves of these as they pass the ""dunk in milk"" test.If you need something sweet in the house I'd spring for these. Certainly healthier than the typical graham crackers!"
2156830,6301816218,Defective DVD,"Well, the movie's terrific, from what I remember of having seen it on TV, but you wouldn't be able to tell it from this DVD.  The manufacture is of such poor quality that my player kept skipping over damaged sections.  I couldn't watch five minutes of it.  I don't have this problem with other DVDs.  When I went to Amazon's website for help, all it recommended that I do about a defective product was &#34;Consult owner's manual&#34;.  Seriously???  For a DVD???  I have bought DVD's from Amazon in the past, without any trouble, but hereafter this will cause me to hesitate to buy DVDs here; if at all possible I will go to a brick-and-mortar store where I can take it back if necessary, as Amazon's motto seems to be &#34;Caveat emptor&#34;."
3499444,B00AM27WJI,For beginners,"I did break a little sweat, but I did not like this workout.  I felt like I was wasting time.  Jillian Micaels has a tendency to think she is a hard trainer but she stops and talks a lot...so that takes the burn out of her workouts.  She could cut the workout time in half or double the reps and make it lots better."
1440722,B002I0H09Y,cod is completely worthless,"i was looking foward to this game for a while (i hate cod, im a battlefield fan. but i fiugred since its a shooter and its a vita title, it would be worth it)and when it came out it was horrendous. I think anybody that has good or atleast mediocre reviews are in total denial or are just totally into anything they come out with for the vita console. its sad the potential the vita has but the complete cr@p of games that are coming out. this games campaign and multiplayer are the worst part of the game, honestly if it wasnt for the hostiles mode i would have really lost it.the campaign- has no real point, no real story, and for some reason it seems like a 12 year old wrote the dialogue. the say the f word every chance they get (i do to and im not one of those people that get offended by bad language in games, i encourage it..to an extent..), its like effin this and effin that and roger effin this....its pathetic...their is no actual story contribution when it comes to black ops 2 or one, i understand they wanted to make short missions like unit 13 (and failed), but there really is no point to the campaign.the multiplayer- the main reason people love this franchise....its worthless...i spawn either with enemy targets in my sights or i spawn in enemy sights...and thats if you can get a match to load. i have high speed internet so its not that, my vita works just fine...but i hardly ever get into a server to the point when i try again and i get in im actually shocked...this problem was also so for resistance burning skies...nihilistic....same worthless people that brought you this worthless game...(keep in mind worthless comes a lot in this review cus of amazons censorship...i have other choice words in mind) its not like the mechanics in the game are the worse, its just the small levels, lack of being able to get into servers, and the graphics arent the best. things lag sometimes i end up shooting at a person in my team because the green name tag thats suppose to be up doesnt show up till a couple seconds after i confused him for an enemy. same has been done to me.i dont play this game at all for the multiplayer or the worthless campaign.hostiles-ahhh...finaly...something positive to say..this mode is similar to that of modern warfare 3s version of zombies where you get attacked by waves of hostile soldiers instead of zombies. this is actually fun, because its just shooting people, so i can complain about lack of concept, story, and i dont have to be online so i dont have to deal with the lags this game deals with online. it gets pretty challenging and its just the thing to do while at lunch or any situation where waiting is involved (lunch break, dmv, dentist, bathroom visits lol). but yeah this game is worthless, they should have just had this mode as a dlc....im not sure how games work, so this may not make total sense if you do know how...but i feel instead of wasting space with the campaign, they shouldve just made a totally bad a$$ multiplayer. with the hostiles cus thats fun too.do i recommend...no....maybe if you buy used cheap...but dont give your hopes up"
3756949,B003UT3S6Q,Not quite the full effect as advertised...,"With that said, it makes the stuff you buy in the auto parts store look like water.Some people have complained about the smell, I really don't find it that offensive, maybe it's because I was working outside on a cool windy day.Sprays on well, with good coverage, and my guess is that each bottle will be good for about 3 wheel cleanings on my 18""s. The subsequent cleanings should be easier though now that the wheels have been sealed.My one gripe is that it still does need scrubbing for complete cleansing. You will not get perfectly clean wheels unless you remove them from the car (OK maybe if you have tiny brakes). Most calipers have a relatively tight tolerance to the wheels, which prevents you from scrubbing the area immediately adjacent to the calipers. Removing the wheels from the car is the ideal method for a baseline cleaning."
1153160,B00DJFIMW6,Hilarious,This is a fun additive game. The sound effects are hilarious. This is a fast game and you have to be alert. It changes quickly and before you know it you 'll let the poor minion crash right on your screen. Children and adults will be entertained for hours. It is not difficult at all to follow through.  My family and I love the Despicable Me movies so this game is an extension of the minioncraziness from the movie.
1388224,B000P46NMK,Tedious,"Very disappointing. It's the same tedium time and again. The basic game play is boring enough, but it never gets any more interesting and as the game progresses, it simply throws in more beggars and guards who annoyingly trip up the tedious tasks so you end up repeating the same boring sequences again and again.On the plus side, it's one of the most visually appealing games I've seen."
577819,B004RJYNXK,Doesn't save the score,It doesn't save the campaign score. Have to constantly restart the game. Very very very annoying. Nexus s cm 7
2587782,B000066HAS,"Wow, this is so good!","Sean Penn was fantastic.  Michelle Pfeiffer was just as Oscar worthy.  Dakota Fanning is so mature for her age and could probably act circles around most adults.  Richard Schiff was a great jerk of a lawyer, he has such a stern demeanor and visage.  Laura Dern, making a sort of come back to the silver screen, was subtle yet as important as Sam.  The story is easily conceivable, but the vigor and care with which the players deliver this story's touching story and inspiring words and outcome make it so enjoyable and so darn good.  It's a great movie, and if you don't cry when Laura Dern gives Lucy (In The Sky With Diamonds) back, you're not human.  It's like not crying at Fried Green Tomatoes or Steel Magnolias, you just have to cry.  The soundtrack is great, Eddie Vedder is a perfect match for &quot;You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.&quot;  Amiee Mann and that other gentleman, I feel bad forgetting his name, are so melodic on &quot;Two Of Us.&quot;  All around, cinema, script, performances, score and soundtrack, this movie has it all: commercial appeal and critical success, even if I'm the only one that thinks so.  It's great!"
1460214,B003O6CBIG,Worst CoD,"The multiplayer maps are awful. When the maps are bad, the game is bad. The &#34;destruction&#34; is really stupid too."
1295718,B0002F58TG,Very nice for the money,"I didn't know what to expect given the price, but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money. I am impressed by the quality of materials, components, and construction. For example, the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed; they work smoothly, and firmly hold the strings in tune. The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box; the action didn't seem inordinately high, but I couldn't resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so, and now the guitar plays even better. I might tinker some more at some point, probably when it comes time to replace the strings, but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full-bodied dreadnought, which is rich and resonant and very impressive. I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price, but the proof is indisputably before me."
1296941,B0002KZIVY,The Slide of Fender continues,"Unless you guys are receiving something I am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. My backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my Fender stratocaster. This is inexcusable. All the other Fender backplates I have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. I simply cannot understand what Fender is thinking.  I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost."
3672534,B0027IVL6K,Oh yeah!  Instant feline favorite at unbeatable price!,"I sprinkled a little catnip on the base and also on the corner of the hammock to get them interested--within a day, both my kitties were big fans of this knee-high cat tree.The hammock and the base have a cream-colored furry material which is soft and snuggly.  My 11-lb. cat fits in the bed comfortably with a little room to spare.  Because the hammock  streches a bit when they're in it, they can rest their chin on the edge the way cats like to do.I'm very happy with this purchase! It's soft, cozy, attractive, doesn't take up lots of space, and hey, the cats are digging it.  And it cost 1/2 as much as a similar item I saw at the pet store (which didn't even have the awesome hammock!); plus I got free delivery from Amazon.  And it assembled very easily too.  I wouldn't recommend it for a cat over 15 lbs though."

1320590,B00005A53C,Great Game for the PSP,"I am not a gamer but a casual user of the PSP.  I really enjoyed this game, the story, the gameplay and most importantly the action.  I do not play games all day or stuck on all the details, but this game delivers at least a hour of action and remarkable gameplay.  I highly recommend."
1301945,B003VWJ2K8,Snark SN-1 Tuner is $$ well spent,Excellent little device for the money.  Easy to use.  I have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well.  This will get you in tune for $11 or less - can't beat it.
164179,B00CXAC1ZW,Google (ASUS) Nexus 7 owners beware,"Works fine for Samsung Galaxy S3 cellphone, but requires extra software be purchased from Google Play Store to work properly on the Google (ASUS) Nexus 7 tablet. That makes the listing on Amazon very misleading."
1482489,B004WL4LWQ,Dissapointng,"New Physics Engine:You can really tell the difference in the new physics engine, it is harder to hit and when it does happen, it is pretty realistic, even if it is a bit anti-climatic. The speed of the game seems to be slower now and is a little more clunky which makes the new engine a step backward in my book.Passing:Passing still sucks like in NHL 11. The manual passing makes it difficult to do tap tap passing. You find yourself spending half the game focusing on simply passing properly. Quick / long passes require you to hold the trigger longer which just allows the defense to patch the holes. Do what I do and just turn off manual passing and increase the pass speed, this makes the game a little more realistic and fun to play.Player RatingsOnce again, the ratings are WAY off.  Zetterberg is a 91 and has failed to score more then 24 goals two straight years and if his playmaking skill is the reason, than why is Claude Girouix an 87 when he nearly had the same points, goals and assists? Parise is a 91 and played less than 15 games last season. I understand that talent is what makes the rankings, but come on. Stamkos is a 91 as well... So EA, you are telling me that Stamkos is no better than Parise and Zetterberg... LOL, that is all I have to say about that... ""L-O-L."" The ratings need to be more consistent among like players and should be based off the previous season, NOT 2- 3 seasons ago. The only star player who seems to have been updated is Martin Brodeur who is at 85 this season. Backstrom is an 89 and he only 65 points last season and was AWFUL in the playoffs, I guess EA is assuming he will have a bounceback year?Anticipaton AI:Have not noticed anthing really new with the AI. The computer does seem to play stronger defense and it is now more difficult to set up in the offensive zone which really adds to this game. AI was never a problem, it is good as ever for the computer and is still terrible on the player's team. The AI players on your own team are still AWFUL. I can't tell you how many times I held up the opposing center on a faceoff just to watch my wingers do, well, nothing, they just stand there. I can't count the number of times where I am pinned against the board behind the opposing goal and my wingers simply stand in front of the net instead of going along the boards to cycle the puck.Goalie Fighting:Meaningless other than just for laughs. It is more annoying (especially online) that the goalies can fight now. You have to be the goalie and skate toward center ice holdng A and tapping Y to fight which is a bit annoyng, but come on, it is still pretty fun to fight with the goalies.Graphics:The same. The texture of the ice looks slightly different, but pretty much everything else is the same.More Dynamic Goalies:The goalies are better, they are not as easy to deke out now and you can now actually interact with them (run into them, knock their masks off, etc.). This is one of the largest improvements in this game because it was WAY too easy to score in NHL 11.Legends:Cool addition, but it really bothers me that they left out obvious legends in Orr and Hull, then added players who were good, but were NO WHERE CLOSE to legend status such as Roenick and Salming. The roster is also incomplete when you play the legends team, so NHL stars were added to make up the team. The rest of the roster also leaves out current players who are clear legendary players such as Brodeur and Lidstrom and possibly Crosby. They simply added the highest rated players in the game and called it a day.Overall, I am a little dissapointed with this game. EA added a few gimmicks, such as goalie fights,gamecenter and legends and failed to improve flaws from the previous game such as as a poor passing engine and player team ai. They did not improve the graphics either and most cut videos and commentary are the same from NHL 11. EA Sports attention to detail is also dissapointing, for example, Ilya Bryzgalov's leg pads are still in Phoenix Coyotes red (perhaps a hint of how this is simply a slightly altered NHL 11.). The Winnipeg Jets jersey is also missing from the game, but it was unveiled recently so maybe it wasn't possible."

3618852,B0009YJ4CW,not a good idea and not everlasting,This bal container is good for putting other treats inside it but the ball refills are expensive and they make my dog sick.  They also do not last for very long.  Putting the treat inside it is REALLY DIFFICULT...VERY HARD...TAKES A LONG TIME WITH LOTS OF STREENGTH...and then once the dog has chewed enough to get it out she can eat the whole thing right away and then the next day has diarrhea all day.
1336576,B00006IKBL,Fun... when it ran,"The premise of the game sounded great- a GBA version of LOTR. Just what I needed to relive the fun of the movie. Sure, there were a few glitches here & there, but initially I had a fun playing it. Plus it came with little cards of the characters, which was neat.Then came the big glitch. The glitch that made it impossible for me to continue playing. The glitch that froze up my game. At one point during the game, about 2/3 of the way through, I tried entering a new area. Evidently the game decided that I should've finished something else first, so it completely froze up- making further gameplay impossible. Since some parts of the game were incredibly frustrating due to glitches that made it very hard to complete, I just lost interest in trying to re-play to get to that spot in the game. I traded it in, only to discover that I wasn't the only one who was having this trouble.This could've been far better done. This was just a shoddily made game that was thrown together at the last minute. Save your money & don't even get this."
1829792,B0000025NU,Billy Joel the way he was meant to sound,"The liner notes say it, everyone repeats it, and it's true:  This is a CD to be played LOUDLY.  The difference between these live recordings of Joel's early work and the studio recordings of those pieces is amazing.  As soon as the band smashes its way in on &quot;Miami 2017,&quot; you're on a roller-coaster ride that just doesn't stop.  Initially, I was a little skeptical about the idea of choosing audience sizes to match the songs, but it works perfectly here, proving that Joel knew exactly what effect he was trying to create with each of these pieces.  This album's brilliance lies in the way it redefines songs I passed right over before.  &quot;Los Angelenos,&quot; for example, is fairly mellow on &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot;; here it's a funky, energetic rocker.  Similarly, I never cared much for &quot;Captain Jack,&quot; but this live performance transforms it into a 7-minute epic of guitars and drums and Billy Joel playing the piano so hard he (allegedly) breaks strings.  In addition, we get such fare as &quot;You're My Home&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves You Now,&quot; both of which are gems that could easily have gone unnoticed otherwise.  The adrenaline running through the crowds on each of these performances gives these songs the hard-rocking quality Billy Joel always wanted them to have, as opposed to the somewhat oversentimentalized feel some of them had on his other albums.  This is a CD you'll listen to again and again, and it'll pump you up every time.  For all those people who thought Billy Joel was only about soft-rock ballads:  think again."

1781580,B003K3HM6O,Update to: Good Price and It Works,"Update:  The issue with the pull cord to turn the light on and off (see original review) makes this fixture less and less adequate as time goes on.  The switch itself, and the angle of placement of the switch make it impossible to use.  So now if I want the light off, I have to turn the fan off too.  Not what I wanted, but as the saying goes: ""You get what you pay for.""Very easy to install and comes with two options that should make it work on virtually any ceiling fan.  I read a review saying it was small - hmmm, must be that this person had a very large fan, or just wanted a bigger light.  For me, it's just the right size.  There are a couple of things that did bug me - the poll chain is actually a piece of string, and the switch is really, really a cheap switch that is difficult to use.  Come on guys/gals, you could have made this a perfect product and an even better value by adding a real chain and a switch with a flared, smooth chain-guide throat that would make the whole pulling the chain to turn it on possible.  It's too bad, but like virtually everything I've bought that was ""Made in China"" seems to miss out on these refinements."

1753478,B0017NS8H6,Perhaps with instructions one could get this put together. Doubtful instructions are coming soon according to customer support.,"Of all the bad user manual's I've seen, this is the worst in a long time. In addition, a screw (not said to need to be removed by instructions - yet needing to be removed per customer service) was so tight I needed to use my vice grip and a driver to remove it. In an effort to see if the screw needed to be removed (or not), I contacted customer service and got an unhelpful, defensive guy (names not mentioned) that said &#34;corporate&#34; was responsible for the really bad instructions in addition to a problem with translation from German to English. He suggested I mail the item to them to remove the screw at my expense. There are two items marked with the number &#34;1,&#34; two items in the manual marked with the number &#34;2), two items in the manual marked number &#34;3.&#34; Imagery to help with assembly is not helpful. Having the screw already attached was not helpful since I was not clued in to remove it. The final straw was the wire spool which immediately splayed out wire all over everything and could not be rewound. This is not a very helpful design feature and I know from experience the design itself is the flaw. Even a heads up with instructions would have been helpful, but I doubt it. Customer service blamed everything on somebody else, took no responsibility and gave me the impression my future with this machine would not be good even if I could get it assembled. So I am returning it. Thank you so much, Amazon.com. I use Amazon.com so bad-judgment (I didn't know any better then; now I do) purchases such as this do not sting so much."

I liked much of Snoop's earlier work, but after he came out with this album and &quot;Topp Dog,&quot; his second No Limit album, it ruined his career.  It left me  with only one belief: Snoop Dogg is falling off.  He's lost his 'bounce to  the ounce' and funky rhythm that he once had.  I'm sorry, as much as it  pains me to hate on Snoop Dogg, I have no choice...he didn't show me  nothing on this album besides the fact that he's losing his edge in the  world of hip-hop music."

So if you have the money and want to try these technology advanced strings i dont think you will be disappointed. Some people say they are too slick.. and i can see that when you put new strings on you expect them to feel a certain way..  But you will get over that once you see how long they last.
3223626,B003DLTBXU,FANTASTIC,"I just saw this film on Netflix and I just loved it! So much so that I'm now buying it! I mean seriously, I just finished watching it like 30 seconds ago and I had to see if it was for sale here on amazon! Romantic comedy's follow a certain formula but this one does not, it creates it's own and it goes down paths, some you guess but most you don't. The acting was brilliant, the writing was brilliant and Emma Caufield is utterly fantastic! I love when I find films like this that I fall in love with!"

334119,B001GZB5W0,Terrible product. Worse packaging!,"I bought this locally. Wish I had read these reviews first! As most everyone else has mentioned - the case would not feed the tape after the first cut. I did manage, after a long time and lots of turning the little ""feeder"" wheel, to get the tape end to poke out enough to grab with tweezers so I did not have to smash the case. But, am I supposed to carry the dispenser, tweezers and scissors everywhere? Really? On top of that, the tape does not stick all that well. Although I pressed it in as firmly as I could, it bunched up and rolled right off inside my shoes within about 30 minutes - creating a nasty blister of its own in the process. Dr Scholl's offers a money back guarantee - and I plan to take them up on that."

2146134,6301649737,The Original Profiler: Petersen before C.S.I.,"MANHUNTER was the first movie to feature the now ubiquitous ""profiler,""an agent who uses psychology and empathy with his target to pursue him.This film, based on the equally original novel RED DRAGON by ThomasHarris, is stylish and effective.  Its luster may have been diminishedby the many subsequent efforts in the same area (I won't say imitators),but it is still worthwhile for its ""Miami Vice"" style direction andmusic(Michael Mann directs), its taut police procedural scenes, a chilling""key revelation"" scene, and star-making performances by Tom Noonan, JoanAllen, William Petersen, and especially Brian Cox as the originalHannibal Lector.Note: There are two earlier widescreen DVD releases of this film, eachwith extra features.  One is a ""director's cut"" special edition, whichhas received mixed reviews.  I didn't think it was an improvement overthe original.  Both editions appear to be out of print, but there aremany ""New & Used"" sellers on Amazon.  I would recommend the ""flashlightcover"" version over this one, which appears to have no extra featuresat all."
3636179,B000MKHQG4,Caveat Emptor,"This product is superbly engineered, but the implementation sabotages the entire experience.  I've had a CatGenie 60 for about three years, and upgraded to a CatGenie 120 about 5 months ago.  When it works, it works well.  When something just a little out of the engineer's expectations occur, it can make your life a living hell.It tells when a cat goes in, waits ten minutes, then completely cleans up after the cat.  What could possibly be wrong with that?  For one, it doesn't do that by default, and why in the world would you not want that done by default?  The only time you might NOT want that is if it was in your bathroom and you were about to take a shower, but you'd be able to know it was coming and hit the pause button.And get this: the auto cleanup only works 14 out of 24 hours of the day.  If the cat has a somewhat irregular schedule, or you have two cats, chances are you will have smelly cat poo in the cat box for up to *10* *HOURS*!  Tell me why in the world would any system be designed like that!  It's not negotiable, it's not changeable.  10 hours of the day, the litter box simply WILL NOT OPERATE... on purpose!Heaven help you if you have a power failure.  The system will come back online with the default settings (and remember what is NOT default?) which means if it happens while you are out and about, you may find your cat mysteriously decorating your house because the litter box stopped cleaning up after itself... which is the whole purpose of spending hundreds of dollars on this thing in the first place.  If you're prone to having power failures in your area, you'd better not rely on this system for a long weekend away from home.  I speak from personal experience, and it is DISGUSTING.Next let's talk about the low solution notification.  I keep my CatGenie in the basement, because, let's face it, it smells a LOT worse than a well-maintained clay litter box... especially in that 10-hour hiatus it takes every day.  I don't often go down into the basement except to change ""sani"" solution cartridges and to do laundry.  The old CatGenie 60 had an insistent low-solution beep that you had to acknowledge for it to shut up, and then it would  get annoying again when it was empty.  You typically had enough reaction time to order new cartridges before you were in trouble.The CatGenie 120 beeps much more softly, and only beeps for 30 seconds *EVERY* *HOUR*.  If you do not spend enough time in the area where it's beeping, you'll miss it... and again, the way you'll know something is wrong is when your cat starts decorating other parts of your house; and if you were on your last cartridge, you've got at least two days that you have to switch to clay litter because the CatGenie blindsided you and you're waiting for new cartridges in the mail.  Once again, I speak from personal experience, and once again, it is DISGUSTING.The actual mechanics of the CatGenie are fantastic.  It works, and works well.  It's about as close as we've come to zero-maintenance sanitation for our furry friends.  It boggles my mind that the creators of this device would implement its functionality with a completely mindless set of assumptions that, simply said, make the device a LOT more maintenance than it needs to be.On to other annoyances:  The granules track EVERYWHERE.  Did I mention the unit is in the basement?  I'm vacuuming these jokers out of the rug on the SECOND FLOOR.  PetNovations mentions that you need to add granules about once every six months; I have determined that is a bald-faced lie.  2 - 2.5 months requires almost a complete refill.  It seems like a LITTLE effort could be put into containing the granules, as they are NOT cheap... but that is probably exactly why no effort is put into such a venture.The smell.  Good Lord, the smell!  Granted, you could expect that liquefied cat poo will never be particularly aromatic, but with the hood on it should not chase you out of the room.  (I might have forgotten to mention that I have a hood for the thing)  I think a lot of the odor could be contained by a simple flap on the hood opening, but of course nobody ever thought of that, and designing my own would not be pretty.Maintenance and cleaning.  When it works, it works well.  When it needs cleaning, or you need to remove a clog (and it WILL happen) it is just downright NASTY.  Just cleaning the water level sensor is a chore, and that has to be done fairly regularly, at least for me.  I think some effort should have been put into engineering a line flushing capability within the unit, but that may just be because I'm an engineer too and it cheeses me off that I've had to break down this device when it's all nastified so many times.  It is NOT an enjoyable experience.The new 120 came with a ""cleaning kit"" of sorts that you're supposed to use every 2 months.  I got 2 of them.  It's been 5 months.  Guess what is not available from their online store?  If you said ""the cleaning kits?"" you'd have been right on the money.  Why tell you to use it every two months and not give you a way to get more?Well, after all I've said, I'm still using my CatGenie, because it does save a lot of time and energy for me on a day-to-day basis, and my cats seem to appreciate the clean litter.  But come on... some of this stuff is a no-brainer.  It's a frustrating experience.UPDATE:  I have now completely stopped using the CatGenie.  One of my cats abruptly decided he'd had enough with it and began a ""smelly earth"" campaign to induce change.  I bought a Litter Robot, and while I don't like having to empty it out every few days, it is SO much better than the CatGenie, with a lot less to go wrong."

The game improves on every level over Fusion such as the graphics, sound, and game play (you can play as Zero Suit Samus!) The story isn't as good either, in fact it's hardly there at all. All I knew is that Samus was sent to Zebes to destroy Mother Brain and that's it...yeah some story.All the same weapons and power ups are here that were in Fusion and ZM features a whole new set of bosses and enemies.

1295585,B0002E3DLM,Locking Legs Into Place Caused Their Finish To Become Scuffed Up,"I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all."
249004,B000GG0GF2,Bridget's Review,"Do you constantly hear a ringing in your ears? If so, you probably suffer from tinnitus. This condition can be a mild irritant but for some, it affects their daily lives. Lipo-Flavonoid is a dietary supplement that can be used for adults and children who are 12 years of age or older. Take one caplet with a meal up to three times a day. You can take up to two caplets three times a day with a meal as well. It can take up to six months to take effect.I was taken to an ENT when I was younger because of constant sinus infections and ringing in my ears. I have suffered with this condition for so long that I forgot what it felt like to hear clearly. When I received these pills in the mail, I was skeptical. It seems like every time I take a drug that works for other people (like Midol, Excedrin, etc.) I end up disappointed. I noticed a significant difference after about a week of taking this supplement. I also only took it once a day for three days with meal to make sure that I wouldn't have some adverse reaction. After the first three days, I took one pill twice a day with food and I'm now up to one pill three times a day. Tinnitus runs in my family and when a bunch of us women get together, we're always mentioning ""the sirens in our ears"". Luckily, I found something that will help keep me out of that conversation from now on."

It's still not bad, but it's not that much better than those at Walgreen's so it doesn't make sense to pay extra for these pads. I still prefer ""Iris Neat 'n Dry Floor Protection and Training Pads for Puppies and Dogs"" though. The quality is slightly better and it's the least expensive of the three. I would probably give that brand 3 stars. All three brands are quilted. They're all thin so my dog still leaves paw tracks. I'm still searching for thick puppy pads that won't break the bank."
2321116,6304758030,South of the Border Fun,"This fun and funny crime caper has a great cast and lots of south-of-the-border flavor that makes it an entertaining 88 minutes at the movies. William A. Seiter's Borderline is a nifty little film that has more in common with The Big Steal than the noir film it is often advertised as. It is a blend of humor, crime and fun that grows on you more and more until its snappy ending.It seems both the L.A.P.D. and United States Treasury Customs wants to stop a dope smuggling ring bringing narcotics across the border from Mexico. Claire Trevor is the enthusiastic if green L.A. cop Madeline Haley, a former O.S.S. agent who talks her way into the assignment of going down south in an attempt to get information on the nasty middleman Pete Ritche, hoping it will lead them to Mr. Big. TV's Perry Mason, Raymond Burr, is the heavy in the white suit, Ritche, and plays the role with menace.Madeline sort of stumbles into Ritchie but before she can find anything out, Johnny Mackland, an unknown player working for the L.A. end of the connection, hijacks Ritchie's gold so he can make a deal for the next shipment. He ends up taking Madeline with him after the guns are drawn and the chase is on.The chase across Mexico, as they try to avoid Ritchie and elude the cops is a lot of fun. Madeline and Johnny start telling each other tall tales and warming up to each other along the way. When Johnny's pal Miguel gets shot they have a body on their hands to deal with, complicating the chase even more. Fred MacMurray is good as Johnny, the cop who doesn't know Madeline is a cop, who doesn't know he's a cop!Sort of a fun pulp film with more flavor than a habanero pepper, Trevor gives a cute performance as she begins to like Johnny, even getting a bit jealous of the oh so friendly young and pretty daughter of a not too smart Mexican cop. He unknowingly helps them garner a plane to Encinada for the big deal. As the two near the border, each regrets having to turn the other one in because they've fallen for each other.Once they get straightened out on just who works for who, a rousing shoot-out with Ritchie and his gang climaxes a great ending to this very fun to watch film. A film that's meant as entertainment, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Fans of genre films like this will enjoy going south of the border with this one."
1809682,B008V4NFC2,Serious Design Defect,"The shaft is 1 1/2 inches or so behind the front of the tool.  Therefore, if the blade is at a right angle to the saw body it is impossible to get up to a wall at right angles to your cut.  This is because the ""tool less"" hinge is in the way.  The depth gauge is good for cuts with the blade sticking out the front, but useless otherwise.  Also, the tool less system requires large hands with great strength. I'll take a hex wrench any day.I gave this tool one star.  But, if you always use the tool with the blade sticking out the front and can use the depth gauge, this tool is probably 5 star.  Many times, however, there is not enough clearance to use the saw this way.  Also, I find that I get better control with the blade out the side."

So I used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes, mostly carrying it on my shoulders, sometimes by one of the two handles.Then the side handle started coming apart: the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used. It will be OK for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking (which I kind of expect at this point!). Meanwhile I'm going to buy another (sturdier) gig bag.Save your money and get something better than this."

3590920,B000260FX4,Rena XP series are excellent filters,"The Rena XP series filters are the best bargain in the canister filter market. Eheims may have more bells and whistles and Magnums may be more well known, but Rena XP's occupy the best bang for your buck slot.I've used my XP2 now for a year and a half on a moderately stocked 65 gallon with excellent success. I don't clean the filter as often as I should and I don't do water changes every week like some say is essential. Still, the XP2 keeps the water clean enough to raise and house 5 large discus, 4 large clown loaches and assorted other cleanup crew. While this product page is for the XP3 and I've commented on the XP2, I have also used the XP3. In fact, it's replacing my XP2 on the 65gallon and the XP2 is moving to my 29gallon. The 29 currently is serviced by a Magnum HOT with biowheel (which in turn is moving to the 20gallon).Servicing the filters couldn't be easier - lift the center handle and away you go. Like I said, I don't service it monthly, but when I do, it's simple and straight-forward. The baskets are generous in size and hold a lot of filter medium. I was fortunate and got a large service ""kit"" on sale one day. It had 10 or so filter pads, plus bags of charcoal and other media. That has sufficed for the past 18 months.If you know about discus, you know how finicky they are about water quality. The fact that the XP2 services them for a couple of months at a time between cleanings says a lot about the filter.Just get one! At the price, you can't beat it."

2667740,B0000E6FON,This Lady Snowblood Doesn't Fly,"The Princess Blade is a homage to an infinitely better movie, 1973's Lady Snowblood. It's not like they try to hide that fact - it's a homage, not a rip-off. The Japanese name of both films, Shurayuki-hime, is identical, and the two main characters even have the same name, Yuki. In Japanese, ""Shura"" is a Buddhist term very like ""Hell"" or ""netherworld,"" a place of violence and carnage. ""Yuki"" mean ""snow"" and is a common girl's name. ""Hime"" means ""princess"" or ""lady."" ""Shurayuki-hime"" is also a play on ""Shirayuki-hime,"" the Japanese name for Snow White. All this according to the movie notes on the Lady Snowblood DVD.In Lady Snowblood, in Meiji Japan the titular character is the child of a woman whose husband and son are murdered by a band of thugs. After the murders, the wife is raped and tortured by the killers for three days. Surviving that ordeal, she dedicates herself to tracking and killing the people responsible. She offs the first one but is then captured and jailed. Dying in prison in childbirth, she charges - some would say curses - her infant daughter to finish the job when she's old enough. For what it is, this is an extraordinarily well done film. Even with all the extreme violence and second-rate actors overdoing their death throes as they spurt buckets of fake blood we'd expect from a Seventies Japanese samurai flick, there are also moments in Lady Snowblood that are eerily beautiful.In The Princess Blade, in that unspecified near-future time so beloved of low-budget sci-fi, Yuki's mother is the leader of a gang of assassins. Betrayed by one of her own, she's also tortured for three days, but in this case doesn't survive the experience. The daughter, unaware how her mother died - she's only two years old at the time - becomes a member of the gang herself. Not until she's almost 20 does she discover the gang leader is also her mother's murderer. After trying and failing to kill him, she runs for her life and the movie proceeds from there.If I may be allowed to seemingly digress for a moment: I believe that most people - unless they absolutely hate a particular type of movie - will enjoy any film, of any genre, as long as it's well done. Look at all the people not previously fans of anime who loved Ghost In the Shell. The Princess Blade is low-budget, hyper-violent, Japanese chop-socky. It's well enough done that if you're already a fan of such movies, you'll probably enjoy it. However, unlike Lady Snowblood, The Princess Blade is not well enough done to have crossover appeal, i.e. it just won't do it for people not already predisposed to like this sort of film.If you're a genre fan, I'd say of The Princess Blade, go for it. If not, and you just have an idle interest in watching a good low-budget Japanese flick with a sword-wielding female assassin as the main character, I suggest passing on The Princess Blade and watching Lady Snowblood instead (now available in an absolutely superb DVD transfer, by the way). You'll enjoy the experience immensely more."

392044,B003CFB2A2,"So far, soo good","I have taken a lot of Nitric Oxide in my day, stacked this with other things and tried many a different brand. This by far has given the most consistent results and effects from what I have taken in the past. It takes a bit to kick in, but you definitely feel it. The pumps are not overbearing but definitely there. And you are left feeling pretty pumped and looking vascular throughout the entire day. For those of you that complained about headaches, unfortunately that's a side effect from Nitric Oxide in a lot of people. As far as a RAISE in blood pressure? I have to call BS on that. Nitric Oxide does pretty much the complete opposite. It's a vasodilator. Meaning it opens up your main arteries to provide more wiggle room for blood and oxygen to flow through. So if anything, you'll see a significant DROP in blood pressure.The only downfall, and a reason why i knocked it down to 4 stars, is because the pills themselves. They are huge, and require a lot. I understand that probably keeps the cost down. But if your under 200lb, expect to take 8 a day. Not all at once thank god, but more than enough.

However, the main reason people didn't enjoy this as much as the others was because of the young, blonde-haired, kid, Raiden.Actually, I find that once you get used to change, it really doesn't matter that much, in order to introduce Raiden, a brand new character, you wouldn't have the slightest clue about his past existance and Raiden's style of motion and techniques resemble almost identical to Snake's, other than the awkward cartwheel that Raiden does. But then again, it's just my own opinion.The storyline is without a doubt some of the best I've ever seen. Not only does it provide a strong emotional dialogue, but it has an odd and unique twist of an ending, especially if you wait after the credits.One of the main aspects that can't be arguemental, is that the graphics are richly stunning, filled with great architecture, colors, and facial expressions. Graphics like that can still compare closely to Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater.The sound is not any different, having voice overs that sound greatly accurate to their roles and music that either raises action or a calm and gentle tune.Gameplay factors are still very good, exactley the same as any other Metal Gear game in the franchise, but still very well-done.The only thing I believe that will never change is the long cinematics. So much of the time it'll be just like watching a movie, with not a lot of game time. You may have played the 1st or 3rd games, but this has the cinematics with the most length.Once you realize that after playing for a bit, you'll know this isn't a game to play with 5 of your friends, and since it gives off a serious mood to it, overall, the fun factor won't be at it's highest. The gameplay itself gets repetitive very quick even though you get a sword, there are some funny things you can do,(such as: get a guard to pee on Raiden's head over the building, kiss a poster, toss a magazine on the floor so the guard will stare at it) it gets old and playing it again really isn't worth the replay value.Overall, it deserves a well earned, 5 out of 5 stars."

I am black and have tattoos and this product is not made to be used on any one with ""dark"" skin, fair hair, gray hair, or even tattoos. I am surprised they actually put this on the market. How could you not think people with dark skin, fair hair, red hair or tattoos would be interested and want to try this. So i have it and can't get rid of it so i plan on trying it out anyways just to see. I am black, however im not dark dark. It may or may not work. I give it two stars for the fact that as someone stated the technology that we have today allows for dark skinned people, people with fair hair, and etc. to use light based hair removal.

1303776,B00BG6ZM0K,A mixed bag,"I love Tascam gear, and have used it for nearly 30 years. I was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.While the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. Also, the complete lack of a manual with the one I got made it very difficult understand the functions. (Sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 CDs of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install CD?)There was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen. I was forced into trial and error to see if I could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode. I could not. I could record and layer multiple tracks (I was using Audacity, didn't want to install Cubase), but I could not get playback from the previous tracks while I also had live input. Now this could have been my computer or Audacity, as it is an older Win XP machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem.There was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to Tascam's web site. I'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive. There should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product. If I am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from ""user community"" threads in some blog.Which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included. I use mostly Linux, with only one Windows machine for software which I can't get on Linux. I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but was under time constraints.Then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. With a hardware mixer, I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. Computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. The controls on  this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react. I found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process. With a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (Yeah, I know, touch screens are COOL.)Also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and OS, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.I am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful. I know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc., etc. I value function over fashion, however, and that is what I have always liked about Tascam gear: it was supremely functional. This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.Good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. The layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with. Old Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists. Not so here.I had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2.5 if I could) for me. Come on, Tascam, you can do better than this."
2507508,B00005JMQW,Guy named Otto Octavius winds up with eight limbs. Four mechanical arms welded right onto his body. What are the odds?,"In 2002, Sam Raimi made a Saturday morning cartoon.In 2007, Sam Raimi made an unabashed piece of s***.In 2004, Sam Raimi made an actual film with a story.I could really relate to Peter Parker's plight when I saw Spider-Man 2 theatrically. During that time, I was lazy and always late; disappointing my professors and yes, even employers. I was brilliant but couldn't quite pull it together. It's nice to be reminded of an actual personal connection I had to a superhero character.I'm tempted to make an erectile dysfunction joke about Toby Maguire losing his powers but that isn't the right metaphor so I won't.Spider-Man 2 has uncommonly witty, intentionally funny dialogue for the comic book movie genre. Here are some of my favorite exchanges:Peter: ""I've been reading poetry lately.""Mary Jane: ""Whatever that means.""Miss Brant: ""Sir, your wife's on the line, she said she lost her checkbook.""J. Jonah Jameson: ""Thanks for the good news!""And of course, anything from Mr. Ditkovich, the humorous, debt-obsessed Russian landlord for Peter's apartment building:Ditkovich: ""Rent!""Peter: ""Hi.""Ditkovich: ""Hi? What's hi? Can I spend it?""Ditkovich: ""If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat.""A happy, glasses-wearing, 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' montage is infinitely better than Spider-Man 3's jackass, emo-hair Saturday Night Fever montage.High points: Alex Ross' spectacular opening title design, Ditkovich and his family (including a cameo by Louis Lombardi aka Edgar Stiles from 24), an Evil Dead-style hospital massacre, Alfred Molina, J.K. Simmons, Doc Ock lighting a cigar with one of his tentacles, the lakeside climax and ""Go get 'em, tiger"".Low points: James Franco's acting, Aunt May's 30-minute monologue, little ""Henry"" the plot device, a mask-less Spider-Man saving dozens of saintly train passengers (in a Crucifix pose) who promise to keep his secret safe.This superior sequel ends on a curiously dark, almost chilling music cue and a worried look on Kirsten Dunst's face that left me feeling a bit uneasy."

1632620,B004DP0DGO,"Good texture, good taste","Granolas, in general, can vary greatly in texture and density.

To each their own, perhaps.For me, though, this Back to Nature granola has exactly the texture and density that I'm after...somewhere in the middle of the granola-density-spectrum, if there is such a thing: Nice medium density, with a great crunchy feel.Regarding taste, I confess that I wouldn't know specifically what Agave tastes like.  I will say, though, that the Vanilla Agave combination works well.

1692892,B00002ND64,"Basic, critical protection.","This is a very basic, inexpensive, and readily available form of protection for your home.  I bought a few of these in 1999.  The ones I still have are still showing charged.  You have smoke detectors?  seat belts and car seats?  Why not a way to protect your home from a fire?  I've always had excellent experiences with Kidde products, and for what they do, I can't complain.  I wish more homes were prepared for a fire.  I've been in the fire protection trades for several years, including servicing extinguishers.  Today, I'm in the home security business and I'll go into homes that have that one fire extinguisher in the basement stairway that's 30 years old and the gauge shows it's discharged.  Why???Get one for your garage or workshop, one for the basement.  Put one in the hallway closet near the bedrooms.  And one on each habitable floor.  Get a BC model for your kitchen.  You'll have a very effective weapon in those few seconds where you need it.  Simple to use, they follow the industry standard:  PASS, pull, aim, squeeze, sweep.Fire extingushers are low maintenance, but they do require periodic inspection.  Make sure the gauge reads charged.  Make sure the nozzle isn't clogged, make sure there are no dents or corrosion in the cylinder.  These are a pressure vessel under 200 PSI of pressure.  They DO have a service life - I'd say 12 years as an industry standard (the service life until an extinguisher must be disassembled and be hydrostatically tested), unless Kidde says otherwise.  These are a one-time use deal:  once you use it, toss it and buy a new one.  Also, any time any kind of fire extingusher is used for any reason - even if it's for a second, you MUST MUST MUST replace it!  Do not ""test"" one by pressing the lever and discharging part of it!  When any fire extinguisher is discharged, even for a second, the powder will clog the valve seat, much like a Schrader valve in a tire, and the nitrogen gas used to propel the powder will slowly leak out.  With no pressurized gas, the powder will have no way of being discharged onto that fire when seconds are of critical importance.  The extingisher will still feel ""full"" but the gauge will indicate no pressure.These are a 2 1/2 pound unit with a 1A:10BC rating.  That's just a measurement of its firefighting power, 10BC is a rating that says when used by trained people, it will extingush 10 square feet of burning material.I'd say that after having the same units still ready to use for 13 years, this is a tested and true product, and for under $100 you can give your home and family that extra protection."

1830079,B0000025V4,Slow Down Isleys!,"Sentimental as this may seem the recent passing of Marvin Isley set me to bring out this CD that I baught twelve years ago and have listened to maybe twice since that time. Having been used to the some of the Isley's 70's music and having not heard their transitional material up to this point,this albums sound was a little shocking at the time. And it was actually something of a new sound for them. Any of those familiar with their often forgotton previous albumThe Real Dealhad actually dabbled in some new production elements while staying true to their 70's 3+3 sound the same as their first few 80's recordings had. Chris Jasper had a very strong play in this album in general and the result,being a keyboardist all too familiar with the world of electronics he basically just bumps that element in the music a great deal. In fact if it weren't for the strong presense of Ernie Isley's guitar solos this album would've actually sound mostly like the work of a multi-instrumentalist even though it wasn't. Overall this album has a pretty contemporary flavor for it's era but there are some elements and even distinct songs that still maintain their distinctive 3+3 sound. Basically Chris Jasper and the two elder Isley's Kelly and Rudy weren't exactly getting along as it seemed their presence in the recording process was somewhat relagated to backround vocals as Ron took the main leads. Well this album didn't change that but all the same the vocal backrounds are important to this album,as is the fact Chris Jasper and Ron share a good number of the leads as well. The album starts out with two ballads in ""Choosey Lover"" and ""Touch Me"". Not bad slow jams but the REAL meat comes with the title track,""I Need Your Body"" and ""Let's Make Love Tonight"",three seductive electronic soul/funk in the vein ofSexual Healingwith the mild Calypso flavored rhythm of the song as well. Even still Jasper's distinct touch on synthesizer on these tunes,which kind of flow together like a mini funk suite make them very distinctly Isley Brothers. After that the album,on what would've been Side B on the original vinyl or cassette tape really takes on a more diverse tone. ""Ballad For The Fallen Solider"" is one of the most powerful tunes on the album,a well produced rock n soul tune that tells the tale of a man recounting how his father went missing in action whilst fighting in Vietnam and even calling his congressman gets him nowhere. ""Slow Down Children"" is the one tune on this album with a decidely Isley 70's flavor,with that big bubbly synthesizer of Jasper,the slow crawling funk rhythm and the Isley's throaty harmonies dominating the production.  The last three cuts in contrast are the most modern. ""Way Out Love"" and the near instrumental,vocorder heavy ""Rock You Good"" both strongly showcase the early hip-hop/electro funk sound and although I am not sure I'd bet along with the title track these songs are probably very heavily sampled by hip-hop/scratch/electronic samplers. If they aren't they probably should be because their sound was influencial on much of that. ""Gettin Over"" is more of a new wave styled electro/dance tune which showcases the Isley's moving forward into the 80's with rock and not just R&B; because,considering their place in the music's history they just saw how rock,R&B;,soul,blues,funk and hip-hop all kind of bled together after a point. Even if this album marked the end of the Isley's acclaimed 3+3 lineup this found them on something of a commercial upswing. Not only that but they did so by continuing their long tradition of adapting their own sound to the new musical generation without losing their identity."
2983381,B000UX6THK,"The most haunting, and mistreated, show in the history of television","When Twin Peaks aired on television, none could have predicted how the murder of Laura Palmer would move not only the town's citizens, who knew Laura as a generous and good-hearted teenager, but also millions of viewers. Indeed, over thirty episodes, they would discover a community of five thousand citizens who hide, behind closed doors and curtains, dangerous secrets. With the investigation done by the FBI agent Dale Cooper and the Twin Peaks sheriff Harry Truman, they uncover those same secrets and try to answer the one-million dollar question.Who killed Laura Palmer?Though the main characters are Agent Dale and Sheriff Truman, Twin Peaks is an ensemble show since each episode narrates a complete day, which includes the lives of Twin Peaks residents, and the Laura Palmer investigation. For each episode, we witness characters' pains and joys of their lives, but we slowly find out that Laura herself was not who she was and that dangerous forces haunt the woods of Twin Peaks. Not only that, we also witness an awesome romance between Audrey Horne and Special Agent Dale Cooper, which gave to its actress Sherilyn Fenn the success she deserved.As such, the show itself can switch emotions very quickly, going from drama to comedy, then towards pure terror. As such, the show is not your usual drama-investigation-soap opera. Even the music that Angelo Badalamenti did completely differs to what was done in the eighties and today. It haunts your heart as tunes like Falling, Audrey's Dance, Laura's Theme, and the Woods' Theme play in the background.Though my favorite characters were Dale Cooper, Audrey Horne, Andy, Lucy, Shelly, the Log Lady, and the whole Palmer family, I have to admit that the most unforgettable remains BOB, played by the excellent Frank Silva, set dresser for the pilot and a David Lynch collaborator whose scenes in the show have spooked me for days. Especially the short ones he did in certain episodes.About the other special Features, I appreciated everything this DVD set offers, although I wish they could have shown the funny Sesame Street parody of Twin Peaks.As a final note, to everybody interested in Twin Peaks, it is important to know that the show's broadcaster, ABC, horribly mistreated the series. As explained in the making of, ABC was uncomfortable with the show narration and shocking content, especially coming from the director who did Blue Velvet, movie that shocked the public and industry with its sexual and sadomasochistic scenes. But what really unsettled the ABC bosses was the sudden popularity of a show that they had no hope in the first place. So they forced the creators to reveal the murderer's identity in the middle of the second season, which they unfortunately did. This was a foolish idea since it hurt the story's plot device and forced the creators to come up with less-spectacular storylines. As such, the Laura Palmer story goes for seventeen episodes (pilot included) and remains the best of what is in Twin Peaks. Of the last thirteen episodes, they feel to me like a jumble of good ideas that don't hit their full potential. Of course, the Windom Earle events are great, but what happens with Little Nicky, James and Irene, and the Pine Weasel doesn't strike the same chord as Laura Palmer's story. And with what happens with the Audrey Horne/Cooper romance, I prefer to stick with the first seventeen episodes who make a complete series by themselves. Speaking of that Audrey Horne/Cooper romance, Kyle MacLachlan explains in the making-of why he asked the storyline to be dropped. However, I tend to believe more the explanations Mark Frost, Bob Engels and Sherilyn Fenn said, especially after seeing on YouTube interviews with Sherilyn Fenn, and the ""2011 Twin Peaks Convention Q&A; Dinner Meeting"", where Sheryl Lee and Lenny Von Dohlen talked about a certain cast member I will not name, but whom they found unpleasant. And to me, I think stopping that plotline due to some behind-the-scenes conflict hurt the show as much as the revelation of Laura Palmer's mystery. Especially since that romance was supposed to be the next major plot line of the second season.So why the Five stars even though I think the last thirteen episodes are not up to par with the first seventeen episodes. Because the setting and universe this series presents remains unique and light-years to what is done on television. It also offered the chance for shows to tell their stories like movies instead of the usual talk-talk in television, and Twin Peaks, even years after its unfair cancellation, still remains in the collective mind of the public, of its fans, and of the industry. Indeed, shows like The X-Files, Lost, Desperate Housewives, Once Upon a Time, Riget, the Killing, movies like The Blair Witch Project, and video games like Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Deadly Premonition owe a lot to Twin Peaks. If there is one thing that makes them different from Twin Peaks, it is that they never repeated the same mistake that Twin Peaks did.God knows what would have happened if the show had been done either in syndication, or on cable channels like HBO who started to bring out excellent series like Tales from the Crypt. Maybe Twin Peaks would have had its third, and probably final season, done."

1535151,B00I056QGO,"I don't like big bots, I cannot lie.","I think it's only fair to point out, I was a huge supporter of this game. I clocked over 100 hours in the beta and I loved my time. I bought the collectors edition of the game.I just loved the roleplaying experience and the crafting which never happened to me before in any MMO. I love all the lore of the Elder Scroll series, so I figured if all else failed that wouldn't.I even reviewed this game and gave it five stars right here on Amazon.I was wrong, not only that, I was damned wrong and I'm sorry if I caused anyone to waste their money -- not that my opinion matters to anyone that muchThen launch happened, and I played for about 30 hours, and in my time, I seen bots flying just under the ground, harvesting ore, moving so fast, I simply could not report them. It was then I knew, I just didn't like the game's feeling anymore.That was one thing I overlooked in all my time with the beta. How easily this game could be exploited, and botted. It's a botters paradise.The public dungeons, the strength of a system that had never been tried before give or take in any MMO, was turned against itself by the botters. Talk about an immersion killing experience. Seeing twenty bots standing over a boss, killing them so quickly you can't even hit them.I overlooked this would happen. The developers who had millions invested in the game? Shouldn't have. It's hard to believe all the feedback they got, missed it as well.However I have seen people defend the game against the bots, saying Elder Scrolls Online as a game shouldn't be blamed due to the bot problem. It's the bad people's fault. That's wishful thinking and boreline insane.The game also had broken quests, that helped, along with the bots, kill immersion. First it started with small quests like the frog race, then it moved to major bugs that broke the first dungeon in the AD zone. Dungeons are make or break a experience for many players. If you can't even proceed through a dungeons what impression does that give?Then the bugs followed me to Grahtwood, a npc asked me to jump inside a portal, where the NPC wasn't even there -- I tried this a few times over weeks, reported it, still not fixed.But before that, it was the fighters guild bugged quest. Everytime I really immersed myself in the game, and tried to enjoy the story. There was a bot, or a unexcusable glitch that somehow broke the quest or stopped progress through a zone. How they got past the beta, is the scary part.Hell they had to pull some quests from the game all together. Just to fix them. Forget that. I have never seen a MMO do that before at launch.&#34;All MMOs have bugs&#34; stop with the insane defending. This game played like a middle stage beta, there is no excuse for it. I have been a part of every MMO launch since and before Vanilla WoW, and this was one of the three worst I have ever seen. This wasn't a mere server problem, or a couple of bugged quests. This was a broken game.So in the end? The game I was so sure I would love due to my Beta time, I ended up quiting maybe faster than any MMO I ever invested anything into -- maybe tying Neverwinter for worst gaming investment ever.The game I hated in the beta, Wildstar, I ended up loving, and I'm in one of the top raiding guilds. So that was a pleasant surprise and I advice checking that game out, as long as you don't expect it to reinvent the wheel. Carbine are great developers.However stay away from ESO, it's end game is nothing but grind grind grind, the bot problem isn't ending anytime soon, and the adventure zone patch will not save the game. If anything will add more bugs.Give it six months. And if you are bored with everything else? Maybe -- maybe, check it out.Otherwise this is a easy pass. Skyrim is more fun. Hell so are Oblivion and Morrowind (my favorite). There are also too many MMOs to try right now, to invest in this.I'm glad some people still play this game and like it. I just wasn't one of them."

1875048,B000JFY0AC,Flip the bird,"Truth be told, I have never been much of a Lil' Flip fan other than ""Game Over"". But I still decided to give his latest album I Need Mine a try. This album was actually supposed to be released back in 2005 but his label shelved it, and it's easy to see why.If you're planning on listening to this album, make sure you don't have much to do for the rest of the day because it's hard to sit through. And it's not because most of the things that Flip has to say are uninspired; it's also because now he added on another whole album's worth of material on here, thus resulting in the whole thing clocking in at almost 2-1/2 hours. In addition, there are two remixes of remixes on here (""Fly Boy"" and ""You'z a Trick""), and the only saving grace to either of them is UGK's appearance on the second ""You'z a Trick"".And Flip usually uses the same subject matter: either shooting people up or bragging about his success -- oh, and an obligatory song for the ladies (see the Mya-assisted ""Flippin'"", which features a sample probably best remembered from Heavy D and the Boyz' ""Nuttin' But Love""). Speaking of that, though, guest stars are another issue. Nate Dogg and Lyfe Jennings do add nice hooks to the respective tracks ""Take You There"" and ""Ghetto Mindstate"", and Yukmouth sounds fine on ""Stay Ballin'"", as do Three Six Mafia on ""3,2,1 Go"". But most of the other guests fall flat, especially the boring hooks by some crooner called Big Shasta (see ""The Souf"" or ""We Go Make It Out da Hood""). And as for ""Sorry Lil' Mama"", well, Z-Ro and Nutt definitely live up to their names.Flip isn't all that when he's by himself either, as evidenced by the boring ""Warrior"" or ""I Just Wanna Tell U"" (and the noodle brand is pronounced RAH-men, not RAY-men; why can't rappers pronounce that?). There are also a couple of formulaic songs that fail to impress, like the shake-that-ass vibe of ""Make It Shake"" and the song with a message, ""Single Mother"". And on ""Hall of Fame Graveyard"", he gives props to deceased rappers, but he also zings himself when he asks why all the good rappers are dead while the wack rappers are still alive.There are other bad songs on here, but I didn't feel like listening to 37 tracks worth of material again to pinpoint them. And when your album is that long and it isn't even good, well...I shouldn't have to explain anything else. Even though I only downloaded this Lil' Flip album, if you want it, you're welcome to it because I sure don't need mine.Anthony Rupert"
1875190,B000KCHZK6,"Bland, Boring, Blah",This cd is so bland! Every single song sounds the same. It's almost so bad that you think there is just one continuous 45 minute song! Her voice is not that special either. It's almost like listening to Patsy Cline on downers. She makes Enya sound like a rock star. At least Enya does vary the sound SOME. That album cover makes me cringe. Could she have chosen an uglier frock? The best song isn't that great. She says over and over...It's not tooooo late....ooooohoooooh....it's not to late...for loooove! I think she knows that people will buy this cd no matter how bad it is. She needs to try a little harder and spice it up a little.
367131,B002NU6FC2,"Didn't blow my mind like Craze and old world 1MR did when I first tried them, but it gets the job done and it's cheap.","Well, I've taken almost every pre-workout there is.  I was having fun with Craze, but it stopped working for me so I decided to try Bullnox.  It comes on like C4, but doesn't last quite as long.  Gives me enough energy to get through lifting and cardio workouts.  Doesn't mess with my stomach.  Kicks in about 15 minutes after taking it.  I have fruit punch flavor and it is awesome, but I really don't care about taste (used to love 1MR old formula and that tasted like poison and death).  Overall a decent pre with some traces of other useful stuff in it."
1872257,B000B5XSXU,Evocative and Inspiring,"I now realize the right way to listen to Jackson Browne.  Just his voice and a guitar or piano.  For 40 years he has written and performed powerful songs and anthems, and whether you agree or disagree with his political views, he sings every lyric with conviction.  His rendition of 'Looking East' is worth getting the entire CD, or just download that song.  You will be transformed in that 5 and a half minutes."
1469456,B003ZULWQI,Terrible OLD graphics - waste of 7 bucks,"I just bought this and RAGE, both for like 6 bucks. Not expecting much but Rage rocked. This looks like 2005 at best. Things 'pop-out' of background (like brighter/different colors), had small pauses when walking through large fields, creatures and people's walk doesn't match their speed (like old games) i.e. they do the step-slide. Attacked by a dog that's obvious front view/side view/rear view type thing... overall a big let down. Again, maybe should've played this before Rage, but difference is night and day. I spend like 15 minutes in this game and don't think I'll bother playing it again- just too cheesy and just plain old looking. I LOVED Fallout3 and thought this would be similar but it wasn't. FYI I have QuadCore 3.6g CPU/12G RAM and decent vid card. I would recommend saving your money (even at just $6). And if you haven't played yet- go get Rage if you're looking for bargain time waster.Also as one other review said- mine had homemade looking sticker w/serial and 'Jack of all Games'printed on it. DVD case was plain black- no graphics or inserts of any kind, no manual or anything except outer box and DVD. I wonder if this is a real copy? But the main issue is that it looks HORRIBLE. Seriously. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about- this looks bad. Like good for maybe 2002. Fallout is 20x better looking and smoother. This looks like small team in a basement made game. Played 15min and just going to delete it- that bad."

50394,B005C31FJA,Great for watching netflix on your phone,"I bought this dock because I won't have a television for about a month and wanted to be able to watch some shows on my phone. The dock is just a little piece of plastic, but I love having it.  It's so much more convenient than propping my phone up on various objects.  I also use it when I'm using speakerphone or playing music so that the speakers aren't muffled. (Ideally, you'd have external speakers.)If you didn't catch this in one of the other reviews - You have to pop out a plastic piece in the cradle of the dock if you use a case on your bionic.  Otherwise your phone won't fit in the dock.I give 4/5 stars since the dock is overpriced.  But it's useful."
2529560,B00005JOVM,A Great Game But An Awful Movie,"I love both Bloodrayne game and so after seeing that they were making the movie I decided what the hell and bought the first movie a few months ago, and what a terrible choice that was especially after learning who the Director was Uwe(How The Hell He Gets The Money To Make His God Awful Movies)Boll.  The movie is almost so far away rom what the game was I about stopped watching after the first five minutes, but if that wasn't awful enough the acting was beyond idiotic and so atrocious it was laughable.  Of all the actors and actresses who starred in this sludge I was most disappointed with the renown actor Ben Kingsley who you have to wonder what this great actor is doing in this piece of crap.  Of course you also can't have this crap-o-rama without the usual sex scenes which after viewing are also pretty idiotic, the storyline from the amazon editorial pretty much sums up what this piece of garbage is about, so unless you're drunk or stoned I very much doubt you'll find any entertainment quality about this so called movie at all.  A a little off topic I give kudos to Jennifer Garner I really don't know if it's true or not but supposedly Uwe Boll tried to get her for a movie and she turned him down flat a great choice on her part.  So until Uwe's financial backers give up on him(I still don't see how he can get anyone to finance his crap movies) all I say is definitely pass over any movie made or directed by this fool because if not you'll really regret the choice as I have after watching this piece of garbage..."

3743320,B0002Z9KE0,Works as describe and fit great,"This worked perfectly for my 2003 Ford Excursion.  It fit right over the tire and gave me the extra height I wanted to load bikes on the roof and a car top carrier.  Seems very sturdy and well made.  The bag that comes with it is a nice bonus feature.  I see what others have mentioned though about the adjustable step and folding it up in the bag.  If you place the step in any position except for the lowest, you will not be able to store it in the bag folded.  All that said, it will still fold up in that position and you could easily put a bunge around it and store it that way."

1299667,B000XXBHA6,Item was NOT like it was described. Be careful!!,"I have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem, but I got literally 8 plug-ins, and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain. It's like I got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends. Soooo it's pretty much useless to me. I guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them, I guess you could plug this into it but I really see no point. I would've shipped it back I lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss. I think I payed like $8 for it so whatever. I would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end."
1505085,B007FTE2VW,Unacceptable,"I paid $67.00 for day one delivery of this game.  I spent 1.5 hours setting it up and 30 minutes in the mandatory tutorial.  30 minutes in game and I get booted and told the servers are busy go try another server.  Also, redo the mandatory tutorial and your city doesn't carry over.  The maps are way too small and they've streamlined so much I'm not sure if I can get into it.  Almost like city planning for idiots.  Irrespective of gameplay I rate this game a 1 star, first impressions are the most important and when you ask for that much money you NEED to have a smooth launch.  Instead of writing this review I should be playing the game.  This launch is unacceptable.Update: Day two.  Got 30 minutes into the game.  Crashed again.  Upon reloading the game froze at checking for updates.  I spent 30 minutes in forums and found a sim recovery file.  I ran this and it downloaded a large file.  It took well over an hour. Restarted the game and it froze again while checking for updates. As of right now this game is 100 % unplayable.Yes, I paid extra for shipping to get this day one.  I've heard reviewers got separate servers so likely they aren't experiencing what people who PAID for this game are."

Instead, it uses puffed rice and soy crisps as filler, lowering the calorie count by diluting the more nutritious ingredients with bland ones. The bar is also disappointingly dry. In short, I was left balking at the premium price for a product that's neither satisfying nor especially good for you."

260433,B000KOQ9HY,It works as advertised ... at least so far!,"We are a multi-cat household, so we give carpet cleaners a pretty good workout, particularly during the summer what with grass/weed eating and regurgitating.  So far, this product has done an excellent job of removing stains.  Now we are pretty diligent in cleaning up, so we have yet to try it on a stain that has been dried on the carpet for a few days.One other point in this product's favor:  Spray bottles often work better when spraying straight ahead, rather than down.  This was particularly true with the previous brand we used, which typically clogged up when spraying down.  But, of course, when using a carpet cleaner, spraying down is about all you do (unless your walls are carpeted!).  This product has no problem staying unclogged when spraying down.  In short, this is the best product of its kind that we know of."
1823096,B000000ORX,Fine return to form,"Here JM displays a new-found sense of balance and harmony in her life and music. Night Ride Home proves that the creative embers were glowing brightly again. Her languid voice is accorded poetic justice by the sparse backing on themes eternal. Religious symbolism surfaces on Passion Play and Slouching Towards Bethlehem - the latter an adaptation of a Yeats poem. The topic of growing old, gracefully treated in Nothing Can Be Done and Come In From The Cold, is brilliantly balanced by the teenage romance of Ray's Dad's Cadillac, in which Joni puts one over Rickie Lee Jones, one of her followers. Savour these lines: &quot;Ray's dad teaches maths/I'm a dunce, a decimal in his class/when it comes to mathematics/I get static in the attic.&quot; Well this is music - not maths - and Joni gets five out of five for composition and performance."
1750434,B00132H4OE,does a great job,"where I work I use these every day, several times a day.  The only drawback I found is there isn't a belt clip on the little guy, so I end up carrying it around in my back pocket, which isn't the most comfortable thing to sit on.  If you do carry yours in a pocket make sure to check on the thumb screw every once in awhile cause it tends to work its way loose and fall off in your pocket. This is a bit of a problem because you then have to hope the nut is still in the pocket too.  I haven't lost any parts but have spent a few minutes cussing myself for not checking more often.  The other little annoying thing is the razor has to but exactly perfect for the little guy to close right.  If its not just right you can't get the protective cover back in place.  I must say though, its so much better than the retractable holders that are always letting the blade slide back into the handle when you try to scrape something off a window.  If I could clip it to my belt I would give it five stars."

1602937,B002866EWM,Didn't Go Bananas Over the Flavor,"Cheerios is a staple and a comfort food to all of us who grew up eating breakfast sitting in front of the TV while watching Ray Raynor. Or whatever classic children's programming they showed outside Chicago.Although you could always doctor up your bowl with sliced fruit, Apple Cheerios was a welcome addition to the General Mills product line. But sometimes it's better to quit while you're ahead.Now we have--Banana Nut Cheerios! This is not a good breakfast choice. For one thing, banana is really hard to artificially reproduce. I don't know why. But companies keep trying, and it's almost always a disaster. Things that taste like authentic bananas, ie, banana bread, use authentic bananas. I don't know who was involved in the marketing focus group for Banana Nut Cheerios, but maybe they were all having sinus issues that day and couldn't taste a thing.Banana Nut Cheerio tastes strongly of FAKE banana, which is worse than when a real banana gets all black on the outside and mushy on the inside. I couldn't taste the ""nut"" element because the fake banana was so overwhelming. And it was pervasive. It took forever for the aftertaste to go away.Even my dogs rejected a little Cheerio ""treat"" when we came in from our walk.No one in the family would eat more than one serving, so eventually we threw the nearly-full box away. It was funny because one of my co-workers told the EXACT same story about the Banana Nut Cheerios she bought for her family.So if you have little kids that have weird tastes  (and remember that some kids will even eat asphalt and laundry detergent, although I think that's a mineral deficiency) this might be okay. But for everyone else, stick with the original, or the apple flavor.At least, for your dog's sake."

Unlike oil, the brush you use will have to be cleaned with acetone or you can throw it away.Pros:- doesn't darken the woodCons:- doesn't penetrate wood- sticky (everything will stick to it until it's dry; flies, ants, leaves, hair, etc.)- varnish; not oil- need to clean brush with acetoneI'm glad I didn't try it directly on my expensive teak patio set.

1314128,B00004SPW9,An amazing game that is certainly not for everyone,"Vagrant Story is the kind of game that is either love it or hate it. There really isn't too much in between. It features great characters and one of the greatest stories in any game released to date, but the amount of attention that must be paid to weapons and stats (along with some redundancy in battles) can really turn a lot of people off.Let me start with a bit of the story. In the game you play the role of Ashley Riot. A man who is entrusted with the duty of being a Riskbreaker (essentially a one man army) who is entrusted to enter the lost city of Lea Monde to try and figure out an assassination plot that he has been framed for. At the start of the game this is all you know. You know that Ashley went to Lea Monde and was never seen again. Three days after he left, they declared him the murderer. Now you have to find out what happened in the city of Lea Monde and uncover the truth. With a supporting cast of characters lead by the wonderfully evil Sidney Lostarrot, Vagrant Story weaves an amazing tale of lost pasts and hidden truths (with some black magic and whatnot thrown in). Be aware though, the story isn't all happy like you will be apt to find in the Final Fantasy series, it goes much deeper into human emotion and psyche.As for the gameplay, well, this is where it is either won or lost. Essentially the game is a dungeon crawler that has you wandering the dungeons of Lea Monde until you find a neccesary item to continue traversing through. There is a lot of backtracking but luckily half way through you learn a teleport ability that cuts down on that. You can think of it as similar to the backtracking in Resident Evil games for those familiar (find a locked door, need such and such key/item, find item/key elsewhere, go back and proceed).All the while you will be encountering various monsters of different classes. While it may not seem like much, monster class is critical to how effective you are at the game. You have the ability to craft your own weapons and armor, each one can have special affinities to different classes. Essentially this means you will want a weapon that is effective against each different enemy class. This is where all the in depth stat management comes in (as well as a lot of use of the EQUIP function....). Attacking enemies is done in real time and allows you to pretty much attack indefinately as long as your timing is good for chaining attacks together. On top of that you can target individual body parts on every monster to weaken different stats (legs = movement, head = intelligence, and so on and so forth). By doing this and inflicting enough damage to one body part you can effectively nullify your enemies strength. Although it can be apt to take quite a while.Graphically, the game is fairly bland even for PS1 standards. It is made almost with a sketch visual, where there are multiple lines to every section of the characters (similar to what you would see in preproduction sketch books). Although it does work extremely well and seems perfectly natural in the twisted reality that is Lea Monde. All scenes are done in the same graphics engine (no CG) and there is no voice acting so all words are said in speech bubbles. Again, odd, but it works.The game is definately quirky and is definately a bit of a niche game. It is pretty long and requires the player to really get in depth into what they are doing to truly appreciate all the work and the amazing world that has been imbedded into Vagrant Story. If you can do that, it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences you can have. If not, then consider your self one of the masses, because that seems to be the general view of the game."
1556470,B000G176CI,ORGASMICALLY GOOD!,"This soup with reduced sodium is the desired path to soup nirvana. It's the best lentil variety I've ever sampled. It's less at Stop N Shop but you have to carry home 12 unattached cans, so the free delivery to your door via Amazon is enticing and desired. I'm not a vegetarian but I do adore hot soup during the winter. Amy also markets a strictly lentil soup which they sell at Costco, but the reduced sodium content with the vegetable addition is much better."

My teeth are sensetive, but I can still use regular paste so I tried out this flavor.  I read some reviews on how good it is but I hated the taste of it.  One person said it tasted like shaving cream and I should have believed them.  It does leave that taste in your mouth like you got too much cream on your face and some gets in your mouth.  Not a good taste and it didn't work that well I don't think.  Anyways, I wouldn't recommend this style but the Sensodyne in this same shape is awesome."

1299856,B0015RIN6U,It's an industry standard for a reason!,"The Korg Pitchblack is probably, along with the BOSS TU-2/TU-3, considered one of the industry standards for compact pedal bypass tuners for use with guitar and bass.  Both the TU-2 and Pitchblack are excellent, and I don't really have an opinion yet as to which is better.  However, there are some strengths of the Korg Pitchblack that may lead you to prefer it over other tuners.  The primary draw here is the bright light-up display with wide color bars.  The tuner displays the note you are closest to, and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch, marked by the green light in the middle (almost like an airplane landing guide).  But not only do the lights indicate tone by turning on and off, they actually dim and transition into one another as you go across those semi-tones.  You could argue, therefore, that the visual guide is giving you a lot more precision than you would get from a simple on/off light.  The tuner works quickly and reliably.The build quality is outstanding, and it's true bypass.  When you step on the pedal, the tuner is on and the guitar signal is off.  The switch is also of the ""soft button"" variety, similar to what you find on some Vox pedals and many boutiques.  It has a nice feel to it, though it could be easier to bump if it's in a high traffic area.This is a great tuner at a reasonable price.  It really comes down to user preference, but I've heard many guitarists prefer this one because of its high accuracy and visibility."

1772347,B002PUTC0M,Great gauge till the battery dies,"I am a professional mechanic and this was by far the best tire gauge I've ever used--- till the battery died in less than a year.The battery is extremely difficult to replace if you follow the instructions in the owner's manual.Two screws need to be removed that you can't see and seem to have been installed with Loc-Tite or tightened by a gorilla.One screw broke the tip off a quality screwdriver, the other screw's head stripped out.I gave it two stars only because it was a slow day and I was able to devote a few hours to replacing the battery.Otherwise I would have thrown the thing away and gave it one star.I may have been tempted to buy a new gauge just like it though, it's a great gauge other than the battery.My advice is to ignore the battery replacement instructions in the owners manual and instead remove the allan head screw (metric) in the back and push the entire gauge head out of the rubber. At least this way you can see the screws you need to remove.Make sure to keep the owner's manual, you'll need it just to see how the gauge comes apart.Almost two years later:Still the best gauge I've ever owned but don't make the mistake I did and use it to check calcium filled agricultural tires, it corrodes the sensor circuitry. Now I know better, will be ordering another."

1639914,B004P13CN2,No effect for either me or my husband,"My husband is an energy drink addict on the weekends in his attempts to stay up all night. I thought maybe if these worked for him, he could cut down on his energy drink intake and therefore cut down on all the calories and sugar that comes with it. Unfortunately, these did absolutely nothing for him.I tried them as well, thinking that it might just be him. I don't really drink anything with caffeine besides a coffee every few days sometimes and do not ever drink energy drinks or anything of the sort. I tried drinking one of these an hour before I would normally start getting tired at night for four nights in a row. And all four nights, I was asleep before my usual bedtime. These might work great for some people (as shown by how many good reviews these have) but they didn't have any effect on either me or my husband. Looks like my husband will be making due with his energy drinks for a while longer."

1871434,B0009XNUK0,Great Compilation,"Despite all the controversy that has occured with Michael Jackson, he is truly the king of pop and he truly has one of the best recording voices ever.  You can't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop, but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself.  THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including ""I'll Be There"", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.It is wonderful reliving hits such as ""I Want You Back"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Thriller"", ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"", ""Don't Stop Til You Get Enough"", and etc... 4 stars."

3720771,B006Q7YFLQ,Not good for cats - too hard to eat,"With all due respect to Amazon reviewer ""Book and Dog Lover"", I can't imagine any cat would enjoy these treats.  Because they're freeze-dried, they are too hard for a cat to chew without an incredible amount of effort.  Even as I held the treat in my fingers, my poor cat could not bite off a chunk.  Are we supposed to add water? I don't know because there are no feeding instructions on the packaging.  I attempted to add some water it didn't reconstitute anything.  The treats remained hard as rocks.  Breaking up the piece into smaller chunks didn't seem to make a difference either.  Plus, the addition of water suddenly made the treats unappealing to my cat.  Apparently all she liked was smelling and licking the sticky powder coating around the treat."
1488368,B0050SXVK8,God of War Double Feature,"God of War Chains of Olympus, and God of War Ghost of Sparta were both for the PSP. Now it comes out for the PS3 in HD, in oneBlu-Ray disc title called God of War: Origins Collection. Chains of Olympus you play as Kratos before the events of the first God of War. So Kratos will be still serving the gods. He's sent in to help stop a Persian invasion. The Persians are using a giant basilisk to help. Like God of War fashion, you battle it throughout parts of the level. Similar to the Hydra in GOW1. After your battle you learn that the gods are in trouble, and the world has turned dark. You go through the Sun God's temple, to Hades, and Tartarus as some of the locations. The story is not the best of the GOW's, but it's ok. You also learn a lot about the titans imprisonment in Tartarus.Some of the enemies are hard to dodge unlike in the previous games. Namely the panther type creature, and theundead with the twin swords. There seems to be a slight delay for the dodge move.You can parry in this game. Ever since GOW2 gave you the golden fleece, it's the standard for the rest of the GOW's.Zeus's gauntlet, that you collect in you weaponry, is a close range weapon that deals tons of damage. You don't get thisearly on unfortunatly, and it's too bad.God of War Ghost of Sparta has improved much more than Chains of Olympus. You are on a search for your brother who was also mentioned in GOW1.He was taken away, and you find out why on your journey to find him. The gods do not want Kratos to go, but of course he refuses them. You travel a lot more here than in Chains of Olympus locations. You might remember the ship level in GOW1. You start the game sailing again. A giant sea creature chases you from the ocean to even on land. Yes, another giant monster in the beginning. This one will show up a good number of times. There are many different levels here ranging from the city of Atlantis, a lava mountain, snowy areas, and even Kratos's city of Sparta.If you've played the previous GOW's, you'll realize quickly in the game why he's so desparate to save his brother. There are a lot of reasons. There are flash back events in the game that give you a little more insight each time. The story is my second favorite to GOW2 as first.The combat is improved here as well from Chains of Olympus. The dodge button responds good again. The twins sword enemies are back, and still have lightning fast attacks. So it's best to just keep them at a range and attack. In here Kratos will be able to arm himself with the Spartan spear and shield. You can throw spears here without selecting in a menu to do so. The melee range is not as good as your double blades, but it can finish enemies faster. The combos are somewhat slow as well. But if you put together different throwing attacks with a combination for close combat, it's a great weapon.The developers have learned from the mistakes of Chains of Olympus, and it shows with Ghost of Sparta. The Blu-Ray disc is a buy for Ghost of Sparta alone. Chains would just be a bonus. It's still a decent game. It's really a plus going from the small PSP screen to a bigger HD screen to play these games."

1572431,B0010YA02S,The best greens powder around!,"This powder is very easy to drink.  I've added it to smoothies, had it plain (mixed w/ water, of course), and I've mixed it with a bit of water and then added several ounces of unsweetened almond milk and all were palatable.  The chocolate gives it a rich, dark chocolate flavor, which I know sounds not so hot - greens w/ chocolate! You'll be surprised how much it adds to the taste.  I drink it every morning - provides energy and a feeling of fullness.  I like the fullness part because if I stop for coffee on the way to work, I'm not so hungry that I buy a scone.I have also tried their greens powder and the taste is not for everyone. As a lover of that ""green"" taste, I don't have a problem with it. Others have told me they find the greens powder impossible to drink plain and impossible to disguise in a smoothie.I've not tried the berry or the greens powder for kids. If you're new to drinking this type of thing and you are able to have chocolate, I'd start with this one."

3033106,B0014FAIX4,Please don't buy this.  And tell Paramount why.,"The music replacements aren't as bad as you've heard from the other reviews.They're worse.You don't even have to be familiar with ""The Fugitive"" to know that something is horribly wrong as soon as you start listening beyond the opening credits.  (Actually, before that -- since the music replacements start during each episode's pre-credits teaser, which for this season is simply a repeat of a scene that occurs within the episode itself.)Absolutely nothing distinguishes this new music, other than its bombast and blandness.  You can tell the composer was trying for a '60s dramatic TV show flavor.  Didn't work, to put it mildly.It's interesting that a reviewer below used the word ""abomination"" for this hack job.  That's exactly what it is -- and it harks back to Vestron Video's botched 1984 VHS release of ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" where they replaced a lot of the original music.  THAT movie eventually got released with the right score -- took just 17 years, when MGM/UA issued the the DVD in 2001.We can't wait 17 years for ""The Fugitive"" to have the original music.  Please: Do not buy this, and demand that Paramount get it right."

223223,B00075M1VO,Sunbeam 730-811 heating pad plus massage,"This Sunbeam 730-811 heating pad plus massage is a good idea in theory but it is really too small.  The internal workings all ended up in a big ball all rolled up when you use it and it heats up for awhile.  It also doesn't have enough cushioning covering the vibrating mechanism, and it feels like sitting against something obtrusive all the time.  I have back problems so I thought this would help...well, it maybe lasted four months and I see amazon has a one month return policy so I have to see if I can get my money back from the manufacturer.  I paid over $25.00 for this and it better last more than four months!  The pad had a hot smell and it turned off with both lights on.... it shorted out and a good thing it didn't start on fire.  It sure smelled hot.  I'll try to return it and tell you if I got my money back."

1299438,B000V4YFLA,"Great distortion box, fairly versatile","I've had this pedal for over a year now and I've been getting more and more into tube amps and I've learned to appreciate how the intricacies of how all of this gear works together (amps, guitars and pedals).When I first reviewed this pedal, I had just gotten a new solid state amp and I was very let down. After I jumped to tube amps, I grew to appreciate it a little bit more, but I was using it wrong; I'd just match the output of my amp and goose the distortion level to use it as a 2nd channel/gain stage. I thought it lent a good distorted tone to my playing, but I dismissed it as just an ""OK"" box.Flash forward: This thing kills! It belongs in front of a tube amp; period. I've found, as all before me, that dirt boxes are virtually useless on solid state amps.The D III works very well as a clean boost: Max the volume, set tone to taste and the roll the distortion all the way back. This will blast your clean amp into overdrive, without much coloration on your tone. This is my preferred setting as I can use it to push my single channel tube amps into dirty territory like I would before, using it as a second channel, but with that natural tube sound. Any pedal that gives you some more ""umph"" without altering the original sound of your amp is a beautiful thing.Dial the output down some, and crank the volume on the amp a bit more, the distortion knob really adds some nice saturated gain that increases sustain and can creep up on getting a significantly dirtier tone. I found that this is reminiscent of a classic tube screamer; while not tonally identical, this can really help push a hotter amp into overdrive to get some heavy, heavy tones, while retaining the sound of the amp's natural distortion.In between, you can dial in some classic crunch tones suitable for rock and blues or just a smooth overdrive. After playing around with the knobs, I found that this is a very versatile and well voiced pedal. I actually prefer it to tube screamers and its clones as that's been done to death; the D III is conceptually the same, but it just sounds ""different"" that the TS and it doesn't let go of the low end.For the price, this is a fantastic buy. It delivers enough output to be used as a fantastic clean boost, and there's enough gain on tap to dial in just about any rock tone you'd want, save for modern high gain metal."

1862171,B00007KK7V,Very Beautiful,"More slow sustains and less variation than Mezzanine, but more deeply empathetic and emotive than that release.  I am not a fan of Sinead O'Conner, but this album could change that.  Robert (3D) Del Naja did a hellava job reining in her vocals, even without Nellee Hooper contributing as much anymore.  I just wish they had Sara Jay (Dissolved Girl) return.  She has such a great voice.  I can understand why Liz Frazer was unavailable, though...she's getting a lot of offers, including on the Lord of the Rings soundtrack.  The sound on this album is very warm, without the extremely intense low-end resolve of Mezzanine.  It seems more balanced and neutral, though some might find it less sonically impactful.  I find it more forgiving to the speakers and the ears while the soft gray character to the sound is more fitting for this style.  Good job, Tim Young."

1859065,B00005USBH,Possessed by a Manilow-singing demon?,"Barry Manilow, the butt of too many jokes, was one of the best at what he did.He wrote and sang simple pop songs and ballads that ingrained themselves into your brain with sinister ease.I know this, because as a young kid during the 70's, his music was inescapable. And although I doubt I've listened to ""It's A Miracle"" ONCE since I was twelve......I still remembered every word.The song came on the CD in my car, and there I was, singing along without missing a beat or a word or a note. It was scary, like I was possessed by some Manilow-singing demon. (Now THAT would have been a great Buffy episode, no?)There are songs here that, like it or not, are in the pop pantheon of great singles.They can be (and often are) quite dumb, but they are harder to shake than herpes.""Mandy"", ""I Write The Songs"", ""Bandstand Boogie"", ""Weekend in New England"", ""Daybreak""...the tune, ""Can't Smile Without You"", if played three times in a row, will give you a cavity. True.Is it me, or does R. Kelly merely copy ""Copacabana"" with his ludicrous ""Trapped in the Closet"" series? And you can't SING his like you can Barry's.Seriously. Travel to the most remote outpost in Siberia, find a little hut sheltering a small family with no running water, electricity or heat. If you look any one of those family members in the eye, and say out loud, ""Her name was Lola..."", you will hear back, in mangled but perfectly understandable English, ""...she VASS a CHO-gurl!""Manilow is everywhere."

Instead we're thrown, the unexciting and unimaginative Erotica. Not only is the album of demo-like quality but, most of it's craft (or lack there of) has little substance to it. For instance, the 'did I do it?' track, a complete rap song by some unknown male rapper and Madonna utters not one single word, this song also shares the exact same music as 'the waiting', another bland track. the subpar mastering  and stripped sound comes off more underdeveloped and low budget than an actual audio effect; a result, much of the songs become disposable and/or unlistenable. Although this album is her most controversial record content wise, it's also the least remembered of the bunch. Most people don't recall an album from her at this point in time. There's no memorable hits that anyone can reference other than diehard fans. The album got most of it's promo through tours and not radio.

I could not wait for this game to arrive and to my sweet surprise, it came earlier than expected!! I tore open the packaging and started off with Alley Ball aka Skee Ball as some of us know it.  Cute graphics, succinct coordination between the eye, the hand and the TV screen.  I invited my friend over and we played for over 9 hours straight! My only concern is that if I have more than 7 people's profiles created, the game will not allow me to add any additional players.  That may mean people will have to use others' characters or some will have to be erased...we'll see.  I advise anyone with a Wii to get this ASAP, it's a great addition to your Wii system!!I also bought Brunswick Pro Bowl but was highly dissatisfied.  Save your money and spend it on Carnival...you won't be dissapointed!Pros:-Games work very well, seamlessly with the Wii remote.-A huge variety of games from ring toss to dunk tank to darts-Games are not too easy yet not impossible to beat-The desire to unlock the 'super games' keep players wanting more-At first I thought it would be cheesy, but there's great use of prizes system and ticket system, i.e. you can buy items with the tickets you earn-Multi-player mode is fun competition!Cons:-Can't use your already created mii--must choose from set number of characteristics (hair, face, top, pants)-Cannot earn tickets in multi-player mode or in the super unlockable games.-I wish there were even more games but that may just be me being selfish!"

442007,B0057D86QA,Uncomfortable,"This wrist brace is uncomfortable for several reasons. The first reason that was most disappointing is that while the inside of the brace is padded throughout, there is a slit in the padding so that the metal can be removed for washing. The slit is just an unfinished slit cut in the fabric (which is so unlike everything else about the construction of this thing), and it rubs on my skin in a uncomfortable way. My husband tried it on because he thought I was overreacting and even he though it was too annoying to be worn (he's not very sensitive so that's saying a lot). The rest of the issues deal with the brace not really fitting my wrist. Maybe I just have a narrow wrist or something, but when the brace is at rest it is kind of twisted from my hand to mid-arm, and then pokes into my arm at the end. It doesn't really support my wrist at all, as its really loose in that area. Just trying to tighten that portion just tightens the whole thing. So frustrating. I wish I could just find my free hospital-issued wrist brace as it was more functional and east to wear."

1803473,B006YJKAPQ,A must In The tool bag!  Albeit a teeny bit costly!,"The VamPLIERS are without question one of the most versatile pair of pliers in a tool bag.  The tool is very well made, extracts rusty or broken screws swiftly and easily.  By all appearances, this pair of pliers is nothing special.  However, once put to use for its intended purposes, the magic of its cleverly thought-out grooves, reveals itself.  Upon receipt, I was somewhat surprised by its rather modest size. It&#8217;s a small pair of pliers.  Handy for the size of my hands and my usual projects, but, I imagine, therefore also limited to extracting hardware of a particular size or required torque (due to limited leverage.)  The latter is neither an inconvenience nor a drawback in my particular case.  While I recognize that the manufacturer needs to be compensated for development costs, and while taking into consideration that the tool seems neatly and solidly fabricated, the pair of pliers is a bit on the costly side.  The 1 star reduction solely due to the price factor."

2747480,B00065HKKW,prequels are absolutely worthless,"Both of these prequels are absolutely worthless pictures, they detract from the brilliance and realism of the first film, which is a superb endeavor. They suffer from an inability to commit to serious script writing, story and funding, what they have created instead is an extremely &#34;dumb downed&#34; version that should have never been made at all. It is obvious they were made for the &#34;MTV generation&#34;, as they do not notice the subtle errors which have been egregiously made. Sub-par acting dominates each of them, stilted corny dialogue, written by the inept writer for the masses, Caleb Carr, douses any suspense at all. The film stock also detracts, as it appears that reality is only an imitation, take for example some shots of a cave, they appear to be well lit and inside a fake set, the church itself resembles a piece of plastic, the statues are styrofoam, and the CGI is offensive to the eye.The original was actually filmed in Syria in historic ruins, which added to the mystery, you will also notice that nothing is really &#34;believable&#34; such as what you found in the films from the 1970's, the faces of actors are clean or have some fake blood or dirt smeared on them and the lighting is too bright. The costuming is even worse, and black workers speaking on equal terms to the whites is only rewriting history to explain the storyline to dumb audiences. Plainly, these are some of the worse films that I have ever been forced to see, they should only be watched for their assumptions about how greed has permeated the film industry."

3658418,B001BOVEU4,My cats favorite toy,"I have two cats, one is about 1.5 years old and the other is 4 months old. The older one is less playful than he was as a kitten, but as a kitten this was his favorite toy by far. My 4 month old absolutely LOVES this toy. When he sees me reach for it (I have to hide it otherwise he'll tear it apart) you can see how excited he gets. I've tried all the attachments and the feather is the best as well. I've since purchased about 5 of these wands because I lost two to hurricane sandy and I like to have multiple wands with different attachments so that I can vary the attachment without having to keep removing them and the cat can keep playing with different stimulations. I absolutely love this and it's a pleasure to see my kitten hunt it. When the feathers get destroyed I just take them off the wand and use them as stand alone toys which my cat bats around and plays with on his own. The refills are relatively expensive, but the amount of fun we have with this toy compensates for the cost."

3745095,B0009JKGJW,Smoother running engine,"Run this in a daily driver to make it last longer (I use 8 or even 10-12 oz in my 2005 Lincoln Town Car at each fill-up) and overall smoother engine response.Run it in an older car or dirtier engine to clean out a lot of old deposits (the bad deposits, not the varnish that HELPS lubricatethe engine).  Might see a small increase in MPG in that scenario.Here's a helpful tip: as the instructions indicate, you may replace up to 20% of your motor oil with this.I ran a quart of it in the Lincoln with new (but cheap) 5W-20 motor oil and a cheap filter (the Fram Orange Can of Death ExtraGuard isfine for this purpose) for 2 weeks and then changed the oil & filter back to the really good Motorcraft FL-820S and synthetic oilI normally used.  I say that's just as useful as a SeaFoam treatment or any of the so-called engine""flush"" treatments, whichmost cars don't need unless they've been mistreated for years.  Worked well in my car which as as smooth-running as one couldhope for at about 114,000 miles and 8 years old.  Look inside under the oil fill cap and everything shines nicely.And as always use 4 oz per 10 gallons (or so, I actually use a bit more but that's just me talking) in the fuel at every fill up -- addit BEFORE filling up for best possible mixing.  But after is all right as well, better then than never."
1302774,B005AGGZ8K,I would pass.,"I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap, but I don't know why. Maybe other people don't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before. It wasn't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds, but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd. It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters. I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap. Unless you're just going for something that is inexpensive, does the job, and isn't designed for comfort."
2620987,B000087F5T,"I love this show, but the DVD is not worth the money","Insomniac is one of my favorite TV shows. I love watching each week as Dave tours city after city in his own twisted alchoholic comedian type persona. If I visited these towns, these are the places I would go. It's a great idea and a great show.But this DVD gives us nothing new. No new footage at all, just the original shows uncensored. We get to hear the bleeped cussing and we get to see a little nudity. But, like another reviewer said, the show really isn't about that, and honestly, the nudity we do get to see is not really worth seeing (Okay, the chick in Montreal is nice, but otherwise it's nothing exciting).I was really hoping for some behind the scenes stuff. Maybe bloopers, out takes, and deleted scenes, or stuff so shocking or sexy it had to be cut out all together on the TV edition. I was hoping to see Brian the cameraman. All you get on this DVD is the exact same show you saw on TV without the Bleeps and the Blurs.And who picked these cities as the best of season one anyway? The New York episode on this DVD is from season 2, and it is the worst of the three times Dave has done New York. The two New York episodes that really were in Season one were both great, and where is Memphis. That was the best epsiode from season one, hands down!Anyway, love the show, love Dave Attell, totally dissapointed in the DVD."

Dante fixed that for home video.  There are even a couple of cut scenes added as an additional special feature."

120792,B009A51Y10,Just Aweful,"First off, you only get one and one chance to get it right. I've had enough phones and other electronics like digital cameras that i've used screen protectors for so I have experience applying them.Second, there are no tabs that say part one peel first etc.Third, when you start applying it, you get rainbow streaks that after lifting back up to try and try and try again you get lines in it that don't go away.The application is one of the most terrible out of so many other screen protectors i've tried. The streaks have a rainbow effect and no matter how you slowly place it and try to rub them out with the enclosed microfiber cloth, they don't come out. Luckily, I had ordered Tech Armor Apple New iPhone 5 High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3-Pack) [AT&T;, Verizon. Sprint, International and Unlocked iPhone 5 Models] which worked on the first try and....you get 3 just incase you mess one up and or need to change it out at a later time.The best time to apply these things is when you first get the phone and take it out of the box this way there will be next to no dust, lint or finger/face grease.3m Is usually a great product but not this time, the application was just awful and didn't work."
1866224,B0000UJLJG,Best of 2003 from the 3 Kings (4 stars),"Westside Connection came back stronger than ever w/ their `Terrorist Threats"" album, makin' all their fans embrace their music after close to 8 years. ""Call 9-1-1"" sets the album off right w/ a bangin' beat by Young T.R.E., followed by the face-paced ""Potential Victims"" and the hit ""Gangsta Nation"" w/ Nate Dogg. WsC shows how they are one of the best groups around, and why their music is still revelant today. ""Pimp the System"" w/ Butch Cassidy, ""So Many Rappers in Love"", and ""You Gotta Have Heart"" are also standout tracks on this album. Check out `Terrorist Threats' right now, cause it my not be for ANOTHER 8 years until Westside Connection comes out w/ another album. And if that does happen, expect the same from Cube, Mack 10, & WC-bangin' beats and hard rhymes.Oh, by the way, to that latest 'kid review', you probably have Chingy/J-Kwon/Bow Bow posters up in your room, so since you don't know what real music is anyway, shut the f**k up and start ""hood hoppin"" or ""powerballin"""

1429559,B00269QLJ2,Worst PC purchase I've ever made,Pros: Good graphicsCons: Every possible thing you can think of that is not graphic related. Single player is short and a joke. It takes less than 5 hours of total game play on the hardest difficulty. There is no replay value like the first Modern Warfare provided. The online play is an absolute disaster. Every single online match is rampant with cheaters and connection problems. There is nothing you can do about a cheater. You can't ban cheaters or remove them from a game. If you are not the host of the game you can expect serious lag.If I had purchased anything else for $60 and it performed like this product I would have received a full refund.

1796844,B005DKJIVE,"Watch, I am disappoint","*** This is the review I was going to write ***I was a little skeptical when I was offered this watch. It claimed you could take your pulse in 10 seconds, just by pressing two fingers against your wrist. OK, but you can do that with any watch in 15 seconds, just by multiplying by four. After playing with it for a while, however, I grew to appreciate it:Pros:- Shows you your pulse rate while you're exercising, without a band around your chest like the more expensive pulse watches.- It also has regular watch functions like time, date, alarm.- It has a nice stopwatch function.Cons:- You can't be running or moving jerkily while taking the pulse (though walking is ok)- Slightly dextro-centric. While it's possible to get the watch to work on the right wrist, it was clearly designed for use on the left.- Poor use of real estate. The two sensors to press your fingers on are above and below the watch face (at about 1 and 7 o'clock). This means that there can't be buttons there, or at 6 and 12, which is the easiest place to reach for things like the stopwatch and light. Furthermore, the button at 10 o'clock is only used for decrementing a value when setting the watch. This button is in a prime location, and would be much easier to press than the current light or stopwatch buttons, which are at 3 and 2 o'clock, respectively.- Shweddy wrist. The watch band is plastic, with no perforations except to accommodate the buckle. My wrist was dripping ten minutes into my workout. And, since the pulse monitor needs to have contact with your wrist, you can't wear a sweatband underneath.- The calorie counter is a nice motivation, but I'm very skeptical that you can figure out kcal burned by only looking at pulse rate and weight.*** The review I'm actually writing ***I had great fun playing with the watch when it first arrived - taking my pulse while walking around the house, holding my breath to see if it would change, and so on. The next day, I decided to take it on the road.While sitting calmly on the morning train, I was a little surprised to find my pulse was 105, but the ride wasn't that smooth, so I gave the watch a pass. After a brisk five blocks, I stopped to wait for a walk signal, and found my pulse was 175. Skepticism increased. Sitting in my dentist waiting room I got clocked at 109, which was alarming enough that I took my pulse the old-fashioned way. 85. After a few minutes of nitrous the watch went down to 90, and my own count went to 75. At lunch later in the day the watch claimed I was up to 113, with no evidence of tachycardia from taking my pulse manually. And so on. I can take a hint - I have a defective watch.Amazon is great about returns. But this also seemed like a good chance to review Omron's customer service. So I called the number on the operating instructions that came with the watch, and had a nice chat with their representative, who instructed me to send the watch back, at my own expense, along with an $8 check or money order to cover return shipping. When I explained that I had only gotten the watch the previous day, she explained that they would replace the watch if their ""inspection"" showed that it was in fact defective, but that the company doesn't cover shipping, in either direction, even if the watch is defective. Oh, and they suggest you get shipping insurance, since they don't cover that either.Amazon is great with customer service. Omron is not, even when they ship a defective product. This is my review."

Well, this was their answer; a half rap and half rock album.Muggs also experiments on the rap side and the result is, well boring.  The rock side might attract new fans to the Hill, but for anyone who doesn't like rock music...this is only a waste of 6 tracks.So if you like rap/rock combos, this might be for you.

The movie was so flawed it made me sick.  How bad can one person screw up our nations history.  Um, well, according to this movie.  REALLY BADLY!  Half the main characters were not that way in history, and Day-Lewis' character was a composite of 3 people over a 50 year span of history.Not to mention for all you conservative and well mannered people the idea of ""violence is okay because our country was founded on it"" may really rest uneasy for you.

Most times, I'll see a movie and think either that I'd watch it again or I wouldn't, but I still enjoy it more or less either way. This movie, though, is an exception. To put it as bluntly as I can, it is simply the most God-awful piece of trash I have ever seen in my entire life. It's definately one of the three or four movies I've ever seen that I would consider actively bad.First of all, it's boring. The movie drags on for hours and nothing particularly interesting happens. I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly interesting or sympathetic. They all just seemed flat and emotionless to me. About the scene where Achilles killed Hector, I was so bored I wanted to leave the theater, and would have if I hadn't been with other people. How they can turn one of the classics of western literature into a bloated sleeper is beyond me. That has to take real talent.Secondly, the action is bad. Okay, so the whole Achilles taking the guy out with one hit was really cool the first time they showed it, but after a while it just got really annoying. Kind of like the ""bullet-time"" thing in the Matrix; really cool the first few times you see it, but it loses something with over-use. The battle sequences themselves are confusing, largely because it's very difficult to tell the Trojans from the Greeks. The battles also feel kind like a poor cross between Lord of the Rings and Gladiator, and it seems like this movie is just trying to ride their success and popularity. The only thing is, the director here obviously doesn't have the eye for this kind of thing the directors of those films did.The story. This movie is supposed to be based on the Iliad. It even says it is in the credits, but the story has absolutely no resembelence to the original in any way. It takes place at the same location, with most of the same characters, and there's still the Trojan horse (with everything else they changed, I'm surprised they left this in). But everything else is different. The Greek gods not only figure into the original story, but are essential to it. There basically is no story without them, giving you this confused movie. The ten year siege is reduced to the period of about ten days or a week, making much of it not make sense (I guess the screen writers don't understand the concept of a SIEGE, which isn't a battle, but an attempt to starve out an enemy stronghold and force them to surrender.). Also, what's the deal with Patroclus being Achilles' cousin? They're not cousins in the original. Just kinda bugs me. The changes in general wouldn't bother me too much, except that the movie almost seems to be mocking the original at times, such as when the characters are made to look foolish for having faith in the gods, etc. Also, I have to say that I did not need to see that much of Brad Pitt.There are a couple good points about the movie. Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean are very good as Priam and Oddyseus, respectively (although I prefer Armande Asante as Oddyseus in NBC's production of The Oddysey a few years ago), and there are a few times when the movie ties into the mythology. When Paris kills Achilles and shoots him in the heel, that was a nice touch, since in the poem, that was his one vulnerable spot. I also liked the end when Paris gave his sword to Aeneus(sp?) and tells him to lead the survivors away. This is a reference to Virgil's The Aeneid, essentially the Roman version of the story in which Virgil claims the Romans are decended from Aeneus and the Trojan refugees. However, these references to the mythology only make the parts where it is left out or seemingly disparaged all the more baffling and annoying. It's like the people making the film couldn't decide how far they wanted to deviate from the original.If you're interested in the kind of movie, I'd suggest getting Gladiator, or even the old NBC version of the Oddysey, both of which are far superior and much more entertaining than this mess."

The stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing. The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. The holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height. They looked like they might be relatively solid but I returned them anyway...bit disappointing."

2119253,6300268918,A Mad Masterpiece.,"Filmmaker Ken Russell pulls no punches in this blistering film based on real events that took place in the town of Loudun in the 1600s.  Oliver Reed is almost a force of nature in his performance as Father Urbain Grandier, a flawed man of the cloth who is both filled with a worldly lust for power and the pleasures of the flesh, and finally able to see the error of his ways and truly repent.  The performance is electric, almost jumping off the screen.  You really see the evolution of the man from arrogant womanizer to penitent victim of a conspiracy between the church and the state and finally to martyr.  Grandier's popularity and the power that the now deceased Govenor of Loudun bestowed on him makes him a target of those who are conspiring to tear down Loudun's fortifications, and to rid themselves of this willful thorn in their sides. When Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave), the Mother Superior of the Ursuline nuns who is secrectly attracted to Grandier, begins accusing him of bewitching her and her fellow nuns, a claim that was false, Grandier's enemies have the excuse they need to destroy him.  With the arrival of the exorcist Father Barre (Michael Gothard), chaos erupts in the city as public exorcisms - actually nothing more than debauched and blasphemus orgies - ensue, much to the delight of the public, who have had their sensibilities dulled by the ravages of the Black Death.  Russell does not so much push the envelope with these scenes as rip the envelope to shreds and burn it to ashes.  However, it should be noted that his intention here is not to support the behavior of the hysterical nuns and their debauched exorcists, but to show just how fully religion can be corrupted.  Contrast is given in Grandier's dawning realization of his own shortcomings.  Through this ordeal, he finally finds peace with himself and with his God, something that eludes his accusers.  The film has been subjected to much censorship over the years.  One scene in particular is still missing, the so-called ""Rape of Christ"" sequence where the nuns tear down a large statue of Christ and defile it.  This scene was intercut with a scene of Grandier conducting a mass, further illustrating the difference between a flawed man who can acknowledge his mistakes, and people who use religion as a means to a selfish end.  Grandier's torture has also been heavily censored, so we are only shown bits of his legs being crushed, but you get the idea.  Found guilty and sentenced to be burned alive, the now crippled Grandier is dragged through the streets much to the delight of the very people who loved him not so very long ago.  His execution is treated like a circus, with people laughing and cheering as the innocent Grandier is slowly immolated, all the while imploring the people of Loudun to stand up to those who would enslave them.  This is a very powerful film, one that deserves to be seen in its uncut form.  Until then, we have this version, which is the British X version.  See this film.  It is a mad masterpiece that deserves to be seen."

1310400,B00002STYR,No other fighter comes close.,"First of all, I mean no other fighting game matches this one in replay value, due to insane combos (of which there are many different variations), great &quot;No Mercy&quot; (finishing) moves and a great cast of characters. I was a fan from the moment I played it for the first time, and 10 years later it is still without a doubt my favorite game of all-time. Do not be mistaken though, I am not saying all of the other fighters out there are bad(Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat are also 5 star fighters), but when Killer Instinct hit the arcades there was nothing like it, at least in my opinion. The graphics were beautiful, the combos were amazing and it seemed like an all around original game.Other reviewers might have you believe this game rips off the others, but nothing could be further from the truth. Sure, they all share similarities, but Killer Instinct was the first to develop this complex combo system, consisting of linkers, auto-doubles and enders, not to mention the ULTRA combo. To me the ULTRA is the greatest concept of all-time as far as fighting games are concerned. It is a move performed at the end of a combo that adds many more hits to give a great-looking combo to finish off your opponent. There are also combo breakers to stop your opponent from performing a combo on you. So by now you should be able to understand that this game takes a LOT of practice to get good at. Learning the combo theory, mastering each character's moves and getting comfortable with each character's style is hard work, but with enough practice will be rewarding once you know your stuff. There are 8 great characters to choose from, each with their own background level, and depending on the location you can knock your opponent off of buildings. It has pretty decent music to boot, giving a great game experience--in my opinion one of the best games you could own for the Super NES. So if you are a fan of fighting games or own a Super NES, try this one out. You can find it for very cheap these days, so it is definately worth picking up if you see it around. You will either hate this game and never want to play it again, or you will be hooked instantly and develop an addiction to the style this game presents."

There are about 15 bears in each bag, red, orange and yellow. I liked the yellow ones best.When they arrived I was eager to get into the bag to taste, so I tried to open it by pulling on the sides to open in the top. This was not very successful! I eventually noticed the slit at the top, which facilitates opening by pulling it open on the side.I am giving this 4 stars because I had a problem stopping eating these, and as a result I got a nasty sugar head ache and an icky feeling in my tummy.

It might've been funny if it didn't try so hard to be tragic.When I first saw the Lion in Winter in Western Civ class, I thought it was the worst movie I'd ever seen. The rest of the class seemed to be in agreement. After a second viewing, I offer a full retraction. The story is actually very good, as are most of the performances. Unfortunately the film lacks the focus to be effective. While most of the actors did a good job in his or her own right, the chemistry between characters is on the level of a middle school production of Shakespeare.Some of the scenes have a Python-esque charm to them, but the direction doesn't compliment it. And it shouldn't. It's not meant to be a spoof, but the more serious scenes lack the intensity of anything better. One of the biggest problems with the film is that it provides no emotional anchor with which the viewer can sympathize. It also sidesteps the personal conflicts in favor of portraying stategy. The result is like watching complete strangers playing chess. Today I also viewed Bergman's The Seventh Seal for the first time, a movie about a knight who plays chess with Death. It far surpasses this film in every way, shape, and form.If those who made The Lion in Winter understood the material to the degree that Bergman did, this could've been a great film. As is, it is a valiant attempt but an ultimate failure."

Sometimes the mic on the J3M's gets turned or rubs against my clothes when I'm sitting, so it isn't completely perfect.So I took a chance on the Cellet headset and I'm very pleasantly surprised.  The sound in the earpiece isn't near as good as the J3M, but this headset is unabashedly designed for phone calls and only needs to pass voice frequencies as opposed to the JLab J3M or any other headset of theirs which are music headsets first and have incredible sound quality.  Voice on this headset sounds great, so it does what it's supposed to.The real test for any mic'd headset, corded or Bluetooth, is how the audio going OUT sounds. Many inexpensive, and most expensive headsets have awful output.  I tested this item on an iPhone 5 and LG Optimus G Pro and found it to sound every bit as good as the phones' built in mics.  No distortion, same volume output, and clear as one can get on a cellular connection.This item is great, the price is definitely right, and while I'll only use it in the office as my JLab items are my headsets for music, I highly recommend this item for making calls."

1719437,B000BD8NTQ,junk put your reciept underneeth the unit. so that you can return it under warrantee,I bought a pair of these at my local home center as a part of a house remodeling project.  One of them lasted 9 months.  then it began beeping every 30 seconds or minute.  Steady beeping. not stoppable by replacing the battery or blowing it out.  or disconnecting it then holding down the button without a battery in it until it &#34;Forgot&#34; its problem.  Sadly since they have a special interconnecting wiring harness you have to buy a replacement of the same brand or bring your electrician back to replace both of them.

The only drawback that I can see, and I don't really even consider this a negative, is the coiled cord. Some people may not like that. All in all these are great headphones - I have listened to all varieties of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc... excellent! By the way, they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background, making the music come out clearer.

Mine: ""Watery tarts handing out swords is no basis for a system of government.""I only wish that they had restored the film for this supposedly deluxe special edition. The picture is still as washed out and grainy as I remember it from the late-late show."

3179176,B002VECMAE,Strained Psychic Satire,"""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" was disappointing because I expected more outright laughs.  The premise of psychics fighting in the military sounded funny and inviting, but delivered a loud ""thud"" in interest with the barely followable surrealistic schemes.  Ewan McGregor plays journalist/reporter Bob Wilton who becomes involved and fascinated by a unbelievable story of the military using psychics to fight the enemy in Iraq.  He meets Lynn Cassady (George Clooney) who is going to the Iraq battlefront.  Lynn claims to be a Jedi fighter (warrior monk) and sees something in Bob that connects.  They both leave the safe zone and go out to confront the enemy using psychic powers.  Bob also wants to write a groundbreaking scoop of a story.Jeff Bridges plays the military trainer of the Jedi's - he is a former hippie flower child who works with the Army to develop ""Jedi-Students"" innate psychic powers.  There is a fine cast in this movie (Kevin Spacey and Rebecca Mader co-star), but the jokes fail and the slapstick is scattered.Overall the satire of American foreign policy was strained."

1472194,B0047SIUZI,Not as overhyped as first thought,"When I first started playing the different games in Bejeweled 3, I thought that it was nice, but hardly worth the ecstatic praise heaped on it by almost everyone.  The ""Lightning"" game seemed to have too many cascades.  The first level of ""Quests"" were easily passed and didn't seem that novel.  Silly me.  I forgot that not everyone has been playing Bejeweled for, well for a long time, and so neophytes would need ""tutorial"" levels.  So the second time I pulled it up on the computer I dived in farther and the fun started.  Its challenging.  Its novel. Its a definite ""next step"" in the Bejeweled family.  The only reason I didn't give it an overall 5 star rating, was that the ""Zen"" area and I weren't made for each other.  Its a personal thing.  Great idea, just not for everyone.  Still Bejeweled 3 is worth the $20 for novices and professionals alike.  Buy it.  Get addicted all over again.  Now if you'll excuse me, I need to reach 500K in ""Lightning."""

It does take at least 45 minutes to an hour to totally numb the area, and I did have to use quite a bit but that might be because I am a total wimp. When waxing or using an epilator you will need to wipe the cream off as it leaves a residue but don't worry, the area will stay numb for about 10 minutes after re,icing the cream. If you are going to a salon to be waxed just take a facial cleansing cloth or wet wipe to get it off"

1390534,B000R0SS3Y,Fun game in terrible package,"Too Human is the new Diablo clone on the X360. It is a fun game but be prepared to wade through a lot of messy, poorly programmed mistakes to get to it.Here's a hint to other developers: If you have mutiple dialogue languages options in your game, and then list that the game has subtitles, you should probably ACTUALLY have subtitles all the way through, at least for the cutscenes. Not just for 1 in 6. Also, 30 second death animations went out of style before we even knew what death animations were. ALSO also, over the top, gung ho manly men were only ever done correctly in Aliens. For crying out loud, STOP TRYING TO DO IT. They come off as idiotic, immature losers. I suppose much the same as the audience they're aimed at but for crying out loud lets try leading by example instead. Also, tutorial messages should stay on the screen until I choose to make them go away, NOT after 3 seconds. Especially when they're long enough to take up half the screen.Also, also, also terrible writing. ""Permission to kick ass, sir"" is not a dialogue line I should ever have to hear, much less every 2 minutes.Also x 4, If you're making a god? Like in this game? Baldur? Don't make him look like a overweight gym teacher that never married. And moral raising speeches do not need to be as long as they are nor as lame and stupid sounding.Silicon Knights, you people have NO TALENT.They literally rip of every ""cool masculine"" genre convention out there, from the opening of Diablo II, to Aliens to even using bullet time from The Matrix. Yeah, bullet time. That thing everyone is sick of. Even worse, EVERY WOMAN IN THE GAME makes it VERY obvious that they think Baldur is just the hottest meat on the hoof. Mayby SK needs to hire some people who are actually attracted to men because this fellow they've made? This Baldur? Not only is he ugly but he's chubby too. In fact, the woman are portrayed so offensively that I just have to shake my head and stare; several characters even go into tirades about how woman have no place on the battle field and all they're good for is sex and magic.AND NO ONE EVER DISAGREES WITH THEM, EVEN THE WOMEN WHO ARE PRESENT.Also (again), every character has these ""idle animations"" they do when you aren't controlling them. They obviously have ants in their chocolate mines because they do them instantly and constantly. And you know what they are? Professional wrestling streches. It just looks so stupid I can't believe it. That's what this storyline is, Norse gods replaced with cybernetic professional wrestlers.Again, tho, the game itself is great fun. Half the time I'm enjoying the gameplay, which is new and tricky, and half the time I'm scrambling for the mute button and hammering the skip cutscene button (which doesn't work all the time either)."
3091612,B001J710XO,What you'd expect,"This wasn't nearly as horrible as some make it out to be. Was it great? Of course not. It's what you would expect of this type of those ""another teen movie"" kind of thing. The main theme of the movie is a parody of Cloverfield, although no dino's are ever seen. The main group of losers at first try and get out of the city and run into all kinds of the worst of the most recent pop culture sort of things, i.e. Hannah Montannah, Sex and the City girls...etc. Then they get the call that the lead character's girlfriend is stuck at a museum and so they head back to rescue her. The movie starts out fairly bad. But if you can hang on until the Enchanted Princess shows up things get noticeably funnier. I can't imagine anybody actually purchasing this on DVD, even when it's only $4 in a bargain bin. But it's worth at least a cheap red box $1 rental to see it. It's almost worth a $1 just to see the final scene (The I'm dating somebody else song). I thought that was, for better or worse, by far the funniest part of the movie. Like I said, it isn't horrible...and it certainly isn't for kids. But I imagine there's a bunch of gen x'ers that will find it mildly amusing and a whole bunch of gen y'ers who will laugh their behinds off, but that's mainly cause their standard of funny is a lot different than mine! :) It's definitely a 1.5 star movie, not bad enough to be one star, but 2 stars is being extremely generous."

I'll try some WD-40 to get the annoying residue off but for crying out loud, can't anyone come up with a sticker that is removable without a headache? And as an end user, a UPC sticker serves nobody.

That way you can get more total light production out of the same light fixture, and you can spread the light around a bit more because the two bulbs will point in slightly different directions.You still have to be careful not to exceed the total rated maximum for the light fixture, of course. Light is nice to have, but not in the form of fire.Like most products from Leviton, which is the leading manufacturer of outlets and light switches and the like in the US, this one is simple and sturdy.

3761129,B00ATXEIVU,Form Follows Function -  4 USB + 1 AC Outlet Cup Holder Car Charger,"This thing is really cool.  It's a sleek car charger that fits into any standard car cup holder.  The cord isn't super long, so your cup holder ideally needs to be fairly close to your car's accessory port (or cigarette lighter, as they used to be called.)CompactThis thing is about the size of an 8oz cup.  It's kind of stout, like the beverage cups they usually give on airlines, so it doesn't take up much room or add clutter.4 Convenient USB Ports - Enough to ShareThese days, we all have multiple devices that need to be charged.  And since USB is becoming the standard, the 4 USB ports on this charger can juice up most anything with a USB cable.  And there's enough ports to go around, so whoever's riding shotgun can plug in their devices too!BONUS -- AC Plug Power Inverter too!This cool little thing even has a 3-prong AC power inverter, so you can plug in virtually anything with a standard AC cord and use it in your car -- laptop, tablet, emergency light, beverage cooler, hotplate (LOL) -- virtually anything with a standard wall plug!  I have many extra gadgets, so the bonus AC outlet has proven to be very handy and convenient.Bottom Line - really love this cup holder car charger. Offers a lot of bang for the buck and all packed into a very compact and well made gadget. Love it!  Happy! ;oD"
1562886,B000LKTY7Y,Read the ingredients!,"I think the ratings for Mori-Nu Tofu would not be so high if more people were actually aware of what's in it. Mori-Nu's tofu contains soy protein isolate, a highly processed form of soy. As a busy student cooking for myself most nights, I'm always looking for grocery products that will make putting dinner on the table more convenient. But while I was intrigued by the shelf-stability of Mori-Nu Tofu, I'm definitely not counting on it as a staple-- Tofu is considered healthy because it is a fermented soy product, but the soy protein isolate in Mori-Nu's tofu puts it in the category of processed soy, the kind that will mess with your endocrine system if consumed it regularly. This means if you're eating tofu for the health benefits, you may as well look elsewhere. What I've learned is that most tofus packed in water have expiry dates two months ahead (unopened) so you'll only need to replenish your supply every 1 1/2-2 months. Sure, this would save me space in the fridge and I could stock up on a year's worth of tofu if I really wanted to (and I might want to, but a year's worth of tofu is hardly a necessity). But the bottom line is I'm just unwilling to make this highly processed food a staple, particularly when versions that are truly healthy are readily available."

His Jigsaw character has brought new life into the Horror genre and this installment has it all. Loose ends are tied up, new questions are tossed at us, we find out even more about Jigsaw's past, and there is action, thrills, and gore galore. Saw's mixture of terror, CSI style detective drama, and action is very addictive. Tobin Bell holds it all together though. This man is a great actor and a modern day Vincent Price in my opinion. Check him out in Boogeyman 2 and Buried Alive also."

1441108,B002I0H2G0,My favorite of 2012,"Not really much to say but awesome. I understand that they kind of broke out of the designs from previous Hitmans so I understand the anger and for a small period I was angry too. But truth is, after finishing Absolution I bought Hitman Trilogy and couldn't play any of those games. The mechanics of Absolution is wayyy beyond what the old Hitmans were. What Absolution lacks is the open world feel of the old Hitmans. In the old Hitmans, you had a target and a small open-world level and mission was to kill target. Absolution follows a story line, so sometimes you are sneaking your way through a somewhat directed level (i.e. you have to go through point A and point B to get to C), sometimes you are running away from certain people, and finally the best moments are when you have targets to kill. For the first two is where criticism sinks comes in but if the mission is to kill targets...boy... there's no other game like it. You'll always have multiple ways to kill your targets and there'll be plenty of opportunities as well. The most fun to kill your targets is to do as the game encourages you to do, to kill your target and leave the scene undetected with no additional casualties. Finding the way to do this makes you feel accomplished if you succeed.As far as storyline goes, it is decent enough and it'll make you interested to follow but characters are pretty one dimensional and overall the story doesn't take you anywhere special. Graphics are pretty darn good if not some of the best out there. I played this on a PS3 and frame rate was solid 90-95% of the time. So yeah, overall it's a fantastic game and my personal favorite of 2012. There are obvious room for improvements but when the game shines, it's beyond fantastic."

The Aqueon is back on the tank--inaudible by comparison."
1413677,B001B1W3GG,Bioshock Review,"Bioshock is incredible. It was the first game I ever fired up on my shiny new PS3, and I was simply mind-blown. The opening act is one of the most intense, exciting, awe-inspiring, and terrifying experiences I have ever had in a game. And the intensity never lets up - from your first encounter with a Big Daddy to the amazing conclusion, as you play through the game the mysteries of the underwater city of Rapture begin to unravel with incredible twists and turns.What makes Bioshock so outstanding is that it aspires to be more than just another shooter with a generic storyline that serves simply as an excuse for the gameplay. In Bioshock, the gameplay feels incidental to the story, which I find extremely refreshing. The game is all about exploring the city and confronting the many ethical, sociological, and psychological issues raised by many of the characters and the idea of the city of Rapture itself. Evidences of the ideals that formed the basis for the creation of Rapture by founder Andrew Ryan are found everywhere in the city. Signs, banners, advertisements, scrawled messages in blood, public service announcements...everywhere you turn there is something to examine or read that adds to your understanding of the city, and the deeper issues involved. The first banner you see, in that great opening act, reads: ""No Gods. No Kings. Only Man."" This is the mantra of Andrew Ryan, and his vision for the city of Rapture. Allow Ryan to explain in more detail:""I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'it belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'it belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'it belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture, a city where the artist would not fear the censor, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality, Where the great would not be constrained by the small! And with the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well.""The implications of such a city are certainly frightening, and Bioshock forces you to confront many of those implications. Little Sisters present the most direct confrontation with these implications, as you have to choose to harvest them (giving yourself a better chance of surviving the horrors of the broken city, but killing the Little Sisters in the process), or to rescue them (leaving yourself less powerful but allowing the Litter Sisters to survive). Many of the other issues in Bioshock, along with the Little Sister dilemma, are confronted in the players mind, long after the game has been saved and the console shut down.The presentation and visuals are beautiful (and often disturbing) and strongly immerse the player in the dark, flickering halls of Rapture. The shooting gameplay is very fun, especially with the refreshing strategy and style of play that comes with using plasmids (the special powers your character uses through genetic modification). The story is very well written and dives into very deep issues, many of which are terrifying and difficult to confront - fitting for a game set so deep beneath the ocean surface. I also admire that the story is told without dependence on cutscenes; instead it is told through the information you obtain from your exploration of the city. An amazing game. Now...would you kindly play it?""We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us."""

At the auto parts store I was quoted $100-$150, which seemed kind of steep until they told me that price was EACH!Being a cheap SOB I wasn't paying that for something I didn't NEED.  Then the other day while looking for license plate light bulbs I stumbled across these fog lights for $40 each.  Much better!  So I ordered them, but I worried that they would be poorly made etc.First off, that troublesome lens.  The new foglight lenses are marked as DOT approved and the new design incorproates a tab on either side that mechanically holds the lens in place along with the adhesive bond. Not an equal design, it's BETTER than OEM.  the molding of the housing looks identical in material, weight, and shape.  Perfect!  Just because I'm nuts like this I added a bit of &#34;shoe goo&#34; around the lens as a bit of extra insurance against lost lenses.The lights came securely packaged but it was all easy to open.  the lenses had a protective sheet on them that can be removed after installation to protect from scratches.  Shipping was fast."

525749,B00FWM09CA,Low cost for a ton of bandages,"This is exactly what it looks like: a giant box of bandages. They come in various sizes and can be used for different cuts or scrapes depending on your needs. Like another reviewer, I found the adhesive to not be stellar on mine, but good enough. As an example, I had a cut on my toe and I put one of the appropriately-sized bandages on it. It already started peeling as I put my sock on, and it pretty much came off during the day just from casual walking around in my office. However, this could because of the location of the bandage; areas that experience less regular friction may work better. My wife seems to have had better success with keeping the bandages on. One thing that I would have liked would be if these were organized a bit better, as when you open the box it is just a big jumble of bandages and you have to poke through looking for what you want (if it's not one of the higher-quantity ones)."

1500205,B006JKASCK,It's a ripoff,"100 bucks for 32 gig or memory. Yep, that's right. Sony was too stupid to figure out a way to make money off the Vita hardware, so they removed the built-in memory they had once planned for it (for game saves) and forced gamers to buy additional proprietary memory just to play games. Yes, the majority of games on the Vita will not ever start if you don't have a memory card installed in it. It's almost as if Sony enjoys being the worst gaming company. Know what else your money gets you with these overpriced memory sticks? Slow transfer speeds. Yep, the memory cards are 3-5 seconds slower when playing a game like Uncharted download from PSN than if you had bought the game retail. So in other words Sony's claim that they went with proprietary expensive media was to ensure fast transfer speeds is garbage. Go buy a 3DS (actually dont. That things a piece of ****) or an iPad."
1445139,B002I0JBL4,Let down to the original...,"Let's face it - this game has been hyped for a long, long time - so it did start out with some pretty big shoes to fill.  It fails miserably in my opinion.I was a huge Duke Nukem fan back in college when it first came out.  My friends and I spent hours in front of our old 486 laughing our heads off at the over the top violence, crazy one liners and overall entertainment.  You never knew what was next - there was just nothing like it before.Fast forward to this new one - it opens with you having to bumble around a building attempting to get to a tv studio.  This is your first taste of how terrible the graphics are - the characters you bump into have no life to them and the graphics are good by 1st generation xbox or playstation 2 standards.  Seems the started the game for those previous gen systems and never bothered to sharpen them up.Within a few minutes, you'll be able to walk into a bathroom, open a stall door, and pick up/throw feces.  It just felt like the creators of the game knew Duke Nukem needed shock value - heck the original was full of it.  But the game forces it - its like it can't quite be funny or shocking, so it just tries to make you think it is funny or shocking.  It loses the lighthearted feel of the first, and just comes across as a pathetic attempt to get cheap laughs.Shortly after, you get to fight a pretty huge guy in a football field and punt his head through the goal posts when you beat him.  Sounds like a great setup, but by that point, I was so bored I barely cracked a smile.  The boss fight itself showed just how inaccurate the aiming system is - I found it very jerky, and very difficult to aim exactly where you want.  On the PS3, it doesn't even close to the precise movements that a mouse would give you on a PC, or that the XBox 360 controller would give you on Halo or Call of Duty.I read a lot of reviews saying this was a disappointment so I bought it used from Gamefly for $8.99.  For that price - its fun for a little nostalgia, but will quickly gather dust on your shelf."

3754503,B0028081GK,Perfect for Changing Tires,"This is an excellent, easy to use torque wrench. The instruction sheet included in the protective heavy duty plastic box is simple to follow. With alloy wheels and light weight disc brake hubs, getting the torque correct when changing tires is critical. Too much force on those lug nuts and the studs can break off, too little force and the wheel can wobble, uneven force and the brake rotor can warp. It is an important job to do right.The wrench has a reversible ratchet with a half inch drive. The box includes a half inch to three eights drive adapter, and a half inch extension. While tightening a bolt, when the proper torque is reached the wrench gives off a reasonably loud click and definite feedback in the handle (sound and feel that the torque setting was reached). Presetting the torque is fairly easy by loosing the lock nut and twisting the handle until the desired torque lines up with the center line. The only tricky part is a half turn is 10 foot pounds. Odd number tens are on the left and even numbers are on the right. Increments of 2 are marked on the handle for really precise torque. Once the torque is set, turn the nut on the end to lock the setting.This wrench looks to be really rugged. I expect it will last a long time. Like any other precision instrument (I know it sounds weird that a wrench is a precision instrument) dropping it isn't a good idea. Store it in the plastic case and it will give years of service.How long do I keep my tools? A very long time. I finally decided to replace my ancient antique Craftsman torque wrench. You know the incredibly accurate, easy to use flexible bar with the fixed pointer you read on an analog scale near the handle. Yes that old."

1885137,B00BB22GQM,The sound of a band getting better with age,"When Vampire Weekend&#8217;s third record, Modern Vampires of the City (2013), opens with a hymn to the Millennial Generation (&#8220;Obvious Bicycle&#8221;), it might not seem like the logical place to kick off an album-length wrestling match with lyricist/singer Ezra Koenig&#8217;s mortality. However, it begins to make sense when you consider the world many Millennials have to grow up in: a world of broken markets and revised expectations, a world where instant interconnectivity and growing alienation coexist uneasily, a world seemingly rich in material goods and poor in meaning. From &#8220;Unbelievers&#8221;: &#8220;I&#8217;m not excited, but should I be?&#8221;Ezra Koenig clearly finds growing up in such a world a mixed blessing. &#8220;Age is an honor,&#8221; he concedes on the harpsichord-tinged &#8220;Step,&#8221; but &#8220;it&#8217;s still not the truth.&#8221; The man singing those words is only twenty-nine. But that isn&#8217;t going to stop him from asking the kinds of questions that more often attend midlife crises:&#34;I want to know, does it bother you?The low click of a ticking clockThere&#8217;s a headstone right in front of youAnd everyone I know&#34; (&#8220;Don&#8217;t Lie&#8221;)Piling into the car with your girlfriend and driving into the sunset can&#8217;t banish the malaise (&#8220;Hannah Hunt&#8221;); even New York City itself is ultimately evanescent (&#8220;Hudson&#8221;).So Koenig turns to faith, or at least the vocabulary and iconography of faith, to help him come to grips with his own impermanence. Modern Vampires of the City is not a religious record by any means. But even as Koenig appears to reject him, a strange fascination somewhere between pity and awe draws him, in song after song, back to the God of his Hungarian Jewish fathers. Such a combative relationship to the Almighty has roots in the Hebrew tradition itself: like Jacob, Koenig is quite prepared to wrestle with God, &#8220;calling for the misery to always be explained&#8221; (&#8220;Worship You&#8221;). But unlike Jacob, Koenig&#8217;s struggles don&#8217;t appear to resolve into belief. As he sings on &#8220;Ya Hey&#8221; (a pun on the name of the Hebrew God):&#34;Zion doesn&#8217;t love youAnd Babylon don&#8217;t love youBut you love everythingOh, you saintAmerica don&#8217;t love youSo I could never love youIn spite of everything&#34;Lest you get the wrong impression, the music against which Koenig & Co. ponder such imponderables is anything but morose. Paul Simon&#8217;s Graceland has long been Vampire Weekend&#8217;s touchstone; and while they still take Simon&#8217;s perpetual observer status and coy melodic sensibilities as their basic blueprint, the skittish South African pop of their first two albums has been replaced here with a wider musical palette. Gorgeous harpsichords grace &#8220;Step&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t Lie&#8221;; energetic percussion and rock organ propel &#8220;Unbelievers&#8221;; &#8220;Worship You&#8221; surges forward with crisp snare and a full-throttle lyrical delivery; the smoky &#8220;Hudson&#8221; has an appropriately cinematic sweep. The band is particularly adept at layering instruments to build and release tension, so that no two verses even of the same song sound quite the same.Modern Vampires of the City closes with &#8220;Young Lion,&#8221; whose classical keyboards, string bass, and angelic choirs constitute another new phrase in the band&#8217;s vocabulary. The lyrics strike a comforting note: &#8220;Take your time, young lion.&#8221; For all his existential worries, Ezra Koenig still has forty-six years to answer his Big Questions (assuming average lifespan for an American male). In the meantime, he and Vampire Weekend are only getting better with age."

1408889,B0016BVYA2,"Single Player Mode Same, But Multiplayer Mose Makes Up For It","Single Player ModeWhile I agree that the gameplay hasn't changed much, the ability to dual wield a weapon and plasmid has made single player mode a lot better than the first. Obviously if you still haven't beaten the first one, and you aren't intereted in multiplayer, save yourself $40 and buy the original.Multi-player ModeLike most people, I was a bit skeptical of this new addition. In this mode you play as one of 8-10 stock characters (depending on if you got the pre-order bonus at gamestop). There are also many different games to choose from: capture the little sister (capture the flag), Adam Harvest - team mode or free-for-all(hold the little sister for 3 minutes), Civil War (get 50 kills as a team), Last Man Standing (can't remember its actual name, but it is what it sounds like), and a few others. Your character doesn't mean much, it just changes your catch phrases (which do get a bit annoying after a few hours of gameplay).Like the single player mode, there is a story behind these modes. Atlas and Ryan (from the first game) have provided you with the tools for ""home protection."" You must choose sides in the war that led to Bioshock 1.The leveling up system keeps the game pretty even, at each new level you get new plasmids, weapons, or bonuses. So you always are getting something new to try out. You gain experience from kills, assists, time holding the little sister, Adam vials you pick up (randomly placed on the map), taking a picture of your enemies (also gives you an attack boost on them until they kill you), and everytime you hack a machine.The gameplay itself is a lot of fun, because the levels are made the perfect size for the number of players. If you get into a battle it is a true war, because you are usually in a confined room. However,you can leave tight spaces in order to heal and grab EVE before getting back into the fray of things.Weapons include: pistol, machine gun, bazooka, grenades, shotgun, and more as you level up. Plasmids include: Incinerate, Electric Shock, Aero Dash, Freeze, Gysers, and a few more that are new as well as some from the first game. Bonuses include: faster health regeneration, evade enemy turrets easily,use less EVE, take faster pictures.Overall the single player is just an expansion of the first game, but the multi-player mode more than makes up for it. However, this is definitely one of those games that people will stop playing multiplayer once they get the achievements, so enjoy it now while everyone is online!"
1793458,B004Y74N7G,Perfect for lighting the way,"Installed two of these to cover areas not hit by the big spotlight.  Followed the recommended charging and now they work as described.

719257,B006JPS1OM,Hidden Objects Plus CSI Atmosphere,"If I were going to spend money on upgrading to a full game tonight, it would be this one. Although there were only three free levels, they felt like a decent chunk of gameplay - certainly enough to judge whether you want to buy the entire thing, and plenty to justify the free download for me.In addition to basic hidden objects, you also have to interview some witnesses, complete some small tasks (like reorganizing the forensic guy's tools) and find clues by tapping on areas of the scene. I was concerned that those extra bits would detract from the hidden objects, which is really the part I enjoy, but they were simple enough not to interrupt the flow and did add quite a bit to the atmosphere. The only problem I had was pulling the bullet out of the wall - but random finger movements seemed to do just fine, so there you are!The art style, character design, and dialog really captured the CSI-feel. I especially appreciated the not-quite-witty banter between the detectives - which is clearly designed to be just not quite witty and a little embarrassing for both of them. :)"
1357811,B0007TFLLC,"The PSP rocks, let's see how the games are...","Any gamer worth his or her salt will tell you that it doesn't matter what a system's specs are, it's the games that make it.  The Gamecube is a fine machine, but the utter lack of games is what's killing it, and the opposite is true for the Gameboy: hardly cutting edge (even the DS, which I also own), but keep the games rolling and people keep buying.I confess to being a techno-geek, so I was really impressed by the PSP.  It looks supermodel gorgeous, whereas the DS feels cheap and plasticky by comparison.  Here is my breakdown:PROS: Beautiful design.  Hey look, an Analog stick, hurrah!  Are you listing Nintendo?  AMAZING graphics.  The screen is enormous.  Ability to play music, view pictures, etc, though to be honest, I couldn't care less.  I have an MP3 player for my tunes and a computer for my files.  Let my PSP play games, and I'll be happy.  Small and efficient storage format.CONS: Power switch too close to right thumb when playing.  The proprietary UMD disc design is a bit worrisome, as is any non-standard format.  The whole movie aspect of PSP will crash and die within a year, guaranteed.  Why would you buy a movie for this unit when you can get the DVD for cheaper and you can play it in more places?  The unit feels a bit fragile and easy to scratch.  The battery life isn't great, but no surprise there.  That said, all those cons will die out when I can play Grand Theft Auto on my PSP, which should be this summer or fall!Overall, this is more an adult gamer's machine than a gameboy.  The look, feel and design is sleek, sexy and powerful.  It has the potential to humiliate the Gameboy in terms of power and versatility, though it remains to be seen if that will happen.  Until then, I'm content playing with both my DS and my PSP."
402928,B003UKM90Q,great brush!,"This is a great toothbrush with soft bristles and floss action which I found to be effective.  The small head makes it easy to get into tight spaces in the mouth (especially crowded teeth) and to focus on each tooth.  The timer is great for kids and keeps them brushing longer.

2981702,B000UNYJVI,Go watch grass grow instead.....you will have more fun!!!,"SPOILER ALERT.Man oh man what a bad film. I hope these people who were in the movie don't call themselves actors after this farce. Four `college' age youths who meet up in Fiji decide to track down a vice President's son Michael Rockefeller who disappeared in 1961 off the coast where the Asmat tribe reside in the Papua province of Indonesia. These kids think that by finding proof that he is still alive will bring them at least a million bucks so they decide to leave the comforts of Fiji and head off to Papua New Guinea. Well the movie up to this point had really sucked so I thought maybe now that they are headed into the danger that it may (for the love of all things holy) get better-it didn't. First of all, they all load up with back packs not much larger than what I used to take to school on a daily basis.  Second, with the available information given or lack thereof they do not have much hiking experience. Third, they are quoted as saying that the Papua province is the second most dangerous place in the world only behind Iraq yet they feel with their limited hiking experience, a single firearm and no guide that they might be `ok'. Now I know if horror films all made sense then there would be very few of them but I can state this in the case of this film because it is not horror, not suspenseful but just extremely boring. The four cant stop bitching at one another till one couple decide to leave on their only raft and leave the other couple stranded in order to get more of the money-plus they are tired of the other couples crap. They start to see natives along the shoreline and think that this might be a good time to get off the raft (bad idea for any of us) even though they have not been shown any signs of aggression. Once off the raft and into the jungle they are confronted and that's when Mike starts firing at the natives killing a couple but since there are twenty of them who have been trained their whole lives to use a bow and arrow, they make Mike pay for his wrongdoing. At this point the girl is running through the forest back to the river (that they should have never left) and this is when the `documentary style' filming hurts the film because no one (especially her) in that position is going to continue to film while running for their lives. Well rewind the tape now because the other stranded couple decides to make a perfectly good raft and proceed to do the exact same thing as the first couple including getting off the raft in a hostile area!! They find the bodies of their two friends and then some newly killed missionaries that they ran across earlier in their trip. Funny thinking about it now is that some were eaten and some were just killed. The other guy finds Mike half eaten so he does him a favor and shoots him with a gun in the middle of the night. Nothing like keeping a low profile when you are in a cannibal infested jungle!!. Finally the couple that is left find what appear to be different natives and these natives act like their friends until they kill them and cut them up. The end. And then I died................"

1526057,B00CMQTVK0,Good hardware with terrible software.  It will probably be good in one year after they debug the interface.,"I am xbox user, so I can not compare it to the Sony Playstation, only to the Xbox 360.  So ihope it helps current xbox360 users.At a high level I see the potential in the Xbox One, but it is clearly not ready for release, and not as good as the xbox360 is at this point.  I can not recommend a buy at this time.  You are much better off buying an Xbox360 for now.This is an early review so I will update it as time goes on and Microsoft fixes the console.Bad points:1. Interface is terrible.  Very difficult to figure out.  I really miss the blades pop-up from the 360.  microsoft really needs to fire the team that come up with the tiles interface and go back to the original xbox team.2. Can not play music while playing without using snap feature (this means you have to give up part of your screen to the music app.)3. The small bumps on the sticks made my thumb go numb in 1 hour.  I have still not recovered after 24 hours, my thumb is still sore.  Who came up with the great idea of adding sandpaper pattern to the thumbstick?4. Very few games available.5. TV feature does not work with broadcast TV, or cable without a cable box.  My cable company wants an extra $30 per month to get a box.  Sorry this part of xbox one will never be used by me, so it adds no value, and I can not review it.6. Kinect is focused towards the roof. Mine seems to not move.  I did not see any movement like the previous one.  This means the mounting has to be tilted. I have to put a book under the back side to tilt it so it can see the floor.The Good:1. The hardware is fast.2. Kinect has a high resolution camera and Skype works well.3. Very quick at switching between apps (e.g. a game and Netflix)4.

1624573,B003ZIR8YU,Surprisingly good cookies,"These are excellent and very tasty.  This is the best variety tin / box of cookies I've ever had (Pepperidge Farms, Royal Dansk, etc.)The only downside is the amount of wafer cookies in the box. I'd prefer more biscuit and shortcakes but still these are great overall.Definitely don't buy these if the temperature will be about 75 degrees or so.  Today the room temperature was 75 and the cookies were slightly moist and on the verge of leaving chocolate on my fingers when holding them.  I'd think by 80 degrees these would be melting somewhat so this tin definitely shouldn't be ordered late spring to late summer (May-Sept)."

This toy was a big hit!  We put a smear of peanut butter in the cup (but it's big enough to put a small handful of granola or sunflower seeds or whatever.)  At first our little Ramona went crazy trying to figure out where the peanut butter was.  She could smell it but never expected to find it hanging from the top of her cage.  She climbed the cage like a monkey, worked her way towards the toy, tried to get at the peanut butter while dangling from the toy, realized that wasn't going to work, and started trying to get the toy closer to the side of the cage.  She was entertained and happy for a good half hour.  Plus she got some exercise and a peanut butter treat!  I'm sure she'll destroy it eventually, but this toy isn't that expensive to replace, so I'll just get another once she's had her fun chewing this one to bits.  Ramona gives it 5 stars!"
3290749,B004EQAVFU,A Haunting Version of a Fine Novel,"Kazuo Ishiguro's best selling novel NEVER LET ME GO has been transformed into a screenplay by Alex Garland that condenses the novel but allows the mystery of the writer's concept to come shining through.  Mark Romanek directs a perfect cast and manages to make the whole strange idea of the story seem hauntingly real.Through the mists of England develops the image of a tranquil appearing old school,  Hailsham,  a special school where the students are all selected, segregated from society to be taught and nurtured into becoming transplant donors.  The school is run by Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) who is strict but also benevolent.  The story focuses on three students - Tommy (Charlie Rowe), Kathy (Isobel Meikle-Small), and Ruth (Ella Purnell).  Kathy longs for Tommy's affections but Ruth is the bolder of the two girls and makes her feelings for Tommy known. The only person who brings a semblance of reason and solace to the students is Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins): she is dismissed as insubordinate for telling the truth to the students. The students age into young people - Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) have become a couple and have also begun their donations of organs while Kathy (Carey Mulligan) has taken the role of Carer and follows the lives of the two friends.  As Ruth approaches her third organ donation she expects to enter 'completion' and clears her guilt of having taken Tommy from Kathy by joining Kathy and Tommy in a romance that she hopes will lead to a state of delay (the school has always informed them that if two students are truly in love they will be spared their destiny for a while in order to live together).  Tommy is an artist and thinks that by proving his presence of a soul that he and Kathy will be granted this choice.  Hailsham has now closed and the two seek the art gallery curator for the school Madame (Nathalie Richard) to request permission, only to be met by both Miss Emily and Madame with the reality that the concept has been a false one all along.  The destiny of the students is served.The trio of actors - Mulligan, Garfield, Knightley - is superb, seducing us into believing in the story. The supporting roles as performed by Rampling, Richard, and Hawkins are equally strong.  This film, as the book, requires the audience to relinquish disbelief in the premise and instead bask in the beauty of the story, the acting, the lush cinematography by Adam Kimmel and the stunningly lovely musical score by Rachel Portman. Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, February 11"

1862161,B00007KK7V,Massive are back with their best LP since 'Blue Lines',"Here's a few parallels:In 1991 Massive Attack came to the attention of a wider audience against the backdrop of President George Bush going to war with Iraq.After a period of boom, Britain was in recession. Music became tougher, hardcore and techno replaced the piano jingles of Italo-house...And Massive's 'Blue Lines' sprang from nowhere, killing the tempo with gurgling dub bass lines and swaddling us in luxurious strings and a lullaby of intimate vocals.Some twelve years later and, after a five year gap, Bristol's slowest working crew is about to return with their fourth album, George Bush is president and threatening war with Iraq and......need we labour the point?Mushroom has of course departed the band and Marshall ducked out for this album, but Del Naja's '100th Window' is every bit the production masterpiece its predecessors are - in places harkening back to, if not quite matching, the collective's glorious debut.'100th Window' is characteristically textured and Massive remain one of the few outfits that handle vocals as well as they orchestrate intricate drum patterns - as witnessed by the inter-lacing snares and high hats accompanying Sinead O'Connor as she whispers directly into your middle ear on 'What Your Soul Sings'.Sinead takes on Shara Nelson's role on the LP, contributing vocals to 'Special Cases' and, most notably, on a toughened up re-working of 'Safe From Harm' called 'A Prayer For England'.Meanwhile Horace Andy delivers his residential stylised vocal through the dub and bass-step of 'Name Taken' and 'Everywhen'.There are more strings and washes on this album than on the first three LPs and what sounds like a cross between an electricity pylon and a tuning fork joins the dots between songs, bridges a mid-song break down and rides a subtly chaotic percussion pattern.Dark passages rest on plectrumed guitar-lines and Asian influenced rhythms, while heavy, discordant bowed strings sear across tracks such as the ultra moody 'Butterfly Caught' and 'Antistar'.As ever, it's the minutiae (a sudden dip in the bass-line key or an a-rhythmic electronic percussive pulse) that keeps your attention locked.And although the pace remains downbeat, accompanying patterns refer to bangra and drum 'n' bass, as high hats skip and splutter between the hip hop tempo of snare and kick drum.Every time Massive release an album they're asked to conjure up the near impossible - a record that's fresh, while still sounding unmistakably like Massive Attack. This time it sounds like they've succeeded."

86165,B007YYUUA0,I hate this headset,"I didn't think I'd hate this headset, but I do.  It looked perfectly fine, seemed to pair pretty easily when I turned it on.  But then, it said ""please wait"" for 10-15 minutes while attempting to download my admittedly large address book.  What if I don't want to download the address book?  What if I don't want to wait 15 minutes?But then we come to the biggest reason for my 1 star rating.  Range and reception are terrible.  There is all sorts of noise and crackles when trying to use this bluetooth headset.  The noises are the sort that you would expect when you are leaving the headset's effective range.  Yet, I was very close to the phone, so there's no way I should have been getting so much noise that I was having difficult hearing the other party and vice-versa.  I then switched over to a Motorola HX550, which I think is pretty good.  All of the BlueAnt's problems immediately went away and I could carry on a conversation without all of the noise, pops and static.Sound quality isn't that great even absent the aforementioned noise/range issues.  The headset's pre-programmed voice prompts are very rich and clear.  So I thought that if those prompts sounded great, the unit probably had pretty solid tonal quality and calls would also probably sound pretty full and rich.  Nope, that wasn't at all the case.  Tonal quality was mediocre, at best.I hate this headset and probably won't ever use it again.  1 star.  Recommend that you avoid it."
1777381,B003629WRQ,Wall & Pipe (and automotive) Inspection Camera,"I bought this so I could look around corners. Really.My first project involved a jacuzzi tub that had stopped working. I suspected that the air switch (which controls the electric switch) had failed. Using this I removed the air switch and found that the small air tube had fallen off. Used the included hook to fish the fallen tube out and reattached it using a bit of glue. So this paid for itself the first time I used it!I also used it to look under dashboards in cars without having to crawl in upside down. It has a night vision function which allows you to see in dark areas, this is really useful. The screen is pretty small, but it is in color (except, obviously, in night vision.) Just recently I used it to locate water leaks inside of a wall. If you are in the home repair or automotive repair business, this is a great tool to have."

1594410,B001LG945O,Switch?  Ummm ... no.,"I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of breakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals/8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar/serving -- I cannot recommend Switch."

3266855,B0041KKYDI,5 Days Later,"He's been on a roll ever since 2002's28 Days Later, and Danny Boyle has done it again. Another excellent movie. But this time you have to give James Franco a lot of the credit, because after all...127 Hours really is a one man show.127 Hours is a true story. As the title of mountain climber Aron Ralston's autobiography suggests, he literally gets himself stuckBetween a Rock and a Hard Place. If you're not already familiar with Ralston's story, don't be mislead by the 127 Hours promotional poster or DVD cover that shows what you're supposed to assume is Ralston stuck without a rope high above the ground with only a small boulder between him and a fall to his death. Oh there is indeed a small boulder involved in Ralston's plight, but it is not helping him in any way, shape or form.If you're looking for more than a story about perseverance, strength and character, you may be in the wrong place. Sure there is some beautiful scenery in 127 Hours, and a small amount of dialogue, but what 127 Hours is really about is one man's will to live and the torturous 5 day episode that will lead to survival or certain death. Sound boring? I kinda thought so. But the reviews suggested otherwise as did the award nominations. Not that award nominations guarantee anything, and there are certain critics that I often disagree with, but the award nominations were justified and the critics are right about 127 Hours. Danny Boyle and James Franco have created a masterpiece here. The movie is well directed and Franco's performance made me feel like I was an ant on a boulder watching Ralston's ordeal as it was actually happening.127 Hours is the best movie I've seen in a long time. Check it out or take a hike; just watch out for the loose boulders if you choose the latter."

What Uncle Frank could not have done with this light...he owned a garage and did wrecking and other work. He used the old penlights, and this would have just WOWED him.6 and 3/8ths inches long. Light weight. Hook on your shirt, or whatever, or use magnetic clip, and have hands free lighting. Used mine to bring in my new microwave from the car, just a bit ago. Lit the way just fine.Bottom turns to right to remove batteries, only about 1/4 turn...uses 3 AAA batteries, positive end first...I think the box at the store said 10 hour run time, which is really pretty good...my 200 lm tactical does 100 lm for 3 hours, so 60 lumen for 10 hours is awesome.Purchased locally for around 8-something.Lights up a whole room with a good, wide, no spot glow. It is a blurred area light, not a spotlight. In the dining room and kitchen, from one end, will light up the whole area...bright. Outside, it is not a spotlight...so does not shine across the street too well, but the yard is lit well, the steps and door are well lit, easy to find the key hole, we had some fog, so that hindered things.Will use some Ansmann AAA Rechargeable batteries when the originals are used up.I hope they hold up, because it is a great light.

You do need to be a little careful though....I wound up with some sort of seed (maybe Flax) that was as hard as wood and incapable of being chewed.  That could have been a problem if I bit into it the wrong way.Cereal in general is not good for you.  It is not the worst thing you can eat, but it is not really good. I think this cereal is a rare exception, and you can feel great about eating it with your favorite milk or yogurt.  I double the portion size, add a cup of milk and it is a great meal and not too high in calories."
3029171,B0013J55B6,One of the Worst Superhero movies ever.,"I can accept a movie for what it is for, a comic book, an action thriller, a comedy, a parody, etc. This movie wasn't sure what it wants to be. Will Smith is terrible, his acting was totally bland and as though he forgot how to act or simply didn't even like his part. Parts of the movie just drag on like they wanted to save money instead of creating action. And in the end the movie contradicts its own premises on the characters. And definitely no funny parts either. Worst part is no good explanation of how things got to where they were, the few explanations that were provided were very weak.Overall a boring movie and not recommended."

1581266,B001D6B0SG,WARNING - Delectable Aroma May Incite Direct Consumption From The Jar,"WARNING: As tempting as it may be, eating salt directly from the jar is not recommended as it poses a significant health risk.  Ingestion of pure salt can be fatal, and purposeful consumption of saturated salt solutions is a method of suicide, common at one time in China.  If you've read some of the other reviews, you know how appealing the aroma of this product is.  Practically makes you want to inhale it.  Or just eat it directly from the jar . . . it's almost good enough to stand alone.Okay, I love this stuff, but even I don't eat it by itself.  I say that it's almost good enough to stand alone, because I use it as the primary seasoning for my bread-dipping oil.  It's an idea I borrowed from a restaurant, when I was trying to figure out how to eat this stuff straight out of the jar without causing bodily harm.I like to serve it at dinner in individual dipping bowls with a nice hearty or rustic loaf of bread.  I start with about a ounce of good olive oil (PONS Early Harvest Arbequina Extra Virgin Olive Oil 16 oz), some fresh cracked pepper (Frontier Gourmet Peppercorns, Pink 0.88 Oz Grinder Bottle both for aesthetics and flavor), and just over 1/8 tsp of thisSelezione Tartufi Black Truffle Salt 10%, 3.5 Ounce Unit, stir and pour into a tiny dish to be placed at each plate.  My family enjoys this is as a cholesterol-free and slightly fancier alternative to butter.  It's salty, but really tasty as an occasional treat."

1832648,B000002BRB,Will the real Kenny Loggins please stand up?,"I sometimes have a hard time getting a handle of what Kenny Loggins is all  about. Is he the good ol' boy we got to know with Jim Messina, the  womanizing wild man out to make a few bucks with over commercialized  &quot;hook&quot; songs from B rated movies (Footloose, Caddy Shack and Top  Gun) or the  spiritual New Age love and honesty spokesman we find in this  new CD and book. I had the opportunity to listen to Kenny play and talk  about his book/Cd in front of about 100 people in San Diego. His music from  this CD was clear and powerful, but all the deep soul talk made me wonder  if he's taking the world and particularly himself a little too seriously.  The music is solid and appears to be from the heart, but under all the  positive spin, you'll sometimes find yourself hearing nothing more than  fluff. This effort isn't quite up to speed with his recent Leap of Faith CD  (five stars) but it does have brilliant moments of song and emotion that  will keep you looking for his next release. I would recommend you give the  CD a listen and the book a rest."
3074301,B001F7Q4IO,Don't monkey around with this one...,"Andy Samberg = HilariousCheryl Hines = HilariousPut them in a movie together and you get; boring?Okay, so not a movie, but an animated film.  I would never have guessed that two of my favorite comedians (well, not favorites, but I like them very much) would NOT perform very good voice over work.  I really thought that they would excel here, but they are bland and uninteresting.  Patrick Warburton, on the other hand, should do EVERY cartoon, seriously.  In fact, if it weren't for his quick wit and stellar voice skills I would have given this mundane monkey mess ONE star.  He bumps this drudgery up to a D grade for me.With an array of predictable and tiresome `chimp' jokes, `Space Chimps' makes very little of a promising concept.  When a probe goes through a time warp and disappears a group of monkeys trained for space are sent up in a ship to make sure that the warp is safe for humans (if the monkeys melt or explode or combust or whatever then they know NOT to send the humans).  The only problem is that the monkeys actually think that they are astronauts, so when they get to the planet they think they are really on a mission of great importance.  Add to that the fact that the planet they land on has been hostilely taken over by a tyrant using the probe as a weapon and you have an adventure for these little primates.It's too bad it's not interesting.The storyline built for the alien world is clich&eacute;d and mediocre, offering nothing new except a poorly developed rehashing of previous alien films.  Jeff Daniels voice work is unrecognizable and obnoxious and horrible and, well, yeah; all of that.  The creatures are boring and simple, all except Kilowatt (her scene in the cave made me chuckle a bit, even if it was a ridiculous play on emotions).  It's just a poorly made film all the way around.It's lazy.  That's the best way to put it.  This is a lazy attempt at money.  They took a pretty neat idea and wasted it by putting zero effort into making it spectacular.  There are many, many animated films out there MUCH better than this pile of dookie.  Watch one of those.Oh yeah, and next time, give Jane Lynch a bigger part!"

1875350,B000MQ51E2,The Blandness,"If ""The Weirdness"" is an indication at The Stooges' current state, then it's sure fire blasphemy. With an album track list that basically speaks for the lyrics itself, The Stooges have carved what may be one of the most recent disappointments in a band's history.Nothing stands out and when it does the sound is hampered by vocals that sound too polished or clean to be considered Iggy Pop. Where is the brash noise of Raw Power, inarguably one of the greatest pieces of rock material in history? Where are the fitting yet congested solos? There is none of that and even worse, the lyrics are so pitiful that the music is unlistenable.It's a sad story to hear. Band comes out of retirement, band makes the press, and band creates new stuff yet band fails in every possible way. The only reason ""The Weirdness"" might deserve two stars is because this is after all an effort that seemed unnecessary to begin with and the album puts the band back on the road. To think, just twenty seconds of Dinosaur Jr.'s new material is better than the thirty to forty minutes of nonsense this offers.Nevertheless, nobody should complain if The Stooges decide to use their back catalog on the road. The band should. Otherwise, the concert might be just as bad. Save your money this Tuesday and buy something else (e.g. The Arcade Fire) or if you haven't already, buy ""Raw Power"" or ""Fun House.""Trust me, you'll be better off."

1874310,B000GGSMJ4,Close your eyes and relax...,"Ahh, finally Skye's debut made it stateside, but i should warn you all, this is not a Morcheeba record. No reggae, trip hop funky sounds are to be found here.The sweet velvety voiced singer gets to showcase her own talents in her mature debut and she's got quite a few gems up her sleeve with her own soothing chill out melodies and personal songwritting.Love show opens the album with a very radio friendly hook and with some of the most romantic lyrics i heard in a while ""sit down, give me your hand, i'm gonna tell you the future, i see you, living happily with somebody who really suits ya, someone like me"", perfect love confession i might say. This is my top favorite track of the album (I hope it gets released as a single).""Stop Complaining"" is an insomniac's confession with a bit of a country music echo, I like this one alot too. ""Solitary"" is a melancholy piece with lots of tension, followed by ""Calling"" which has some acoustic guitars and really sweet lyrics ""love is calling, open up, and let life shine, i'm calling"", she's crooning sensual seductive and comforting.""What's Wrong With Me"" is the first single of the album, it's gotten quite alot of airplay on some local radio stations here in Boston, it is another confessional & mellow track where Skye expresses her worries, trying not to think of lots of upsetting things, basically daily live's annoyances and the situations that surround us (regulations, rain, empires and stupid fools, voice mails, emails, TV, the future), she's asking herself ""What's wrong with me""? I'd say a more proper question would be ""what's wrong with the world"".""No Other"" is a hazy track that i really didn't get into too much, but ""Tell me about your day"" is another excellent track, the writting is excellent and so is her singing once again. She's talking about New Orleans in St. Patrick's day, describing the scenery while she's talking to someone far away asking them to tell her about their day. This could make an excellent single, the Electronic Valve instrument along with the violin sounds bring a uniquely sweet sentimentality to the track.""All the promises"" is a break up song, dramatic but quite dark, followed by ""Powerful"" which is another radio friendly track with more epic violin sounds in the background with more of a mainstream soft rock sound to it, and a bit reminiscent of her Morcheeba songs (Charango era time).""Say Amen"" is another dark and hushed track with a bit of hushed jungle undercurrents towards the end, again not a track i'm too fond of in the CD, but the last song ""Jamaica Days"" is simply divine. An acappella track that trully makes you travel along with its mesmerizing melody, a great finish to a great solo debut.Skye is not breaking new ground with these songs, but it's a great start and a bit of a departure from what we were used to hear her sing with Morcheeba. I love her voice, i liked the arrangements and i really enjoy listening to her solo debut's confessional songs."

And that's why ""Night of the Demons"" is what Carbon Dioxide gas would be if it were a movie: odorless, colorless, tasteless, scareless, and deadly dull.

Despite heaps of atmosphere, a moody setting, the coolest animated credits in horror movie history, and two red smoking hot leads (Mimi Kinkade and Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), ""Night of the Demons"" is all set-up and zero pay-off.

To be brutally honest, apart from the brief eye-gouging scene, the little fun you'll have with this turgid flick---assuming you love horror movies, that is---is if you fast forward to the end of the movie, where you'll see what happens to nasty old men who hate Halloween.Had Tenney capitalized on the film's final four minutes of Grand-Guignolesque nastiness throughout ""Night of the Demons"", this would have been an unabashed four-star romp. Alas, ""Night"" is bloodless and toothless.If you're a horror movie completist, you'll check this thing out---I realize that.I'm writing this review simply as a warning beacon: do not go into ""Night of the Demons"" unarmed. Do not go with high hopes. Do not expect a gore-encrusted goulash a la Dan O'Bannion's ""Return of the Living Dead"", as I, seeing Quigley's name on the credits, did. Do not think that the cool intro animations, the Borgo Pass 1980's Bauhaus tunes, the red smoking hot presence of Kinkade & Quigley, and the awesome glory of the mirror shot promise you a satisfying horror flick.In summary: Do not crash this party with high expectations or you won't be ""partying hearty"" when the credits roll. First off, director Tenney took out a big bloody scalpel and ripped off the infinitely superior Italian gore maestro Lamberto Bava: ""Night of the Demons"" is basically Bava's disgustingly satisfying ""Demons"" & ""Demons 2"" without the fun, the scares, or the gore.In those films, it is true you have to suffer idiotic dialogue and excruciating dubbing, but you are rewarded for your patience. By contrast, unless you like watching complete idiots wander through darkened hallways crying out for each other, you'll never get a satisfying payoff from this well-appointed, searingly dull waste of time and celluloid.Yes, Mimi Kinkade's dance to the sepulchral ""Stigmata Martyr"" made me run out and buy the Bauhaus ""Singles:1: CD. But style aside---and at times, ""Night of the Demons"" has style in spades, leaving the viewer in the hellish limbo of always expecting that the film is about to get good---what's the point?What's the point of a horror flick that never delivers the tricks and treats? What's the point of a movie about demonic possession when the red sauce never really flies? How is it possible for mere mortals to evade demons merely by walking down a hallway a few feet and turning right, while the supposedly rampaging demon ambles on in the other direction?Why is it that the high school sweethearts, murdered while making out in a coffin buck-naked, dutifuly don their clothes as undead demons before slaughtering their schoolmates?I'm a lenient horror fan and gorehound; I don't ask much. What I ask for is this: goop, gore, blood, and scares. ""Night of the Demons"" is about as scary as a haunted house held at a local church. Two stars for the delicious Quigley (with her extra-storage space for lipstick) and the luminous Kinkade (who devours the camera every second she's on), 1/2 star for the eye-gouging and razor blade finale. This is the rare instance in which you should ditch Angela's ""party"" and hit the high school stomp instead. You'll be glad you did.JSG"

131220,B009S3M1ZC,why would you waste your time to buy this. why.,"I waited for like a month for this and when it finally came in the mail it was pretty bad. First off, it looks more light blue than it does green the picture lies. there's still the sharp lines on the side where they didn't tear it off the plastic molding good enough. It barely fits on the sides of my phone. They have a cut out on the top of the case for you to turn off your phone but you can't use it at all because it's too deep. There's a big long cut out for the rest of the buttons on the side that's also awkward and too deep. The material its made out of is complete crap I literally can make this by myself it's so crappy.So over all its ugly, it hurts my hands physically to hold, it doesn't fit and I can barely use the buttons and it's just terrible.You get what you pay for lol"

2687722,B0001DMW9S,A Powerful Movie!,"A touching and powerful movie based on the true story of a doctor's plight in the Auschwitz death camp.  You can almost feel this woman's terror and despair as she and her family were herded to the Nazi death camps. Once there, the doctor had to witness innumerable atrocities that would haunt her forever.  Only her will to survive, and her desire to help other women kept her alive.  And yet, even though she had courageously made it through the nightmare and ultimately found her freedom in America, she had to go through yet another ordeal when a government panel all but accused her of wrongdoing at Auschwitz and tried to ban her from practicing medicine in the United States.This is a must see movie that will stay with you forever."
78541,B007C8BCB4,great case,I got this to replace the original one I bought at ATT. It was fraying on the edges and was actually falling off the phone. Admittedly I do take the cover off about 1/day to switch batteries. After it arrived I found out the original was covered by a year warranty so I returned my original to ATT for a new one and will keep this one in a safe place as the original warranty is only good for a year and the replacement if good for 90 days. I am sure I will wear another one out and the one from Amazon is way cheaper than the original at ATT.

These seemed worth a try for the price, but I did not like this at all.  I knew it would be more powerful than regular ginger ale, but wow - the taste was overwhelming to the point that it did not even taste like ginger ale - more like carbonated water and ginger root powder.  Also - with every sip, there is an odd sensation in your mouth/sinus cavity!  I didn't say anything to anyone, but then they had it too.  I don't think it's anything dangerous and was interesting; it's probably the body's way of reacting to TOO MUCH ginger!!  Make it stop!"

1317990,B00004WMVL,Almost a disgrace to the RE series,"In Resident Evil: Survivor, you play an amnesia stricken man wandering around a zombie infested town looking for clues to his past.  The first thing you'll notice about the game is it's first person perspective and that the game was clearly meant to use a light gun prepheral but does not (yet it's Japanese counterpart does).  That major drawback, combined with the choppy animation, muddy sound, poor controls, and near none replayability, make Resident Evil: Survivor one big disappointment of a game.  It's worth playing if your a longtime fan of the Resident Evil series, but don't expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga.  Capcom has once again made another first person light gun aimed Resident Evil game called Resident Evil: Dead Aim for the PS2, and that game is quite an improvement over this piece of crud."

180027,B00FGR5XKE,"Great sound, great looks","The speaker stand works on a very simple concept, just a plain stand and side firing speakers.  It is built solidly with thick gauge aluminum.  I got the coffee brown color which is officially called ""business brown.  It is also available in champagne gold, light magenta, kiwi green, dodger blue and silveng white (typo probably).  The color and the paint is great - I think it is baked paint.  Just that the brown seems not matching any of my devices.  If I would have to order it, I would order a different color to match my silver iPad Air.It can accommodate most iPads and tablets, phablets and phones.  I put my Air and an Android tablet and it looks great. The stand has rubber pads with really nice grip.  It hugs the tabletop like a gecko.  The left and right speakers are protected with a metal grill.When you turn on the the slide switch at the back, the Bluetooth transmitter immediately looks for a device to pair on.  The sound is great with considerable bass and thumps.Cons:Limited to one angle of viewing.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes."

The staging was unusual I guess, but took nothing away from the outstanding performances of Anna Netrbeko and Rolando Villazon.  While some people may prefer more traditional settings, I have seen several productions of LaTraviata and this I would have to consider the best in my opinion.  Loved it."
1721361,B000BQWOHA,Will not work with anything but a flood light,It does not say so but this unit will not work with anything but a flood light and that is questionable.  A fluorescent burns out in a couple hours and incandescent blinks and burns out.  Only good if you need a high power flood light.  I am returning mine and try to find something that will work in a porch light socket.

1802518,B006LQFHN2,"Easy to install, especially in older homes with no neutral wire","If you need z-wave lighting, these are relatively affordable, as z-wave lighting goes. Most importantly, especially relative to the non-dimming version, these can be used to replace existing switches which only have two wires (i.e. without access to a neutral wire). The unit will just steal power from the light circuit by letting a trickle of current through the light; enough to power itself but not enough to light up the light. The cost for this convenience is that these dimmers will only work with incandescent bulbs. This DEFINITELY won't work with a CFL, and it probably won't work with LED lighting, either. The reason is that the dimmer needs the load (light) to look pretty much like a wire with small resistance. As another tip, make sure you have a functioning bulb in the socker when you try to set this up, as if the bulb is missing or burned out, the device won't be powered and you won't be able to enroll it with your controller.UPDATE: To those who have had problems with reliability, and prospective buyers: These work by sucking power from a two wire circuit, one side of which includes the bulb itself. So, when the bulb burns out this switch loses all power. It will appear to your controller to be a malfunction. I'm not saying this is what is happening in all cases people complain of reliability, but when somebody finds that half of their devices break after a while, I suspect what is happening is that their lights are burning out."
3628722,B000GZ4SWU,Helped Guppy fin rot,"Fin rot on long tailed fish can be a recurring and hard to treat problem, the males nip each other's tails causing a way for bacteria to get in. If the tail rots down too far, it infects the body and fish die from this. This product was helpful in clearing it up. (Furan-2 is another product that I had some success with.)Because the effectiveness of different antibiotics depends on your unique tank parameters, it is important to try different treatments to determine what works best. We have high ph and hard water so dumping antibiotics in the tank water was ineffective. Soaking antibiotics in water and food before adding to the tank worked the best for us."
1697157,B00004VWKQ,Has issues with nicked blades and sharpness doesn't last long,"Used a diamond stone for years and tried this because I get bored sharpening a knife for 10 mins.This is good for cheap steel to get a decent edge quickly but you'd be insane to use this on expensive German or Japanese blade.  Using this on a couple Chicago Cutlery, after the initial shaving huge chucks of steel off it to prime the angle to it, it was easy enough and quick to sharpen but it was not as sharp as the diamond stone and 6 months later I would rate the edge as not sharp now.  The diamond stone last longer and is sharper.Not everyone wants to use a stone to do it themselves but I can't imagine a professional chef using this to sharpen their tools of the trade.  The chefs and barbers I know spend $50 to have a professional come and sharpen them once a year."

It would be nice if the light could be focused or directed to one area out of the box but you have to buy an additional accessory for this. It is heavy and well made. Replacement bulbs run on the spendy side ~~$40-50.Hopefully I'll get several years of use out of the one that came with the light.The handle has held up so far but seems like it could break if you pull on the assembly too hard.

1559343,B000HDI5OS,Dented cans,"About half the cans in my case were dented, and it certainly looks to me that they must have been dented before being packaged together into my case (cans in the middle of the pack have side dents, for example).  I had intended to include a can or two into care packages destined for American soldiers (a little taste of Thanksgiving, and the cans are pretty enough to be decorative).  But, I can't be sending dented cans to our troops -- and I don't want to eat from dented cans myself, so I'm vexed.  For purposes of this review, I opened a good can to taste the product, and the product tastes good.  It certainly costs enough.  I would have been quite happy with this if I didn't find half the goods were damaged (I consider them unusable), and I didn't think that I was intentionally bamboozled by someone trying to dump dented cans."

No matter, CR2032 batteries are readily available.Update two months later - it worked for the first project, but when I recently tried to use it, it's dead. Inserting a new battery causes the display to flash, then nothing.  Too late to return it... $28 down the drain.  Bummer."

The previews certainly didn't give me a fair idea what I was about to subject myself to. Had I seen it in a cinema, it would have been the very first movie I'd ever walked out on.Really. It was that bad.Movies should entertain, tell a story, make one think, or any combination of the above. ""Tree of Life"" was not entertaining, didn't tell a coherent story, and the only things it made me think were: 1) This would make a great screensaver, 2) It would probably be *fascinating* if marijuana were legal, and 3) I bet the critics adored it. There was only the barest suggestion of a ""plot,"" interrupted by tedious, dreamlike sequences punctuated by whispered, non-informative voice-overs. This guy Malick must be the Yoko Ono of movies.People whose self esteem depends on being seen as intellectual should definitely watch it, make up what it was supposed to mean, then parrot that back to everyone else in their glowing 5-star reviews. Oh. I see they're already on top of that."

They  lose there charge in about two weeks if not used so every time you need one  you have to wait overnight or over a long day to use it.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am with these. I've gone back to an electric cord drill because when I need to drill I need it now not tomorrow.  I'll never buy another product from  this company.  Personally I'd be embarrassed to put such a product on the market.  They're junk.  Oh and they run down very fast.

The sound quality is adequate for the low price and I don't have to worry about a bluetooth headset losing its charge during my walk.  Also tried it while using a noisy stationary bike and I could still hear with the headset plugged into the jack on my stereo. Would I use this to listen to beautiful music when I wanted to appreciate subtlety of sound. Probably not.update - it doesn't work at all and my other headsets do. Bought one at the Dollar Store to troubleshoot the jack and it worked perfectly.

183790,B00GAVCNZI,Lovable lipstick flashlight and charger,This &#34;lipstick&#34; battery-flashlight is perfect for especially to carry with to work.  Here's why I love this:* It is a fast charger at over 2A - you cannot easily find something in this size that can charge a cellphone quickly.* It's a true flashlight.  No more need to carry the old and probably bigger flashlight.  One can use all the battery power for the flashlight and still come out ahead.* The lanyards are cool.  I used a bent paperclip to work the neck lanyard through and it looks and feels great like that.  There's also a wrist lanyard for more specialized use.* The cables are great - two sizes with one conveniently short for cell phone charging.  Use the same cable to power up battery that use to power phone from battery.  It can hardly be simpler.I received a promotional sample.  My wife uses this daily and loves it.

My only complaint is that there is little protection if the phone is dropped on the area where the cables plug into the phone.  On my case there is nothing but the soft rubber strips that bridge across this area.  My sister has the same phone and ordered anb Otterbox case in purple from Amazon and it actually has the hard plastic bridging this area as well as the soft rubber strips.  It also has soft rubber plugs to cover the ports, which adds even more strength and durability.  Wish I'd known about one like this.  For now I'm okay with the case I have but will definitely replace it when necessary with the stronger version.  I did find the screen protector included with the case to be difficult to apply, so much so that I trashed it after several attempts to do a good job at it.

326133,B001F51VS4,"It's a cream, not a solid.  I didn't find it very effective in a hot and humid environment.","We live in Florida and it's very hot and humid here - the perfect environment to give this product a fair test.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't find anything exceptional about Secret Clinical Strength (Light and Fresh) to justify its hype or price tag.  I've been using Secret products for over a decade and had high expectations for this product.  However, even after using it as instructed (apply at night before bed), after a week I broke down and started wearing my regular Secret deodorant again.The scent isn't too over powering but neither is it subtle.  I can't imagine how overwhelming the more strongly scented varieties must be.  After a week of use I may not be producing quite as much perspiration as I did before using this product, but I'm also not exactly ""fresh"" at the end of the day (even without a lot of exertion).  I'm better off applying the less expensive regular formula twice a day than using this formula as directed.Also, it really bothers me that they have marketed this product as a solid when in fact it is a cream.  I abhor cream and gel deodorants and go out of my way to find ""invisible"" solids as I detest the ""wet"" feeling that gels and creams have upon application."

1474974,B004FSE52C,Incredible,"Okay, this game isn't perfect, but it is deserving of 5 stars!  And in case anyone is wondering this game is a prequel to all other Tomb Raider games!Graphically it's one of the best games I've seen.  Excellent voice work, acting, and animations.  The platforming aspects are extremely well done for the most part and there is lots of interaction.  The combat consists primarily of gun/arrow play (which is fun), but there are melee moves and instant deaths move you can pull off too.  An interesting upgrade system too keeps the player thinking.There are a lot of little quick time events in here, but they're well done unlike a lot of games.  It actually adds to the cinematic feel of the game.  Despite all of the possible exploring and upgrading this really is like playing a movie in some ways.The only real complaints I could mention are occasional game freezing glitches and that the map system is often inaccurate.  I mean if a document for instance is shown on the map that document may or may not actually be there.  This cuts down replayability for me.  Other than that it's a really fun game that's definitely worth playing!"
1694911,B00004RH24,Dewalts quality is questionable these days,"I'm fairly disappointed with this set. One of the bits bent after using it for less than 15 minutes and the protective sleeves on both magnetic drive guides pretty much broke off or ripped off due to use from rubbing against material.  I own a lot of Dewalt tools and accessories and this set let me down. It also seems like their blades have become questionable as well, now that all this stuff is made in China there is no quality control anymore."
3653243,B0017JBC2I,I'm so glad this is available.,"I hate most Chinchilla foods as they are completely unbalanced and can only purchase a 3lb bag at a pet store. I am all for Oxbow, but it tends to run a little expensive. This is a great price for a 10lb bag. You really can't beat it for an Oxbow product. Also, my Chinchilla loves this food more than the rest. I love that Oxbow tailors only towards small pets - it makes me feel better about whats being fed to my small pets."
1301214,B002VA464S,The Yeti Lives on Top of the Mountain,"I have used many microphones, from  expensive Neumanns, Sennheisers, Sure, AKG to the less expensive Berringer B2 Pro and Sony. I spent over 8 years in professional radio and 30 plus years doing voice over recording and sound mixing, so I have heard and used all types of mics and I have to rate the Blue Yeti at the top of my list for many reasons. First is sound quality, all the patterns have a smooth, open sound, the cardioid pattern has added richness for voice over work, comparable dare I say to a Sennheiser or Sure. The sound in all the patterns was not colored or muted at any frequency level, which what is I was expecting in the stereo mode, but in that pattern, voices sound great and an acoustic guitar sounded rich, plucky and natural. Next is the construction of the mic and stand, from the pictures I was expecting plastic, nope, it is made of very solid metal , except the buttons and switches. Third is the versatility, you can record almost anything in any type of circumstance not just adequately, but with excellence, try that with a $2,000.00 Neumann! The set up could not be easier, just plug it into your USB jack and let her rip. I only paid $100.00 on Amazon,a true bargain, for what is a top notch piece of gear, where the engineers of this product really took their time to design something of real quality and looks like a piece of art. The Yeti also stands up to audio processing, where I have to say all of the other mics I have used for under $200.00 show their weaknesses. The only thing I would like to see is a shock mount made for this mic, it is just too big for all of my other mounts, but the Yeti does not seem to pick up as much vibration from the table as other mics do (I also use a slab of 1/4"" neoprene padding to absorb some table shock), and the Yeti has no real audible self noise. If you want a great microphone at an incredible price, the Blue Yeti is the one for you!Addendum 9-30-2011My complaint about the shock mount has been resolved, with the Blue Radius, which I received a week ago from Amazon, which I love. Makes this great, and I mean great microphone even better. I have done side by side comparisons to the Neumann U87, the Sennhieser D421, the Lawson L47, all top notch and very expensive studio mics. The Yeti sounds as good. Of course you have to learn how to work a microphone properly to get the right sound. I cringe at some YouTube demos of this mic, some of the folks are not using this, and I'm sure other mike's correctly to get the best sound. Also the more I use the Yeti, the more seasoned it becomes, in comparison recordings done a year ago, the Yeti seems to get a smoother sound, as time goes by."

3109436,B001OQCV1K,A dud..,"Based on the book by Jodi Picoult, My Sister's Keeper tells the story of a family on the brink of ruin. While sister Kate sits in the hospital preparing to die from her last battle with leukemia, her younger sister Andromeda is suing their parents for the fight to make her own decisions on her body. The back story: When Kate was under five years old, she was diagnosed with leukemia and there was no match for blood transfusions or organ donations. Therefore, Kate's mother and father decided to have a daughter who genetically matched Kate from whom the parents could harvest her organs and blood to ensure that Kate lived. This worked perfectly for about 11-12 years until Andromeda (the created daughter) decided that she wanted control over her own body and did not want to be subjected to tests and harvests. Of course this threw the entire family into shock and divided all members. If you are a reader of Jodi Picoult, you know that there is a twist to every story. However, this twist is not nearly as powerful on screen as it was on the page. Yet, that seems to be the motto for this film: read the book instead!!In fact, there is little in common between the film and the book. Though the names are the same and the fact that one daughter sues the family for her medical rights is also the same, little else is. In this novel, there are in fact two twists that occur. Yet, the movie only showed one and the more boring one at that. If you have read the book, you would be outraged at the happy ending that the movie presents. In addition, the characters in the film are presented with much more heart and compassion than the cut-throat mom and extremely distant father in the novel. It seems as if none of the cast and crew even read the book. Instead, you would probably find dozens of copies of the novel being used as doorstops throughout the studio. Ironically, it is the movie that should find an alternative use. Overall...another dud!"
1853718,B00004STN3,classic,"Quincy Jones had been composing soundtracks for years when this album came out in 1969. These were jazz scores, and created a symphonic big band blues that was fat and lucious.He takes the same ideas and applies them, here, to the title track, and other standards such as ""Dead End"" and ""Killer Joe.""The arrangements here are big and spacious, with plenty of top calabre soloing by some of the best jazz pros available at the time. Jones litterally transforms his chosen materal from rock and soundtrack pieces to amazing jazz vehicles. This is pretty conventinal big band jazz, but Jones' selection and arrangements are so big, yet so fluid, the music is rich and grand. He has always been a master at tone color and texture, and this is exploited to the hilt on Walking In Space.The audio here has a eccho, as if you are listening to a big band in a theatre or dancehall. During a solo, the other horns are always mixed back, so you actually get the depth of a big soundstage. This lends itself perfectly to the nuance Quincy so beatifully creates.On a good stereo, you can litterally hear the instruments reverberating off your walls. (Audiophiles dream of albums like this, and if you are into tubes and have a big listening space, you have to buy this for the sound quality alone.) Great musicians don't do anything by chance on records, and on Walking In Space, the master has executed his plan perfectly."
1516469,B009K6YJTS,The  reason why to avoid pre-orders,"I am sure that most people like me,  pre-ordered the game after watching so many previews and it sure looked good at the time....but wow, what a dissapointment. I pre-ordered  the game at green man gaming with the usual 25- 30% off codes they offer so i decided to pick the game up, big mistake! first thing you will notice is how outdated the graphics are. Another thing is that this game  feels soooo old school but in such a bad way, the enemy AI is a joke, there really is no scare factor in this game, you can run in a straight line and kill any alien at will without worrying about the acid blood it leaves behind, the game has its glitches like doors not opening and aliens & marines getting stuck on walls. The multiplayer is ok....i like playing it instead of the campaign. Overall this game should be avoided, there is a controversy with the developers and sega with why this game ended up so differently from the previews and demo. This is just unacceptable, thanks to this game, i will not pre-order ever again!!!Edit- 8/8/2013the game has received plenty of patches which fixes glitches  and really improves the graphics, i still do not recommend getting this game even if you are a huge aliens fan. The DLCis not even worth it and online play is pretty much dead nowadays."
1837970,B000002LB7,Electric Brings the Cult to Light !,"Wow the Cult one of my favorite bands! Where to start? Ian Astbury, and Billy Duffy two amazingly talented and inseperatable musicians. The cult started out as a english underground rock band with punk roots and as they gained popularity Ian it seemed was constently being influenced by the world around him, changing his views and musical direction which apparently Duffy didnt always see eye to eye with but nether the less stuck it out and played his part well. After gaining most of their attention in the goth genre with songs like Santuary, and Here Comes the Rain , Ian again changed course and became infactuated with the American Indian culture and again another album.The Cult came to the attention of American rockers with Electric and especially the song Love Removal Machine. Its my understanding that the popularity of ACDC and their style highly influenced Ian and Duffy to write the songs on Electric , leaving their mostly gothic roots and fans behind and entering into the pure rock genre. After reading this I highly agree, this is indeed a new Cult we were dealing with here. New music new appearance and a growing amount of new fan support, that more than made up for the saddened gothic fans who felt left out on Electric.This is the best Cult album ever and it shows off both Astburys vocals as well as Duffys great guitar work. The only thing missing from Electric are the two songs Fire Woman, and Sun King from Sonic Temple. Fire Woman has one of the most amazing lead guitar works of all time, has anyone else not noticed that Duffy is almost constantly in lead all the way through this song. It belongs on Electric.If you could only have one Cult album besides the Hits which does a great job of covering the Cult discography, Electric is the one to have hands down."

I couldn't use it because the size description on the product was wrong. I checked it for a small size, and it SAID it was much smaller than the 14&#34; my dog needed so ordered the medium. And the medium was much to large for her. The seller required a $5. return postage fee to exchange. That plus what it would cost to return it to them would almost be the price I already paid! To return for refund would cost my postage plus a restocking fee. So beware of buying this product. Check the sizes and compare to make sure they are right.

The Alaskan salmon I would buy again and again but unless someone in Amazon.com can guarantee me that the salmon I receive is made and packaged in Alaska, I will definitely cancel my order immediately. I believe firmly in buying American for a number of reasons and none of them are political ( will most of them anyway)l. More of us, I believe, should think this way in order to produce more jobs in our country and not depend on other countries, and whatever their sanitary conditions dictate which could be very much unlike the FDA standards in America. I also believe that Amazon.com should stipulate where each product is made and not the double talk about "" packaged in Canada"" which could mean purchased in China and then packed in Canada. The only way to improve our country is to rely on Americans to produce products, receive the rewards of their labors and stabilize the economy-now that may be political but it's the damn truth."

After attaching it for the first time, it reduced the pressure to such a low level that there was hardly any water coming through the faucet. I had to remove it to get a decent water flow. Perhaps the shore water pressure is already set at the correct pressure, my camper already has a water pressure reducer built in, but the valve proved useless for me. Wasted my money!"

3742730,B0002SR8AK,Perfect for Ranger pickup,"This tool fits easily behind the headlight area in my 1996 Ranger pickup. The long handle makes it simple and quick to make adjustments. I saw in other reviews that the space in other Ford vehicles is tight, but there's plenty of room in the Ranger.It's not obvious which way to turn the screws for up/down or left/right, so you have to experiment. You just flip the wrench around to turn the other way. Unlike regular ""clicking"" ratchet wrenches, the fine-ratchet capability on this tool makes it easy to do micro-adjusting, and it also makes sure that you can turn the headlight screw even if you have only a short swing on the ratchet handle.(FYI: for the Ranger, the bottom screw is vertical, top screw is horizontal.)A great tool, makes an otherwise crummy job simple."

1816368,B00CHI6SW2,"Very Functional, Sharp Knife","This Coast Lock, Folding knife is built to last and has no play in the blade and closes and opens securely. It has a solid feel and is well made. It's a bit large but I am sure it can cut through rope and just about anything else with ease. It does have a couple of design flaws with some of the little bolts not fully flush with the handle.The only problem I had with the knife, being not that familiar with knifes, is that it had no instruction on how to close it and once I first opened the knife, it stayed that way until I figured out that you just pull aside an inner piece that makes the lock fold back into place. This is an extremely sharp knife on the larger side that can tackle whatever you need to tackle with it. It has a saw type blade with teeth on the bottom of the smooth, razor sharp blade.If you need a sturdy, sharp 4 inch knife, I would recommend the Coast Folding knife for durability, looks and functionality."

Today when took the gun out and the light fell off.  What?  Well, the mounting bracket broke!  Bad material and design, not user errors like some reviewers had indicated.  Google up and you will see many similar cases. Unless Streamlight changed the design or material, this is not going to work as its primary purpose is for home defense.  And when you need it most, it would fly off ... maybe it would hit the target?!!  I also have a TLR-4 with similar design and material and am wondering when it would fall off, too?8/12/2013:  Sent off the light to Streamlight on 8/1/2013; they sent back a replacement today 8/12, but unfortunately it has a broken front lens! The replacement light is not in its original box (used, returned?), but it was very well packed so it cannot be broken during transit.  The crack on the front lens is so obvious and I am not sure how they would miss it, unless a) I was sent a factory reject item or b) Streamlight got rid off their QC department altogether.  I am returning it back again.  Very disappointed and probably never buy any Streamlight product again. Too bad that I currently have a TLR-1, TLR-3, TLR-4 and an 88040 HL all from Streamlight. Humbug."

The episodes with these guys in them are hilarious and the outtakes featuring these characters are even better! The movie in general is a lot of fun, but I'd really like to see a spinoff movie featuring the Utah Law Enforcement Officer characters depicted in this movie! I usually don't enjoy movies with primates in them, but the scene at the restaurant where Jay and Bob are ""mistaken"" for a gay couple and the orangatan is ""mistaken"" for their son is just plain ridiculously funny. Also this DVD comes with the most amazing collection of deleted scenes that I've ever seen. Some of the deleted scenes are better than some of the stuff that wound up staying in the movie. (The actors playing Jay and Silent Bob explain that they had to delete many scenes to keep an R rating. I know it's been said before, but I just don't see why movies can contain incredible amounts of graphic violence, but a few crude jokes can't be tolerated. So much for free speech!)"

Other then that Express yourself(well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid). Like a Prayer is ok, the video and concept are great. But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much, even today. (its like mj with thriller,it gets old quick!)It's really not that great of a song.

3761181,B00AX4TWAM,Brilliant Shine and Superior Protection,"This is an easy to apply wax, which leaves a magnificent shine. Griot's Garage Premium Carnauba Paste Wax results in a smooth, protective finish that feels significantly better than the greenish cream wax that I had been using. I can already see how the carnauba paste will last much longer than the lower-end options available; this wax is firm, yet workable and the finish is absolutely astonishing.The value of the results obtained from the amount that gets used is enough to persuade me to continue using this product in the future. It is worth the extra cost, and I am sure the longevity of the finish will duly reinforce my observations so far. I highly recommend Griot's Garage Premium Carnauba Paste Wax to those who not only desire an impressive shine, but also those who demand reliable protection from the elements - this stuff is great!"
3370193,B005LAII8K,Bruce Gets a Paycheck,"This film is so awful one hardly knows where to start.The central premise - that criminal gangs from the future send their gangland enemies 30 years back in time to be executed by time-traveling assassins - is just beyond stupid. Huh?  Well, apparently, in the future, it's impossible to dispose of murdered bodies, so it's easier to send your live victims back in time to be killed, after you tie them up, put hoods over their heads and wrap them in bars of silver in order to pay the time-traveling assassins.  Uh...yeah, that makes sense.Then add to that a Terminator rip-off subplot where one of the assassins goes back in time to kill a child who has killed his wife 30 years in the future.The screenplay is so bad and the directing so inept that the actors seem to just wander around in a stupor, asking, ""What am I supposed to be doing here?""The cinematography is murky.  The pacing is lethargic.  The editing is beyond incompetent.  Every single character, including the little kids, are so one-dimensional and irritating that I couldn't wait for them to kill each other, but they couldn't even manage to do that.It's lousy science fiction.  It's lousy action.  It's lousy film noir.And perhaps worst of all, Bruce Willis, who I've followed ever since he was the bartender at my local restaurant in Hell's Kitchen, has totally jumped the shark, joining Robert DeNiro among actors whose future films I will avoid."

3263322,B003Z94WBG,"Terrific ""B"" Action Flick","I wasn't terribly impressed with the last Anchor Bay DTV action flick starring former wrestler ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, THE STRANGER, but as I'm always up for some testosterone-fueled cinematic mayhem, I decided to give the latest Austin vehicle, HUNT TO KILL (2010) a spin anyway.I'm glad I did.Austin plays a Border Patrol Agent named Jim Rhodes. After a bitter divorce that leaves him raising his teenage daughter Kim (Marie Avgeropoulis) alone and the brutal murder of his partner (Eric Roberts, picking up a check for a quick cameo), Rhodes accepts a promotion that finds him stationed in Northern Montana. But his quiet life in the woods is upset when a band of ruthless heist artists led by a sociopath named Banks (Gil Bellows, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, LOVE & A .45) roll into the neighborhood with a fortune in stolen bearer bonds. They take his daughter hostage, and coerce him into leading them through the wilderness and over the Canadian border. Of course, it isn't long before there's conflict and falling outs among the crooks, and the opportunity for a little random Rambo-styled mayhem on Stone Cold's part.HUNT TO KILL, despite the blandly generic title and somewhat over-familiar plotline, is a terrific low-budget B-action film. Austin is surprisingly effective in the lead role, exhibiting some unexpected bits of human emotion along with the expected brute force. The cast is better than average for the genre, with Bellows turning in a fine, sly turn as the leader of the crooks, and British martial arts star Gary Daniels (THE EXPENDABLES, BLOODFIST IV) making a formidable physical opponent for the hulking Austin. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA vets Michael Hogan and Donnelly Rhodes appear in brief cameos, while Emilie Ullerup of SyFy's SANCTUARY (and a few GALACTICAs) portrays a sexy, felonious femme fatale.The direction by Keoni Waxman is well-paced and engaging, and he makes good use of his cast and locations. The gorgeous, dangerous Canadian wilderness is captured in all its majesty by cinematographer Tom Harting and the score by Michael Plowman is excellent. The script isn't particularly original, but there are a few good twists, a couple of interesting characters, some intentional humor, and plenty of action set-pieces.The stuntwork is excellent, and the action is extremely well-shot and edited. The standout scene is the inevitable throw-down between Austin and Daniels, and when it finally occurs, it proves to be worth the wait. The fight is well-staged and clearly photographed, without the now-passe shaky camerawork, rapid editing and MATRIX-y computer crap that is usually employed to obscure bad choreography. No, this is a duel of mock-combat titans and truly a joy to behold.Anchor Bay's DVD of HUNT TO KILL sports a pristine, razor-sharp 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer and a very robust Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The only bonus features are an audio commentary by director Keoni Waxman and actor Michael Eklund, a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, and a trailer.HUNT TO KILL isn't an action classic, but it's a damned good manly entertainment, with plenty of thrills, spills and a couple of big explosions. Fans of B-action flicks should definitely give it a spin. Recommended."

1298659,B000KIRT6A,review of Behringer EQ 700 pedal,"Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. I just didn't want to spend $100 on the Boss version, but you get what you pay for! Another thing that I hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the Boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. I also bought a Behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out."

3752786,B001GJ3E2K,"Good brush, depending on your wheels","I find this brush adequate to keep the wheels on my car clean, although whether or not you will depends on how much space you have between the ""spokes"" on your wheels. In my case, I can just work the brush between the sections of my Porsche's wheels, letting me thoroughly clean the face and back of the wheel, as well as the hubs and those lovely yellow calipers. On other cars, there's not adequate space to do this, and then you might prefer to go with a smaller wheel.Otherwise, the brush works well. It's soft and metal-free so as to not scratch anything, no matter what you hit it into. It rinses easily and seems to hold up to lots of heavy use.Recommended, if it fits your wheels."

2621462,B00008972B,At least they seemed to be amusing themselves.,"I get a kick out of seeing people fall down, crash on skateboards and bikes, etc. so it would seem that I would like this movie. While watching it I didn't find any of the stunts funny. The only time I even cracked a smile was when ""Wee-Man"" walked around Tokyo hidden under a giant traffic cone.For one I thought there was a lot of Candid Camera/Tom Green rip off filler (shoplifting old guy, alligator in the kitchen, etc.) that was not funny in the least. The rest of the stunts were, in my opinion, not that outrageous. I felt that the ""actors"" were excessively exaggerating the pain/discomfort that there actions caused in order to make a better movie.I felt ripped off watching this movie after checking it out from the library for free. Charging people to see it in a theater seems almost criminal to me."

1769357,B002HQNC6E,It won't last. Needs a better switch engagement mechanism.,"Got the reconditioned multimax for about $50 approximately a year ago. Only used it a few times for light cutting jobs like cutting a piece of cedar siding off of a house. It was apparent early on this tool is underpowered, but it cut fine as long as I went slowly and let the blade do the work. But occasionally it would cut out--it would just stop working. If I shake the tool it would start again. Maybe a bad connection? Or is it overheating? If the latter then this tool is way too underpowered. Today I got about 1 inch into a cut of a piece of plywood (going very slowly) and it stopped working and won't start up even with the shaking. Likely it will start again when it cools off and I shake it, but I have given up on it. When it it works, the tool is great--it can do things and get to places other tools can't easily. Of course, the one year warranty expired last month. I should have sent it back months ago. I will buy a different brand next time.I just took it apart to see if I could find anything wrong with it. There were no obvious burned out components or loose connections. I used my multimeter to check the coils on the rotor and the stator and they seemed fine. The brushes were also fine. There was no dust or other debris inside. So then I focused on the switch. I tested the switch with my meter and it also appeared to be fine (pushed button and measured continuity between the two leads). But the design of the mechanism that engages the switch is terrible. As you slide the switch button on the top of the machine, a flimsy plastic piece slides forward and somehow depresses the tiny button on the actual electrical switch inside the machine. The motion of the plastic beam is 90 degrees to the direction the switch must be depressed! That is, instead of pushing down on the button switch, it slides laterally across it.  This can only possibly work if the switch is held down in the correct position and the plastic beam doesn't bend and there is the perfect amount of space for that beam to move. They attempt to do this with another vertical plastic beam sticking down from the housing which pushes down on the switch. My multi max won't turn on without a shake and then turns itself off after a few seconds (without even cutting anything), and then won't turn on without a shake (sometimes). It won't stay on for more than a few seconds. (It did this before I took it apart and put it back together).It doesn't seem like an overheating problem. This is an electrical connection problem. I think it is the poor design of that switch engagement mechanism and not the switch itself. I am going to do what one other poster said--I am going to buy a cheap toggle or pushbutton switch and replace their switch. Dremel needs to hire some new engineers--can't blame this on the Chinese manufacturers--this is an engineering design problem.Update: I soldered on a toggle switch and it works!Update2: It doesn't work again. The toggle switch is fine. There is apparently some other intermittent connection problem. I give up.Update3: I bought a BoschBosch MX25EC-21 2.5-Amp Multi-X Oscillating Tool Kit. It works great and has already seen heavy use--it just seems to be made of sturdier stuff (and is considerably heavier). Don't gamble with a Dremel."
2292765,6304195397,The Worst Movie I've Ever Watched,"I've been told on many occasions that Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song was one of the most groundbreaking, revolutionary films during the blaxploitation era.  I've also read that it was one of the most important black films of all time.  Hey, it came out long before I was born, so I had no idea what these people were talking about.  I had to see it for myself.While all three points are neglibile, this movie is horrible.There's hardly any dialouge, the main character lacks any kind of depth.  In fact, the main character says only a few words in the entire film.  The movie consists of him running ""from the man,"" overpowering ""the man,"" and f****** himself out of every situation.  The only thing he's got going for him is having some ""sweetback.""  As a man, I found the notion that he can f*** his way out of his problems disgusting and unrealistic.  I'm not saying this as some kind of moralist.  I love reading and writing noir fiction.  I love cheesy movies and even cheesier noir, but I hate this movie.  If that wasn't enough, the psychadelic cinematography was blurry, grainy and shaky.  In fact, 2/3 rds of the movie consists of unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the movie.The only thing I can agree with is that this film was the most important indie film of all time.  Not black, because its bigger than being a black film.  My reason?  Because without Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song making money, none of the much better indie films get made over the past 40+ years, regardless of genre.Anyone who knows me knows that in order for me to assign anything one-star, its got to be very, very, very, very bad."
1750740,B0013Q0S4S,Bad joke,"Just purchased a house. The seller's realtor bought us two of these. Easy to program. Works great ... inside the garage. Once I'm outside, forget it, and we have NO driveway, just an alley with maybe 8' of concrete leading into the garage. I got so frustrated this morning I threw the thing out the window. Piece of junk. I thought maybe it's just a weak battery, so I took the second one and programmed it. Easy to do, and inside the garage it works every time. Outside, once every 10-20 tries. Are you serious? I have a garage door opener that requires me to go back inside the garage, hit the wall switch, and run back outside as the door closes, jumping over the light beam to make sure I don't reverse it. Really? Universal pain in the butt is what this thing is."

I bought these with little hope that they would help.  They felt a bit awkward at first in my shoe because of their shape but within about two weeks the pain was completely gone.  I had done stretches also to help with the pain and it may just be a coincidence that it healed within the same time that I purchased these but I would buy these again in a heartbeat!

1811646,B009NALKV6,"Does the job, but the app is lacking","This device does exactly what is advertised, but I feel the app is far too limited.  There are plenty of laser measurers on the market that are simple and easy to use and only cost about $100.  If I'm going to take the time to get my phone, remove it from the case, and plug it into this device, I would expect that the app would give me more features.  For example, if I was trying to figure out the square footage of a room, why doesn't the app do the calculation for me and step me through the process? Features like that would make it worthwhile.  If they upgrade the app then this device might be worth it, otherwise spend your money on a measuring device that is dedicated to that task."

1722422,B000COHC3M,RC frequency remote vs IR frequency remote,"I went from a Ritetemp with an infrared remote(same as tv,dvd,etc remotes), pretty much a  line of site remote. It worked kinda, if I got up and pointed it at the thermostat from a foot or two away, again almost a definite line of site remote, which totally defeated my purpose of not having to get up to change the thermostat. This Lux has a radio controlled remote. It ROCKS! It would probably work from out on my patio. Cons? If it had a 1/2 degree temp setting on the temp turn on/off, it couldn`t get much better than that. Another buyer on Amazon mentioned it eating batteries. Mine is too new to know, but that would be a fair trade off for the convienence of this remote, for me. I never ever use dollar store batteries. And rechargeable batteries are usually only about 1.3 volts I think, vs 1.5 volts from an alkaline battery. I highly recomend this unit. ps, I ""think"" you can use up to 3 remotes one thermostat?"

I use Slim-Fast to wash down a handful of vitamins, not because I'm hungry.The price when I bought it from Amazon was about $1.15 cheaper than Walmart's price with tax ($9.61).  Now it's almost the same with the subscribe and save option.I am not pleased with the decreased content volume at the same price as the old cans.I tried to save money by switching to the Costco version of Slim-fastKirkland Signature Weight Loss Shake, Milk Chocolate Flavor, 24-pack 11-fl.

1372633,B000FQ2D5E,Worth it for MGO alone.,"Metal Gear Solid taught me all about ""hyping"". Up until the days I played PSX I used to go to my local videostore as a child and rent videogames with my mom. At that age  my choices were based on how cool the cover art looked for the title or if it was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cartridge. When I picked up that issue of Gamepro back in 97' and saw what this little known stealth game Metal Gear Solid was turning into it became almost an addiction to research upcoming killer apps, wherever I could find the info. Now by todays standards it seems to be the norm to find hype every where you turn for games like Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots or GTA IV. Guns of the patriots is a must have for any GAMER or metal gear fan alike. The action sequences are varied and can carry over much replay value. The story is a bit convoluted yet doesn't hamper the gameplay one bit. The online feauture; Metal Gear Online is worth the price of admission alone and continues to be updated to this DAY! Just expect to pay for the major add-ons in MGO. I want to keep this short so I can go back to playing the game but if your just starting out in the PS3 game Metal Gear is entry level yet hardcore for any gamer."

Now, that may very well be, but I ask you:  who wants their chocolate chip cookies to taste like dry, low cal cereal bars?  Not me, that's for sure!It is possible that the packaging and shipment may have contributed to the disastrous taste and texture of these CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies.  These cookies were shipped to me, cross country in 100 degree weather.  They sat in my broiling mailbox for most of the afternoon.  But, come on, if you are going to offer a product that you ship nationwide or worldwide, then it needs to be able to  stand up to any and all possible conditions.  Hey, Nabisco, you need to seriously rethink this product.  NOT RECOMMENDED."

1767759,B002CJLUXI,It's a $99 saw what else do you expect??,"My expectations were not high. I knew it wasn't a expensive saw nor did I think it would perform like one. I just needed it to cut some small pieces of plywood for a photography project I'm working on. What I didn't expect was a missing bolt for the blade guard and a motor sounding like metal on metal grinding. Unfortunately, I returned the whole thing. I'm not going to throw away my money. The saw seemed like it would do the intended job. It's definitely not a contractor saw nor should it be compared. If you have the occasional piece of wood or small project it would probably work. It's not a precision tool by any means. Wish I could of put it to the test. Fortunately, Amazon has a easy return policy. On to plan B!!!"

1301028,B002GYWBKU,Express MkII and POD HD Desktop.. don't bother,"Before I purchased the FBV I scoured the web to see how it works with the POD HD Desktop, and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking..Anyway, I lucked out and found a used one going cheap, and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the POD HD desktop & FBV Express II combo.1. First, in the setup screen do NOT enable the FBV Express. Yes, I know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. Read the FBV Express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d/l the FBV software for this.Now.. In the POD setup screens you have the option to either have the ABCD buttons as ABCD, or to be FS5-FS8. This behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the FBV.So.. In ABCD mode you can:a) Select preset A, B, C or D from the group you are currently in.b) Insert a volume FX and use volume pedal...EXP2c) Insert another FX enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as EXP1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but CANNOT enable it.3/10/14 EDIT :Looper control is flawed. You can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugNice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching FX blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns OD on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching).. YAY!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a NO to ABCD and mode FS5-FS8 it is for me!..SO yup in FS5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay FB etc)c) basic control of looper BUT cannot enable itEDIT 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?...oh sod it. nope you can'td) tap tempo?.. nope not that either.So in summary, the Express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop.. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod.. get the HD500x instead."

1513880,B008SBZD82,WOST APPEARING LIGHTCORE FIGURE AVAILABLE!  WAIT FOR SERIES 2 VERSION,"Drobot is a great character to play with. He flys eventually, and can shoot lasers from his eyes. His attack has more of a wide ranged span that can wipe out alot of enemies. If have purchased Skylander's Spyro's Adventure and played it with Drobot in the past there isn't a whole lot different from this one. But if you are buying the GIANTS version of the reposes for the ability to switch upgrade paths back and forth.. DON'T BUY THIS ONE!! Only the reposes, or Series 2 figures of the original game characters have that ability. LIGHTCORES CAN'T SWITCH UPGRADE PATHS! ONCE YOU MAKE A CHOICE YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT OR RESET THE FIGURE AND LOOSE ALL THE GAME PLAYING EXPERIENCE ON IT.EXPALIN LIGHTCORE:Each element has one Lightcore figure available and Drobot is from the TECH element. All lightcore figures ""Light up"" somewhere.. Prisim Break is the best I've seen yet and his crystals glow green when put on the portal. I now have Jet Vac and Shroomboom in Lightcore also. Jet Vac looks pretty cool too. He lights up with a blue dot on his chest plate and his air gun lights up blue in a tunneling effect. Shroomboom's eye lights up a little bit, but his green transparent mushroom at his side lights up brighter in green than his eye does. Drobot is the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT when it comes to a Lightcore figure! He has a small gold round circle on his back that lights up...That's it..No Glowing Eyes..Nothing! You can't even see his ""special light up ability"" from a distance while playing. Lightcore figures have a special ability that the Series 2 versions don't have..they wipe out close surrounding targets, for about 1 second, when initially put on the portal. That is what you will have with this figure which retails for $2.00 more than the Series 2 version that will be coming soon. There will be a Series 2 Drobot released during another wave that will have a slightly different pose and not be Lightcore. This repose will have the ability to switch between upgrade paths (Master Blaster or Clockwork Dragon) at any time throughout the game. This figure will also have the ""Wow Pow"" upgrade called ""Supreme Bladegear"" (it combines bladegears into one controllable super bladegear) available that this Lightcore version doesn't have.If you are on a budget, save your $2.00 difference for the Series 2 Drobot or buy the Spyro's version on sale!

1327331,B00005QB9N,Complete Thrill Ride!,"I bought Ghost Recon not too long ago. I've heard it was pretty good and I have always loved the Rainbow Six series. So I'd thought I'd try this game out. I ripped open the box right when I got home and when I inserted the cd in my pentium 4 processor I was simply amazed! Ghost Recon is a complete edge of your seat thrill ride! Most people say that their version run on their computer. Well, this game ran on my 1.3GHz Pentium 4 Processor just fine, and to top it off I have an extremely fast cable modem hooked up for those sweet multiplayer games! Anyway, I'll start off by telling you why Ghost Recon is like no other game.First, I'll start out with the awesome single-player missions. When you load up your game you'll start off in your first mission. You're a Ghost (The Ghosts are a US military team that are always first in line with the latest weapons, training, and technology.) and have to lead your squads to victory. You will choose six soldiers to support you in these daring missions. You can choose from Riflemen, Support Soldiers, Demolination Specialists, and of course, Snipers that can cloak easily if crouching beside trees, bushes, and other certain objects. Each soldier you choose will affect your mission. Some are best in leadership, others are best in heavy assault weapons to shoot down enemies quickly and forcefully. Each soldier also carries two weapons or items. You can choose their kits to make your mission a little more balanced out. Picking your soldiers carefully is extremely important in your missions. If you pick one wrong soldier then you may not make it out alive. After you choose your soldiers carefully, then you're ready to step behind enemy lines and drop the hammer.You can easily command your squads using the command map. You can tell your soldiers where to hide, attack, etc. You can be on one side of an enemy's base, while the other side is being ambushed. The command map is an extremely useful item in the game, especially if you want to storm a base. You can divide your soldiers into three different squads. The squads are Alpha Team, Bravo Team, and Charlie Team. It's best to have different squads if you need to advance an enemy attack.Ghost Recon is a very realistic game. The AI is just simply amazing itself. Your enemies are smart and you're going to have to out smart them with your squads right behind your back to cover you. You'll have to do all crazy kinds of tasks just to succeed, which I think is truly awesome! You can shoot the enemy and they'll be dead or wounded depending where they hit you. I mostly go for the head so they're dead right away. However, if you shoot an enemy soldier, or if they fire at you, other enemies may hear the gunshots and form a huge squad of their own to bring you down. So it's important on which soldier you take out first. Like I said, Ghost Recon is a very realistic game, there is no health which is a pretty cool thing because it's just like being in a real combat situation. If you get shot you'll be dead or wounded depending on where you got shot. The maximum times to get shot is two times so you have to be very careful and thing of insane stratistic moves to outsmart your enemies.There are many different enemies, vehicles, and weapons throughout the game. You'll have to blow up enemy tanks with your anti-tank rocket launcher, shoot down hard-to-find enemy soldiers with your sniper, and free innocent hostages and civilians just to succeed.Well, I don't want to ruin everything for your experience in single-player, so I'll move onto the exciting multi-player games.Multi-player is a lot better than single-player in my opinion. Up to 36 players can join games to take the fun rating to an absolute thrill ride. You can start playing multi-player by going to the Ghost Recon main menu and clicking on multiplayer. However, I do this a whole different way. I use Gamespy Arcade to find a lot more servers and games to join. Gamespy Arcade is a free program that let's you find hundreds of more servers and games that are being played on Ghost Recon right now. You can easily chat with other players, or you can simply join or create a clan. You can see a game's total ping on Gamespy Arcade and what type of game it is. In other words, Gamespy Arcade let's you find hundreds or yet thousands of more servers, games, and hardcore gamers just like you. If you're new to the multiplayer gaming world then get Gamespy Arcade.Multiplayer is a lot better than single-player. You can have tournaments, win cool prizes, and make some cool friends. Plus, the maps are bigger, better, more obstacles, etc., and to top it off there are many different gameplay modes! Gameplay modes consist of Hamburger Hill (never played that yet), Last Man Standing (you have to be the last man standing), sharpshooter (intelligent mode where you have to win with your sharp-shooting skills), Recon, Co-Op Missions (You can play the single player missions with other people!), and a heck of a lot more! I suggest you have a really good connection though to have fun in the multiplayer world. That means that you should have a cable modem or a higher connection for faster games. If you play on a 56k modem chances are it'll take a long time to even fire a single bullet. To make your multiplayer experience more enjoyable, I suggest you create or join a really good clan. Clans are groups of people that try to be the best of the best by destroying other clans just to make it to the top. You'll be expected to participate in tournaments (some tournaments give out prizes such as free 80 GB hard drives if you're just in first place). You can form a peace treaty with other clans to help you stay alive on the battlefield, you'll also come upon rivals and enemies trying to squash your clan. Joining or creating a clan is a whole new experience in multiplayer gaming because you'll have allies, enemies, backstabbers, rivals, etc. Well, this about wraps up the multiplayer mode in Ghost recon.Ghost Recon is a complete joyride involving many different strategies to overcome. This is such a realistic game that it actaully feels like you're in a real combat situation. If you want a game that let's you form new strategies to stomp your enemies, sharp eye-popping graphics, complete overwhelming storyline, awesome multiplayer world, supperior AI that you'll have to outsmart and shoot down quickly, and sweet hot sizziling gameplay that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then I say buy Ghost Recon!"

Gabriel Byrne, in his best role  ever, plays Tommy, the right hand man to Leo(Albert Finney, who's  terrific), the Irish head of organized crime in an unnamed city in the  1920's-1930's.  He finds himself caught between Leo and the head of an  Italian crime gang, Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, in a gang war over  turf and a fight hustler named Bernie &quot;the Shmatta&quot; Bernbaum,  played by John Turturro.  To reveal more would be a crime in itself.  Catch  director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead 2, Darkman, A Simple Plan) playing a trigger  happy cop on a raid.

1463357,B003O6HLOK,"Unique experience, cliffhanger ending.","The game is basically Dragon Ball Z on steroids. The ground combat and rail-shooter segments are generally well polished, fun, and fairly easy unless you're going for some of the more difficult achievements. I found myself getting really invested in the story. The game is QTE heavy and its probably the best implementation of QTE based gameplay I've ever seen.With that said, the game is short. A single playthrough will probably only take you 3-5 hours. The worst thing about the game is that the ""true ending"" is a cliff-hanger to get the DLC which has the real ending. So, if you want the full game experience, you're going to be dropping another $7 on top of the sticker price. It's a pretty sleazy move, but, I'd expect no better from Capcon and I feel really bad for the people who paid full price for this."

These bars are not bad at all.  So many others I have looked at have hidden artificial sweeteners (like aspartame) in them, but not these, only 8 grams of sugar per bar (our household limit is 9 grams per serving of any food) and there is a tiny bit of stevia, but I have no problem with that since I am a big stevia believer.  These have only 130 calories so it can be a snack (if a protein bar gets to be too high in calories it really ought to be a meal replacement) and these are chocolatey enough to satisfy my chocolate craving.  These have 3 grams of fiber, not so much, but then these are not trying to be fiber bars.  These bars have 9 grams of protein, not bad, but it appears to be all soy based, but since it is not SO much protein I guess that is fine (too much soy is not good).  There is some palm oil which I am not a fan of (not ecologically sound and it is cholesterol raising), but few processed foods out there are perfect.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a little something sweet and chocolatey that is low enough in calories to be a snack and who isn't so hung up on natural/organic foods.  From what I've seen in the conventional food isles these are quite clean and they taste good.  While I say that I recommend them, for me personally I will still go back to buying my old standby in the natural foods department, NuGo Slim."

3736559,B00CJ810XM,A healthy treat my dog won't eat,"My dog is a 65lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies as well as the occasional bout with upset stomach. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new dog snacks as a large majority of popular brands are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new brand so here are my thoughts on No Grainers by Nootie Soft Chews for Dogs, 16-Ounce, Hickory Bacon Flavor;Pros+ Completely grain free with no soy, corn or wheat ingredients.+ Excellent size for training.+ Soft and chewy, great for older dogs.+ Made in the U.S.A.Cons- Expensive.  List price of $16.99 for a 16oz. bag would be spendy on a regular basis with a larger dog.- Dog refuses to eat them for whatever reason, argh!I really wanted my dog to enjoy No Grainers by Nootie Soft Chews for Dogs, 16-Ounce, Hickory Bacon Flavor but his finicky taste buds just didn't agree.  Overall these treats are quite healthy compared to many others on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these bites combined with the fact my dog won't even eat them prevents me from purchasing them on a regular basis.  Still, you could do much much worse as far as treats go so I give them a paws up even if my dog doesn't."

1977749,0790729652,Burton's Batman,"The journey of the Dark Knight from comic book to screen saw director Tim Burton ditch the campy 60s ""KAPOW!"" action and outrageous villians and go much deeper and darker. The auter who gave the world Beetlejuice (1988) again does things very different. But it works very well. This is still the best in the series, with all the key players working to their very best. Michael Keaton IS Batman, evoking the same troubled character from the DC comics, and of course, Jack Nicholson as The Joker, a great character played brilliantly. Burton, master of the bizzare, was the perfect man to bring the legendary comic book to the screen, and he does it wonderfully. Danny Elfman's excellent score is another added plus, and the action, while not Burton's strong point, is expertley done. The look of Gotham City is inventive and fascinating, creating a nuance of comic book-styled-action and dark storytelling. All this blends perfectly to create one of the best comic book movies of all time."

The description I heard every time the film was mentioned covers about five minutes of actual screen time and completely ignores the complexity of the characetrs involved. Cronenberg comes up with another winner-- excellent script, good pacing, and the kind of cast most hollywood-blockbuster directors dream of being able to assemble, including an (as usual) Oscar-worthy performance from Elias Koteas as Vaughan, thesociopathic leader of the band of fetishists. Definitely one worth seeing; on a par with Cronenberg's best work. ****"

1674908,B00AY6S2KU,Yuck! Thin as dishwater coffee,"Just ordered some of this, the chocolate flavor. Terrible disappointment. I understand they 're-formulated' this gruel, which apparently means they watered it down to make more money on what may have previously been a tasteful and worthwhile product.  This stuff is thinner than skim milk, but unfortunately with not as much taste -- unless you count the unpleasant powdery aftertaste.  I'm recovering from some pretty major surgery and had hoped it would be a good boost of the protein I need for healing and suitable alternative to the 'Boost' manufactured by the inhumane Nestle Corp. food-like product engineers.  It isn't.  Probably too much trouble to send it back, so maybe I'll just put some real, organic chocolate syrup in it and try to choke down the remaining 11 containers I'm stuck with."

1884862,B00AG6Z5U8,Jim James' First Solo Outing Searches Through The Soul,"The first time I heard Jim James was as a guest vocalist on the song ""Progress"" on the Booker T Jones albumThe Road From Memphisa couple years back. During that time I'd been hearing a lot about My Morning Jacket and their intense,expansive take on psychedelic southern rock. They were in all the music magazines I was seeing in the home,they were even very successful on the charts. Still I hadn't (and still haven't) heart any of their music. I am not longer a major radio listener,even on the indie and collage level. Most of my musical journey's come word of mouth and by picking up records. Somehow or other when I heard a few weeks ago that the bands charismatic,red haired and bearded leader Jim James was releasing his first solo album I became very excited. Sometimes in playing with a band,you have to give up a lot of your own personality for the sake of a musical democracy. James,a singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire,more than has what it takes to deliver on a solo practice after so many years with a band who earned much deserved success. What he says here on his own,musically is quite another matter.The album opens up with a trio of songs in ""State Of The Art (AEIOU)"",""Know Til Now"",with it's compelling delayed rhythm intro and ""Dear One"". Musically these combine a spare,echo drenched sound-full of piano and with a strong funky soul groove that is bought to life even more by the spare and delicate psychedelic arrangements. ""A New Life"" is a beautifully expansive melody-right out of the reverb heavy Roy Orbison school of highly melodic pop/rock that James brings his own soaring,mildly ragged multi octave vocals to.  ""Exploding"" is a rather like minded instrumental done on acoustic guitar. ""Of The Mother Again"" and ""Actress"" are two of my favorite songs here (if I was asked to pick just two) mainly because they bring out the sweetly orchestrated blue eyed soul/pop that was so prevalent in the late 60's/early 70's with their melodic keyboard solos and enticing rhythms.  The last two songs are musically very much night and day of the same attitude-both are built of James harmonizing beautifully with his own multi tracked voice to the pretty and haunting melodies but ""All Is Forgiven"" is a bit downbeat and searching where ""God's Love To Deliver"" is full of the wealth of love and spirit.There's a quality about this album that reminds me somewhat of Todd Rundgren's 1981 releaseHealingas well as Stevie Wonder'sFulfillingness' First Finale. Both albums were inspired by near soul destroying tragedies and near death experiences,and so is this. In James case,it was falling off the stage at a My Morning Jacket concert. During his apparently difficult recuperation a friend lent him a copy of a 1929 graphic novel calledGods' Manthat apparently helped him seek some kind of redemption between spirituality and his own existence. I can only imagine how much of himself the apparently thoughtful James put into creating this album which,in a lot of ways in nothing short of a masterpiece. By seamlessly blending psychedelia,pop,rock,blues,soul and funk into a strikingly atmospheric musical experience,Jim James was able to play and sing about emotionally complex matters of the soul. He was influenced by many great confessional singer/songwriters of the past obviously,but within the context of his own musical vision. That's the quality that results in this being my personal candidate for best album of the year so far."
265682,B000NIG65C,two years later...,"I bought this 2 years ago and did not use it very much.  I never liked it too much due to the way the button works on the end - it's a little hard to press, and has no feedback.I went to use it yesterday, and it was dead.  Maybe the battery, but I don't know if it's worth replacing.  So, I found an old, basic B-D digital thermometer that this ""replaced"", which was several years old when I got this one.  The B-D thermometer still worked, even though both are similar LCD readouts with similar features.Also, it says it comes with a replaceable Lithium Ion battery.  However, every other site's ad says it's an LR41 NiMH battery.  It would be helpful if they specified the battery here, in case someone wanted to waste time replacing it."
1452362,B002ZJPYHS,Not what was seeable online when ordered,"As you can see by the picture accompanying this review it just says Medal of HONOR, nothing else. When I got it I could see added below that the dreaded 'Limited Edition'. Not once was that stated in the picture or any where in the online description of the product. That sucks. On what I got those words, 'Limited Edition', are in brighter lettering and almost the same size as 'Medal Of' and it's right below 'HONOR'. Now I can see that in the picture there is something there but it could just be the shadow parts of the picture it self. It's just a way to get you hooked to play online only. Also they push Battlefield 3 which is not what I wanted, never did like those games too over view out of touch and bad graphics.I'll play it and hope for the best which may not be worth the time."

3744194,B0007LEG2K,Code Reader,"This Actron CP9125 is an invaluable tool in that it allows you to clear the CEL (check engine light) without having to disconnect the battery and risk possibly causing another problem.  If, for example, your gas cap is left loose and the CEL comes on, you can immediately reset the CEL rather than panic and go to the stealership.  But most people don't realize the OBD-II (on-board diagnostics) will actually self reset after a number of cycles, but few people understand the testing cycle process."
394844,B003H3G470,terrible,"First off, I had every expectation of this being painful.  I know that removing hair from the root would hurt, and I expected nothing less.  That being said... this is horrifically painful!  So much more than waxing!  Maybe I had a defective product, or maybe my hair is unusually tough, but I felt as if this was ripping my skin apart.  I suppose it would be worth the pain if it actually removed all the hair.  After a good 7-10 passes over a sparse patch of hair it did not remove it all!  Don't be fooled into thinking that it removed most hair on the first pass either.  It only grabbed a few hairs at a time, which lead me to believe that what I was feeling was the tweezers pinching my skin and not plucking the hair.  Nothing is more important than looking good, believe me... so if this worked I would certainly endure the pain.  I sent this torture device  back to the seller, and I sure hope I get my money back.  Stick with tweezing, shaving, and waxing."
1334336,B00006AALC,Mesmerizing,"Ordinarily, I'm a hard-core simulation and strategy gamer, with a bent towards city-building. I haven't played an adventure game since ""Black Dhalia"" or ""Myst."" I'd forgotten just how good the genre can be when done well. Syberia reminded me. I picked it up on a whim, and I know I won't be able to quit until I've finished the story.First of all, the graphics are stunning. There's no other way to describe the quality and detail. Here, they raise the bar for adventure games to follow, and raise the genre to the level of art. It's obvious a great deal of care and thought went into this game in that aspect. The only real complaint is that there's no 360 degree view, and no angle variations on any scenes. But the quality of the graphics and the ease of navigation make up for it. Even a user who is not all that familiar with adventure games will be able to pick this one up and run with it in no time at all.The puzzles are hard enough to be challenging, but not so difficult as to be impossible to figure out without hints or a walkthrough. I have resorted to hints only a few times, and it only confirmed that I would have been right to follow my instincts. Also, they are not at all abstract, but each is tied into the story and setting of the game, so they make even more sense if you think about it. Sometimes just wandering around will be enough to lead you to solve the puzzles presented.  Other times, the answer is simpler than you might think. But if you're an experienced adventure gamer you won't have much trouble with them.The real pleasure here is the story and the character development. Your interactions with certain characters is crucial to how well and how quickly your progress in the game. in a sense you have a hand in creating your own unique version of the story. The cell phone is employed as a means of fleshing out the life of the main character outside the story, and serves to create some dramatic tension, though the resolution is somewhat expected.The only other drawback might be the lenght of time it takes the character to get from one point to another (there doesn't seem to be a way to get across Valladilene instantly, for example), but at least the scenery makes the trip seem more worthwhile.  Finally, the only other negative I can think of about this game is that it's too short!  By the end of the game I was left wanting more.  But then I supposed that is the mark of truly good work on the part of the creators.  I understand Syberia II is in the works.  If it's anything like the original, I'll probably be in line to buy it when it's released."

But when I saw the quality, I wear them all the time while riding. I keep the amber and clear in my saddlebags and wear the smoke during the day.

And come on people, can we maybe  stop with the ""anybody who loves music"" will like this s%@*. I happen to LOVE music but not this. It's also insulting to bands like the Shins or New Order to be compared to this. For cool ""warm"" electronic check out Plaid's ""Not for threes"" or for cool catchy music try the Shins, the Strokes, the Pixies, Spoon, early Cure, the Smiths among countless others .

Although heat feels great quite often, the doctor told me that cold compresses can reduce swelling, redness, and pain and I needed to use one.  I decided to try Ace because I have used many of their products and have never had a complaint with any of them.What I love about the Reusable Cold Compress (small):- It is latex free- The material is very soft and non-irritating- It is small and works well on my hands- The instructions are clearly printed on the back of the fabric so I don't have to track down a flyer or the box to remind myself of them- The compress stays flexible when frozenThis compress is only for cold therapy and since I usually use electric heating pads when I want to put heat on an area, it has worked extremely well for me.I recently purchased an Ace Hot and Cold Compress with sleeve in a clearance bin at a local grocery store and will try it in the future.  It has the advantage that it can be used hot or cold, but lacks the ultra-soft cover and instructions on the fabric that the Reusable Cold Compress has.  I do feel better knowing I have a back-up compress on hand if my favorite one is ever damaged."

Problem was, there are a few reputable suppliers, and a lot of supp dealers trying to make a quick buck, with overhyped and under-dosed products. So, Mike developed Legion. Legion has no proprietary blends, doses backed by research, and no fillers or junk.I was purchasing the core ingredients in Recharge and Pulse separately, based on BLS & Muscleforlife.com recommendations, but when I added up the cost - it was cheaper and whole lot easier to buy Legion products. They also taste pretty good and i like drinking my sups more than swallowing a handful of pills. Hope that helps."

If you ask me, DMX's lyrics are weak (especially with his  obsession over the word 'dog'), and his beats are the usual Ruff Ryder  style...WACK.  I don't respect DMX at all and this album was almost as  disgraceful as all the CASH MONEY records.  Trust me, this album is getting  WAY TOO MUCH exposure, and it doesn't deserve it."

About half way through I was very worried by the lack of ""magical hyjinx."" There was no broom riding, magic frog potions, dragons, nothing. Just a few rabbits- and no, they weren't even being pulled out of hats. It turns out Harry was the only one in the family with magic powers after all. I still couldn't turn it off though, the chance that she may pull out a wand and turn a pumpkin into a coach kept my eyes glued to the screen. I was so disappointed when it was over I pulled out my candles, drew a pentagram, and did some magic of my own! So don't be surprised if we are introduced to a bald Renee Zellweger very soon!"

Being taken from a book that is actually lovely and having Meryl Streep as one of the main actors seemed like a good bet for a movie.

2815076,B000AMJG4Y,"Its beautiful, jam-packed with super sonic fight scenes but little else","Just Brings Back MemoriesThe most you'll enjoy this film is having invested a month of your life to the game. Then at best it may stir up old memories, your favourite characters, the fantastic scores of music, and then you'll feel warm inside. Then again, you could always just play the game.The MusicAs with alot of japanese movies they like their electric guitars. So for them to make something old and familiar (the music) sound fresh and more lively they rock it all up with electric guitars which loses its 'fresh' appeal within a minute or two. I'd go with the full blown orchestra every time, with a little less lead guitar pushing all the original music out of the frame. It would have been a welcomed surprize if there was a lead acoutic instrument and harps are always nice.Plot and CharactersBecause of what fans already know, there is little character development. This wouldn't matter so much, apart from the fact that there's very little emotion in the whole film to add to character. No one fears for Clouds life in the final battle, no one sheds one tear of worry. Maybe its becuase they all know who won the fight last time so why bother worry.Becuase of the pace of the story all the characters appear in the film for a fight. The closest you see them all bond is when each character (yup everyone) gives Cloud a foot-boost to chase a Creature that can fly. There's very little dialogue between them. I would have loved for the characters to have human problems the viewer could relate to and then emphasise with but there are none, unless you have a super rear case of geo-stigma.Humour?The only humour element in the whole of the film is acted out by the two Turks in suits. This is screwball tomfoolery comedy at best, hitting each other by mistake etc and nothing more. Its funny the first time. Personally I also thought the turks were the coolest bunch of cats in the whole of FFVII and so I wasn't happy to see these guys turned into Abbot and Castelo, albeit a very cool looking Abbot and Castelo.The Directors VisionThe film was made to appear well... not realIf the creators focused on making a proper movie with real life sensibilities I would have enjoyed the film more. Then again they did say (in the extras) they wanted to make a film that looked like a game not real life. This in turn meant people could jump... (they made their own rules) well you could almost call it flying... all over the place. But then when someone would slip over any edge of some tall structure, about to fall to their demise, the ability to jump/fly is lost and well down they fall.The plot was a message being left for Cloud and him reciveing it at the end of the film (from the directors mouth). Lots of fights are crammed in the middle of the plot. I found the fights far too fast, being as long as they are made for an exhausted viewing.It's pretty.Good Japanese Voices.Average music - typical constant Jap metal guitar solos ruin any faithful representation of the original music.Sorry but there were way too many fan reviews of this DVD, I couldn't find a single one review meriting the film for being exactly that 'a film.' As it is... ""This beautiful film offers no more than skin deep sentimentality for fans of FFVII"" Fans will be happy to own anything that has been branded with the FFVII name. I'm a fan too, but an extreamly picky one at best.Sorry if anyones feelings were hurt, no one else was writing the side of the story but its now here."
1869423,B00065XJ52,"The hunger is gone, as is the heart","Let's see... when Em first hit the scene in the late 1990's, he was the poster boy for the misunderstood, misfit from the other side of the tracks. Creating an alter-ego of Slim Shady, Em cut tracks where no one was safe from being ripped to shreads. Anything and everything was a target to Em, and with his clever, cutting, on the mark lyrics, the music pissed off people, sparked controversy, made him the target of parent groups, climbed quickly up the charts in much cleaner, much friendly radio versions, and created a huge base of fans. Em's star began to shine.In the 2000's, critics kept on beating Em to death. ""He'll never get a grammy, he'll never achieve critical praise."" Wrong again, as he released an album that reached the top of the charts and created an even deeper fan base than before. Then if that wasn't enough, he got that grammy he wanted, when his song ""Lose Yourself"", possibly the strongest song he ever cut, took the award for best soundtrack. Em's talent and popularity were at all time highs.Fast forward to present. Em's controversy is old news. Besides not hearing about who was on his ""hate list"", it is been there, done that. Em isn't a threat anymore. People are used to his antics, and others because it's common place in music now for artists to act like fools. Ja-Rule isn't around anymore, so people don't care if Em has beef with Ja, because where is Ja?Talent? Of course Em has talent. What do you call a chart topping, grammy winning, platnium selling artist? So what happened? Well, the checks came in the mail, Em cashed them, got himself a nice pad, a nice ride, and a nice life. The dream has been achieved, and Em is set for life. The hunger and heart? Gone.So Em decides he has done all he can in his career, and comes up with ""Encore."" This is a decent ride in the sunset, but after one listen, you can't help but know that isn't Em at 100%. He lacks the clever, sharp lyrics and rhymes that made him a legend. This is a half-assed effort, from one of raps biggest legends. This is Em going at it half speed. This is Em saying, ""I've made it, I've done all I can do, time to enjoy the fruits of my hard work.""Em, I congratulate you on a wonderful career. In a quick amount of time, you established yourself among other rap legends such as The Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash, N.W.A., Dr. Dre (Your mentor), A Tribe Called Quest, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., and Publice Enemy. You did it all: you topped the charts, won the awards, and sold the records. It's just too bad that ""Encore"" didn't end with a bang, but more of a putter.The sun is setting, the legend has been sealed, and it's time to enjoy life. You deserve it Em, I wish you all the best in your future endeavors."

Batman: Vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. I really must stress how bad the graphics are. Don't let the color schemes fool you. I've seen better stuff on a Commodore 64."
1883020,B006HH5Z8W,One of 2012's greatest albums so far (strong!! four),"When Interpol made a veritable masterpiece by basically copying late 70's post punk with their 2002 opus Turn On The Bright Lights, hitherto dogmas about originality being fundamentally paramount for the creation of great art went flying out the window. Since then many bands have taken a similarly derivative approach to music making, in the hope that they might recreate the same alchemy evinced on that seminal record. Although some bands have produced noteworthy albums in this vein, nobodies really gotten close to achieving that quasi miracle again (including Interpol) until now that is. Cloud Nothings third album Attack On Memory is the album in question and although it does narrowly fall short, it's gotten about as close as anybodyelse i can think of, in the last ten years.The Cleveland, Ohio band have chosen mid 90's emo/late 80's Post hardcore for their inspirtaion with Attack On Memory and they do it so well here you'd be forgiven for thinking they were one of the original pioneers of this sound, opposed to some shameless twenty something plagarists. If Interpol bought a touch of alt rock and some really dynamicly emotive musicianship to produce their magnum opus, Cloud Nothings have done much the same thing here (using pop opposed to alt rock i should add). No Future/No Past is the intensely foreboding opener to AOM and it's climax is so explosively corporeal you might just smash whatever happens to be near you into a million pieces when it's over. ""Wasted Days"" carries the same energy brought by the NFNP and builds a 9 minute behemoth out of it, something like Rites of spring meets Sonic youth. Listen to it from the 8.05 mark and if you didn't crack on the first track's angsty histrionics you definitely will here.""Fall in"" is the moment where the Sunny Day Real Estate comparisons will come flying in and if it didn't kick some serious ass you might actually care about it's obvious debt. ""Stay Uesless"" is next and it's probably the most beautifully angry pop song to be released this year (sorry Japandroids). The rest of the album slightly goes downhill from this point, even though each song pretty much successfully follows the same hellacious formula of bludgeoning drum rolls, frenzied guitar chords and powerfully screeched vocals, they somehow don't quite feel as life affirmingly transcedent. I do need to highlight the potency of ""No Sentiment"" though, which is as staunchly passionate as any of the best songs on here and the lyrical prowess of Dylan Baldi reaches it's absolute peak by using less than 40 words to convey his razor sharp albeit slightly hypocritical diatribe.You won't be suprised to find Steve Albini's name right next to the producer's credit on AOM, as this album has his no nonsense fingerprints all over it ""Seperation"" almost sounds like a homage to his legendary math rock band Shellac. But even if the the band have benefited from albini's tried and tested recording chops, this album still remains a triumph for Cloud Nothings as they brought the frenetic energy and great songwriting to the table here and the only thing the band should perhaps feel a little plaintive about is that they weren't quite able to produce the classic the first half or even two thirds of this album says they could have (Interpol were seriously running scared for a minute there)."

1527759,B00D41GCUY,Sonic Lost World is a pretty mediocre game.,"I went into this game knowing that it was a slower paced, more platform-focused Sonic game. I've heard people praise this game for its superior level design over the Wii U version, and I've read comments like ""The Wii U version is a mess, but the 3DS one is great!"" It's also pretty much a sequel to Sonic Colors, which is one of my favorite games.Well, I'm here to tell you that it is not a more platforming-oriented Sonic game, and it does not have good level design.What I'm trying to get at is that the game is not a very good game.I'll be completely honest, the first world was incredibly fun. I've read about how Sonic is slow and controls awkwardly, but that really isn't the case at all. Sonic controls smoothly and it feels fluent and satisfying, at least in my opinion, and it's a welcome change that I hope returns for future Sonic games. Unfortunately, though, the game's level design goes downhill as soon as the first boss is completed.So, the game uses ""wisps"", which return from Sonic Colors. In Sonic Colors, they were neat little power-ups that you could use every once in a while, like a drill to dig through the dirt or the laser to shoot through levels. It didn't overstay its welcome enough to earn ""gimmick"" status because the levels only rarely relied on them, the rest of the game being pure platforming. While it wasn't a contributing factor to why I loved Sonic Colors so much, I didn't mind it in the slightest.Unfortunately though, they manage to absolutely ruin any enjoyment from an unforgiving amount of levels in Sonic Lost World. First off, most of them control pretty poorly. The asteroid one, which turns sonic into a floating asteroid and destroys anything in its path, controls so horribly that it can get borderline unplayable at times. Sonic will just slide around like he's on ice and you'll find yourself falling off of what would otherwise be an easy platform to jump on. If you only had to use the asteroid powerup every once in a while, it wouldn't be that bad, but some levels in the game require you to use it for the majority of the 15 minute+ level. The same goes with the drill power-up, which returns from Sonic Colors. In Colors, you would use it for maybe 30 seconds at a time to get from point A to B, but in Lost World there was a level in the underwater-themed world where you literally used it for almost the entire time, doing almost nothing but drilling through whirlpools in the water. It was monotonous to say the least.Another huge problem with the game is the amount of ""puzzles"" that you're required to ""solve"". You'll start a level wanting to run to the finish line, but you're presented with two or three locked power-up boxes that can only be unlocked by slowly pushing snowballs or giant fruit into holes in the ground or rolling snowballs onto a certain set of switches. I know it's kind of ridiculous to judge a game on what I expected it to be as opposed to what is presented, but levels like these are just boring and lazy. I don't think there's a single soul out there who wanted multi-chamber switch ""puzzles"" in a Sonic game.  This problem is featured at its worst in act three of Frozen Factory, which has you pushing snowballs onto switches for a painfully long amount of time. It's probably the worst level I've ever played in a Sonic game.There are also parts which require you to kill a certain amount of enemies on-screen in order to continue. It was fine in some areas, but it was just lazy and boring in others, like parts where you had to sit there and lock onto two or three giant enemies over and over until they were all dead. It really just felt like a way to artificially extend the length of the game and it was unbelievably boring.Oh, and there are pointless motion controls that work in some place and not in others. I didn't mind it in one of the later levels where you ride on a rocket and tilt the 3DS to steer it, but I did mind it in the special stages where you have to pick up your 3DS and spin around your room like an idiot to steer. You won't be playing them on a bus or in a car, believe me.The game has a system where if you die a certain amount of times in a level, you can burst an item box which will either destroy nearby enemies or let you fly across the level, kind of like in Donkey Kong Country Returns. I never wanted to use them because I wanted to finish the level myself, but I would always find that if it were located next to an enemy that you had to lock on to, Sonic would automatically fly backwards and lock onto it.  It was incredibly annoying.Also, the entire last world was just a rehash of all of the game's bosses. There was not a single original level, except for the final boss.On a slightly positive note, the game features an online multiplayer section which lets you race through levels with people around the world. It's fun, but it can get a bit laggy sometimes.Overall, the game had so much potential to be great but it has so many problems that it makes the whole game below-average. It's not horrible, but it isn't very good either."
309974,B0019LTGOU,I don't think it is actually Jojoba oil. I think this seller is filling bottles with some other type of oil.,"Jojoba usually has a light texture and faint scent, this oil is heavier and smells like nuts. It made my skin break out right after I put it on, in a rash at first and pimples later.I actually believe this is a scam, I have never encountered ""jojoba oil"" like this in my life, and I've been a regular user of other brands for 5+ years. Either it's terrible quality, it's mixed with something, or it's something else altogether in the bottle. Also, the cap leak is very annoying, as other users have mentioned.*update* Amazon gave me a full refund. If you read other reviews, other buyers have reported weird nutty smells and other adverse qualities to this oil, suggesting at least 2 other people may have received an unknown oil as well.http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJZUY2I1IOB3/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B0019LTGOU&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=#wasThisHelpful"

So you shoot some bad guys but then as soon as you get comfortble doing that guess what they make YOU a bad guy and you have to shoot all them people in the airport with you're friends and then you aren't really the bad guy because the boss bad guy shoots you in the head so really you were a good guy killing and shooting all them inosent civileuns it's totally confussing but also it ROCKS and I totally OWNED on the easy difficult setting2) Multeplayer-  if you get your butt stomped and owned and powned and rented to own in multeplayer on modern wafares 2, then it was probly ME who did that to you SUCKA I'm not kidding when I tell you that I am the BEST and the FASTEST at shooting and grenadding and I just ekwip my rifle grenade and fire it off at you and you and youre buddys are GONE my friend that's it thats all she wrote.

1864117,B00009VRDI,2-1/2 stars -- Don't ask me why I bought this,"I didn't like Ashanti's debut album (or any song she released from there, for that matter), but I picked this album up because I wanted to give her another chance. Chapter II does have a pretty good leadoff single in ""Rock Wit U"", even though the way Ashanti keeps saying ""Awww baby"" DOES get irritating after a while. And it's pretty obvious who produced this song. But as for the album, it took me a while to get through it. In fact, it took me four days to get through it, and each day I asked myself, ""Isn't this album over yet?""Since this is a Murder Inc. record, there are some things you'll have to look forward to, one of which is oversampling. For instance, ""Sweet Baby"" samples Al Green's ""I'm Glad You're Mine"", ""The Story Of 2"" lazily lifts Rick James' ""Dream Maker"", and ""Feel So Good"" uses music from Barry White's ""Playing Your Game, Baby"" (oops, I mean Black Moon's ""I Got Cha Opin""). And those are only a FEW examples. Production is naturally overseen by Irv Gotti, but there are also production credits shared with Chink Santana and someone called Milwaukee Buck (*sigh*), and to say that Chink Santana's adlibs and rapping are annoying would be an understatement.Ashanti's singing is a tad better on here than it was on her first album, but in songs like ""Breakup 2 Makeup"", you really can't tell. And speaking of that song, lyrics aren't a strong point on this album either. ""Then Ya Gone"", ""Rain On Me"" and ""I Found Lovin'"" demand serious rewrites. And another thing, why are there so many skits? There are more skits and interludes on this album than there are Made Men ads in The Source magazine.The songs toward the end of the album are okay (even though I have no idea what she's saying in ""I Don't Mind"", but they still aren't anything to get excited about. Chapter II is a little better than Ashanti's first album, but it's still not worth getting.Anthony Rupert"
1764909,B001V2QQJA,Best flashlight ever!,"Highly recommended.  I've had Surefires before but not like this thing.  After about 8 months of owning the LX2, I've used it nearly every day, only on my third set of batteries (even with one time having left it on accidentally for an hour).  Each night I put it in my pocket before going anywhere - it's that small, light and handy.  The LX2 is unbelievably bright - yes, I hear the buzzing noise like others have said in reviews, but ""it don't hurt the going of it none""... I usually don't write reviews, but felt strongly enough of how awesome this light is to jump online and write about it.  You can literally use it like a spot-light at night; the beam is broad enough that there are no ""hot spots"" - very even and useful light.  Never thought I'd buy a $200 flashlight but this one is well worth it.  For a distance check, I feel comfortable knowing what is in the corner of the yard at 300' in total darkness using the LX2.  Heat output is rather high after a few minutes on full-blast, but you'd expect that for the sheer amount of energy coming out of the end of this thing.  Really like the clip, too; doesn't seem to ""over bend"" and break at all - very spring-like; retains its shape.  Funnest part - watch your friends' reaction when you fire it up at night - like you have the sun in your hand or something.  BTW, I grab this thing before I ever reach for my 10-lb spotlight - the LX2 is all you need."

I don't feel/see any difference. For what it's worth I took them in between meals.I gave them 2 stars as they didn't make me queasy or anything, just didn't notice any effects at all! Maybe if you took them longer or with food???"
1291846,B00KOEHQCW,2.5 Stars for its unforgiving gameplay,"Just like Frozen Free Fall, Maleficent Free Fall is another Candy Crush clone. If you're not familiar with Candy Crush Saga, the game involves matching three or more identical items to accomplish specific goals. In addition to sliding the gems you are trying to match, you can also use special spells (power ups). However, the spells use magic, which is limited. You can earn more magic by completing stages, but the amount gained is nowhere near the amount used per spell.Unlike Frozen Free Fall, this incarnation can be very punishing. Within the first two moves, you may already be doomed to fail. However, there are power ups that might help, but relying on them will cause you to deplete your magic very quickly. At this point, you can purchase more magic WITH REAL MONEY! In later levels, it's very clear that you are being &quot;bullied&quot; into making this purchase. For that reason, I would recommend Frozen Free Fall instead (even though it can be buggy)."
3761180,B00AX4TWAM,"Good paste wax, nice shine.","This isn't bad for paste wax.  It goes on fairly well with their special red waxing pad of high density foam, which won't crumble under the relentless job. It's fairly smooth and easy to get onto the pad and it goes on smoothly. I just had to remember, small sections and wipe off as it dries because it gets too hard after a while to easily remove.No, you can't do it in the sun, yes, you need to do it in small sections and thoroughly remove the wax, and if your finish is older, there are products such as paint cleaning clay to remove haze and minor scratches (there's another major pain)  before you apply this. If you do not have muscles like Schwarzenegger, you can use a random orbital polisher to make the job go easier. But--anyway you slice it, it's a job. However, it works well and will protect your finish far more than the Deluxe Super Wash at your local car automat. Before you start, it's well to acquire the supplementary products, either Griot or Mother's or someone's, to really do a good job as you are going to be investing ""sweat equity.""This wax isn't cheap. That is partly because carnauba comes from exactly one place in the world, a small crescent of shore in Northern Brazil, where the Copernica pruneifera palm grows. Due to the special climate, the carnauba palm closes up its leaves during the dry season and protects them with this natural botanical wax. The wax is filtered and graded, and the best grade wax is mixed with additives that improve spreadability and the finish. Even with polyurethane sealers and other chemical developments, the rare and natural carnauba palm wax is still unsurpassed for polish and protection."

The only thing that I can really say I feel is a slight problem is on the right side of the case when on the EVO it seems to be really felxible where the volume up/down buttons and it seems as though that set of clips doesn't really clip together as they should.  All other sides are nice a firm, but I'm assuming that one side is just because of the material missing for access to the volume up/down buttons.  Can that little bit of material make that big of a difference?  Other than that I would deffinetly recommend this to friends and other consumers, but ensure I pointed that one little thing out.

Drinking it became a chore.I ended up using only half a scoop per serving. (about quarter the recommended amount for the size of shakes I was making) This made it tolerable, but it was a hold your breath and chug kind of thing.I mixed this with the BlenderBottle (highly recommended) It works great for mixing this up, no chunks, and makes it very smooth to drink.I ended up giving it away when I just couldn't tolerate it any longer.There are MUCH better tasting ones out there.

3756705,B003POJ1DU,"Ineffective washing tool, too heavy when loaded with water.","I actually have the wash pads and they are not really effective because they hold so much water that they become heavy and cumbersome to use --especially on the side and lower parts of your vehicle.Also, they take forever to dry. One time I accidentally put them away in a container when I thought they were dry but the inside was still moist. The next day, they smelled like mold.You could toss these in the dryer but it would take forever to dry. When you leave them out to dry, they take a few days to completely dry before you can put them back in storage.As far as washing ability, I wasn't impressed. They don't lather up properly and I feel like every time I go over the paint, I am moving water around and not enough soap.My favorite car washing sponge is the Zymol sponge. You can get it for like 8 bucks on eBay. It is made from a higher quality sponge material, it is the perfect size, and it just makes car washing so much easier.  Microfiber is good for a lot of things but I think a good quality sponge is best for washing.  I actually like the sponge better than a sheepskin mitt (Griot's used to sell a superior sheepskin mitt which I have and still use.)I will admit that these micro fiber mitt's/pads look really cool and they feel great when they are dry but once you drop them in the water, they become so heavy that you can't efficiently use them. You might feel otherwise but I have a feeling if you use these, you will encounter the same problems I had.  IMO a good quality washing sponge/cloth should be lightweight when loaded with water and soap so that when you are washing your vehicle, you are able to produce lather.  This wash mitt/pad becomes so heavy when loaded with water that it is not able to effectively do that.I don't recommend this product to wash your car."
3583822,B00005MF9U,Exciting product needs major improvements,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I, for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake, caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
3743334,B0002Z9L8K,Dangerous,"I was enthused when I first saw this product. I strive to keep safety items in the car and house, so this one seemed perfect. A flare that runs on batteries? I could get a bunch of these for my car and for my boyfriend's car, and make sure we're always safe!I popped in the batteries and turned it on. This is a flare? I took it outside. I tried it at night. There NO way a car coming down a highway is going to see that tiny light and know anything is going on. A person relying on this is setting themselves up for a catastrophic disaster. Having a high-powered flare isn't just a casual ""nice to have"" thing. It can literally be the difference between staying alive and having a sleepy trucker barrel into the car, demolishing it.The light isn't even strong enough to read by in the car. There's nothing I would use this for. And the fact that they market it as a flare safety device concerns me greatly. I worry that someone will fall for that claim, try to use it as a flare, and end up with serious injuries - or worse.I highly recommend that people buy REAL FLARES for their cars and check on them every year or two. Have flashlights. Check the batteries. Safety is important.Definitely do not buy this product."
1758275,B001EYU5OC,Poor Description,"These bits have a 1/4"" hex shank.  They do not fit my driver, which takes a 5/16"" shank.

The box is nice and the bits look fine but I couldn't find a hand impact driver with 1/4"" shank for less than $50.  I ordered some 5/16"" shank Phillips #3 bits from another place.  I will keep this DeWalt set but will not buy the driver unless I need to use one of the specific bits."
1849176,B00000FDJX,Digital Dookie,"This album is just too strange for a true Wu-Tang fan to be able to appreciate. RZA is at his best when using a sample-based production style. Tracks like ""Domestic Violence"", although they could be done better, are RZA's bread and butter. This album shows that when RZA decides to create a track without samples, the outcome will dissapoint. He's an arranger, not a musician.Some of the beats sound like someone's little sister sitting at a casio, pounding random keys out of time (and I am speaking about one of my favorite producers of all time here).This album is not Wu-Tang style. Be clear on that if you're thinking of buying. It's RZA experimenting with a new sound. He is in unfamiliar territory now and he'd better find his way home soon."
1825659,B000001EG2,Fun pop/rock collection,"This record was a #1 hit all around the world for Elton John in early 1973 at a time when the English singer/pianist was continuing to get more and more popular, flamboyant and confident. As a result, Don't Shoot Me... is a very enjoyable set, and contains much more ""showbiz"" than any of his previous albums. By 1973, Elton was a genuine teen-appeal pop star, and was dressing in colourful costumes and oversized spectacles. Unlike many of the fleeting pop stars he competed with on the singles charts of that year, Elton was a great composer of songs, and this album kept his quality level very high indeed.Here, the best one is Daniel which is perhaps his all-time loveliest melody. This is always in his concert set to this day, and is a poignant tale of a returning serviceman, blinded in some war. His most fun-filled, throwaway song to date was Crocodile Rock, a very popular #1 hit in Australia and the USA that was aimed at his rapidly-expanding fanbase of young folks. The more measured, orchestrated syle of early albums like Madman Across The Water and Tumbleweed Connection also appeared here, represented by slow ballad epic Have Mercy On The Criminal, and Texan Love Song - an ode to conservative yokels everywhere. His newfound teenage popularity was reflected in I'm Gonna Be A Teenage Idol, apparently inspired by fellow glam rocker Marc Bolan. I especially like the terrific ballad album closer High Flying Bird, which has great echoey backing vocals performed by Elton's band: Dee Murray, Nigel Olsson and Davey Johnstone, and nice strings backing it. The gentle Blues For My Baby And Me has good strings in it too, and a travelogue tale of travelling on a Greyhound bus in America. Elton rocks on the groovy tune Midnight Creeper (where he namechecks Tina Turner!), and on the uptempo pop rocker Elderberry Wine (Crocodile Rock's B-side) Daniel's B-side was a re-recorded version of lovely 1969 song Skyline Pigeon, and this song sounds great here on CD with excellent instrumentation (it was clearly recorded at the same time as the rest of the album).The other bonus tracks on this ""Classic Years"" version of Don't Shoot Me... were actually recorded for Goodbye Yellow Brick road later in 1973, but were added here instead. All were later B-sides for singles later in 1973. Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady Again) is another fun teen rocker, while Jack Rabbit is a brief , fun country rocker, and Screw You fits in better with the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road style of song than here, but is also a pretty good biting sort of lyric.This album was one of the most popular records of its year, and is still lots of fun today. 5 stars!!"
1059478,B00B7RA9D8,LOTSA FUN,"I really, really like this game.  The graphics are great and the movement is fast to keep you from getting bored. Getting the bonuses and free spins come often enough to make this a pretty exciting game."
1665526,B00800525U,OK - BACK UP TO FIVE STARS FROM ONE STAR,"I opted to try this French Press for K-Cups instead of buying the more expensive Single Serve K-Cup brewers. The main complaint of the less expensive brewers was that after a while the pumps stopped working. We received the Cafejo unit about a week ago, and it worked great when we first tried it. We had company tonight, and after brewing about 3 cups, the water was NOT flowing through the press. Turns out the small sharp blade at the bottom of.the K-Cup basket had broken. Thus the bottom of the K-Cup wasn't being  punctured and no water could flow through it. I was able to pre-puncture the bottom of each K-Cup, and get it to work for the remainder of the guests. The rest of the press seems to be fine. I am very thankful that the blade tip was badly bent, instead of actually breaking off and possibly winding up in one of my guests cups. Prior to tonight's use and failure, I had tried it four times, and then on the third time tonight, it failed. That's seven times it was used, NOT a very good indicator. I have since contacted Cafejo and advised them of this problem and IF I hear from them, I will update this review. Other reviewers have come across this same problem, but I thought it may have been a fluke. I thought wrong....05/03/13 UPDATE: I have not heard a thing from Cafejo. I guess they could care less whether or not their products are reliable or if their customers are satisfied with the purchased product. I am lowering the 2 stars down to a 1 star.06/07/13 UPDATE: ONE VERY WEAK POINT - BUT ABLE TO BE FIXED - Since I never heard from Cafejo, I decided to try and fix the broken blade. I was able to make it work by using a stainless steel sheet metal screw, with a thread depth of exactly one inch. It can actually be a bit longer, but then the screw would interfere with those plastic re-usable K-Cup pods. When threaded thru the original hole of the K-Cup basket from the bottom, this screw acts as a very strong ""punch"". It will NOT seal the hole it punches, because it is going in straight without ""screwing"" thru the hole it makes. The threads kind of act as a channel for the coffee to flow thru. There are also 3 additional holes in the bottom of the basket, and it seems to work just fine (with absolutely NO THANKS to Cafejo). JUST BE SURE TO USE A STAINLESS STEEL SCREW.08/16/13 - It seems Cafejo read my review and commented on it, and asked me to call  them. I left a message on the number they gave me and apparently the owner of the company, named Pat, returned my call. He apologised for the problems and said that they had addressed the issues and took my info to send me new parts. I received the parts today and it does look like they now have a heavier duty blade. I was also sent a spare ""top punch"" that is at the bottom of the water cylinder.PLEASE NOTE - per my 6/7 update, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRESS. I was simply disappointed that Cafejo did not contact me from the message I left via their website. Except for the blade breaking, the sytem is fantastic. Using K-Cups, it makes a wonderful cup of coffee. I encourage you to give this system a try, and if you have any problems, contact them (but I don't suggest you use the ""contact"" function on their website)."

1414172,B001BNFQKO,GRAND THEFT. PERIOD.,"These days the Gaming Industry reminds me of Lemmings. No matter the obstacles and amount of reasoning there is simply nothing to be able to give them pause on their stampede over the cliff.2K GAMES crack-opened the door of idiotic DRM schemes (with its custom-made SecuROM 7.+ coupled with Limited Installations which were enforced by an irremovable RootKit), only to be followed by EA, then UBISOFT and finally ROCKSTAR. Even after the customers' backlash over the SPORE fiasco that was heard around the world, the people in charge seem less competent every day. And that is no small feat: they were already considered totally incompetent to begin with.To be fair, GTA4 does NOT limit the number of times one can install the game on the same computer (hence the extra rating star). On the other hand, it does introduce another bright idea, the...""Rockstar Social Club"" (and that is ON TOP of the LIVE nuisance). I wonder what sunstroked executive named THAT baby while vacationing in Cuba!Need for an ...uber-computer to run properly? Check.Intrusive DRM scheme? Check.Unoptimized porting? Check.Common crashes and instability? Check.(The list is long. ROCKSTAR really dropped the ball on this one...)My advice: wait for the major patches to be released (preferably for the DRM-removing patch as well) and the price to drop. Do not be surprised if it becomes clearance-bin fodder by the time of the after Christmas sales."

1369590,B000EGELQ4,"Wow, wish all sequals were like this","Though technically not a true sequel, Big Brain Academy is another strong game to test your mind.  The game is unlike Brain Age in several ways.  Instead of doing short, fast actions like simple math, you do all kinds of puzzles and other stuff.  THe art style is alot different.  Instead of the campy doctor's lobby look, the relaxed, cool look, Big Brain Academy goes for a cartoon style, with kid drawings, and a Mr. Peanut shaped worm.  Big Brain Academy is a slower game, and the challegnes are based on memory and other things, as opposed to the fast thinking in Brain Age that stimulates more than makes you think.Big Brain Academy does not measure how old your brain is, instead, it tells you how much your brain ways, and the heavier your brain is, the smarter you are.  The premise is different than Brain Age as well, but instead of comparing, just read my review of Brain Age when I write it, and do the comparing yourselves (hey, I'm just a college student).Basically, you have three modes, and you can have up to five seperate files for five seperate people.  YOu can  do a test that tests you on five seperate catergories supposly for the brain.  These are things that involve counting math cubes, drawing lines on shapes, mapping where the dog has a bone, and other random stuff.  You can do this as many times as you want, and you can also practice any event you like.  It sounds like a real pain in the butt, and really sounds like the last game you would want to play.  However though, the game proves that it's a great game, and passes the most important test, and it passes with flying colors. The test would in fact, be, the game is wicked fun.  I hate math, but for some reason, counting coins, contrasting weights, and other stuff that normally are mudane tasks in life, become strangly, very fun.  That's the best part, this game is fast, frantic, and fun.  This is most important, and I really think that you should get it.  DOn't listen to anybody who bashes it because of math, if you think math is fun, tell people.  Don't be a sucker to sterotypes.  So try this game, and it really is worth it.As for the whole ""makes you smarter"" hype, I am not sure I truely believe it, but I do think it makes our brain's in better shape, that it makes it work better. And besides, doing math has never, and never will be, more fun.  With the price, you should get it, and it will be a game that you will be coming back to...unless you have the brain of Stephen Hawking (and you don't)."

1531657,B00EFFW0HC,"Nothing new, and everything you remember and love from BF3 is worse.  Do not buy for current gen systems.","BLUF: Don't buy this game for current gen systems.I will continue to update this as I play more, but at this point, several hours into playing the multiplayer, I just can't recommend this game.  I love love love Battlefield 3, my first exposure to the franchise, but this game just sort of limps along, like it's older brother's reputation alone will ensure its success.  So far, it's failing.  It feel svery incomplete, the graphics are surprisingly poor and fuzzy, the levels small and unfinished (and unfurnished), and the damage models just atrocious. There are pros, but there are cons, and I'll try to list them out quickly and concisely and then apply more detail later on. I thought it looked bad in the Beta, but assumed they would clean it up for the actual game.  I was wrong.Pros:1) Sound.  It's excellent.  The weapons, the footsteps, the scream of the A10 as it pulls away from a strafing run are all deep, tangible, and real sounding.  They did a great job with this aspect.2) The COAX machine gun on tanks and APCs looks pretty close to the way it does in real life when the tracers go away.  It's pretty cool.Cons:1) Maps: BF3 was known for big, beautiful maps that gave all sorts of freedom of movement and plenty of room for air power to figure itself out.  The maps played so far (I'm playing a lot of conquest, known for big full vehicle maps) are all cramped, and if you're flying an attack jet, be prepared to turn it around real quick or risk getting timed out out of bounds.  Frustrating.  The &#34;Levolution&#34; isn't all that great either, and we played some level where the water kept rising, and it just got kind of stupid with the LAVs floating around lobbing rounds at each other and all the players essentially holing up in whatever building they started in because to try to swim to the next was sure to be met with a hail of gunfire.  You could level buildings in BF3 just fine, we don't need to cut the grass here...2) Soldier equipment layouts: There is no real incentive to advance your weapon of choice as you start with some pretty good kit.  That motivation to evolve drove a lot of playing and varied playing style in BF3, and it's everybody running the same load out so far and I imagine will be like that as players evolve.  This will make it much harder for new players to join when vets discover the magical weapon combo that is surely out there.3) Weapons:  I don't know what the designers were thinking when they made the rocket that all engineers start out with, but it's horrible for game play and I'm unsure of how or why it was necessary.  It's part SMAW/RPG and part Javelin, so basically if you throw a rocket anywhere near a vehicle, it will &#34;lock on&#34; adjust in flight, and execute a top down attack.  This is cool and all, but removes the fun of dumb-flight rockets and the skill needed on the anti-tank soldiers part and on the player who is being targeted in the vehicle.  Several weapons are seriously overpowered, and then there's the vehicles....4) Vehicles: Apparently, a main battle tank can't travel faster than about 10 miles an hour.  This is against all my understanding and experience gained as a Tank Platoon Leader in the Army.  The good thing is that the vehicles can actually take some damage and survive. This is of course, vital, as everybody now has magic rockets that they can throw in your general direction and achieve hits.  The bad thing is that it takes over 5 rockets to kill an APC, which is really stupid.  I've actually run out of ammunition firing on an APC, registering hits the entire time, and had to reteat while the vehicle sat there oblivious and shooting away in the other direction.This has been a terrible experience, and the only reason I'll keep it on hand is to level up for when it does show up for the XBOX ONE.  I just hope about 300 patches and fixes also show up with it.  I'll never pre-order a game like this again after this experience, and I do mean it.  This has been a big disappointment."

Overall its the best 4 wheeleing game ive ever played. There are plenty of levels in carrer mode. The races arent too hard. You have a large choice of mufflers, 4 wheelers, gloves, suites, gogles, tires, mini games and many more. In freeride there are cool levels theres ones where your at an army base theres another where your all around puddles and alot more amazing inviorments. Most of all THERE ARE PLENTY OF JUMPS. There are good songs. The only thing i didnt like was the graphics when your in the menu but the graphics when your racing and stuff are amazing. its not to hard to bust out tricks. I'd reccomend this game for a person into racing and exitment. Another thing is is that its not realy good for a person just buying a playstation 2 but overall one of the best games ive play on playstation 2."

All I wanted was a simple LED version of my old Jr model.Amazingly, this flashlight still uses the old ring-type Cree emitter (I bought this new from Amazon).  Most manufacturers got rid of that years ago.  It produces the classic hated ""cree ring"" beam with an extra dim area surrounding the spot beam, then a sloppy thin bright ring outside of that, before finally producing the normal smooth flood area.  Someone else already uploaded a beam picture more than 2 years ago, and the latest stock still looks like that, though in reality the spot beam looks worse (the spot beam tends to wash out in photos, making it look more consistent than it is).  The spot area is slightly lopsided and not consistent.The finish is a very fine matte texture which looks and feels like a quality product.The tail cap looks like it doesn't fit on all the way.  The back end of the body tube has a tapered-out area which makes it look like a perfect fit to match the width of the tailcap, but there is a gap between them.The only good reason I can think of to get this flashlight is if you want exactly the lumen output offered in order to use less battery power than other flashlights which tend to be brighter at the expense of battery life, though most of them have low or medium modes to accomplish that."

1840446,B000002OPL,Gimmick...the 1997 remaster with new packaging.,"Janie Hendrix, Jimi's adopted sister and sole heir to his music copyrights, dropped the MCA record label and signed a new contract for reissuing Jimi's catalog on Sony in 2010. It seems kinda ridiculous that every 2 or 3 years, whenever she wins a copyright lawsuit or decides to switch record labels, she ""remasters"" the entire catalog. How many victory reissues do we need? Anyway, she decided to reissue these albums on CD in 2010, which not only generates buzz for guaranteed sales but, also makes her a lot more profit off Hendrix's name. She cares more about benefits from sales of the physical product more then about protecting the legacy of a great musician. Here's the truth... These are the 1997 remasters in new ""earth-friendly"" cardboard packaging with a worthless DVD. It's a 17 minute DVD with producer/engineer Eddie Kramer talking about Jimi and playing a snippet of a few songs. We've already heard the songs and know he's good. Nothing interesting or new. The albums should have gotten a fresh remaster for 2010 and the second disc could have been better utilized as bonus tracks, such as outtakes or live stuff. Even the booklets and disc labels themselves look exactly the same. If you bought the last remasters you don't need any of the main 3 studio albums, Band Of Gypsys, or First Rays. 5 stars for the album itself but, zero stars for the disc. This 2010 reissue is not a remaster and is definitely screwing the public."

I really enjoyed this CD because most of the tracks were like a look into his life, his reality. Songs like ""Dreams"" ,""Don't Need Your Love"", ""Start From Scratch"", and ""Like Father Like Son"" are some of the realest rap songs that I have heard in a long time. Other hits include of course the singles ""How We Do"" and ""Hate It Or Love It"", ""Westside Story"", ""Higher"", ""Put You On The Game"", ""Runnin'"", and ""Don't Worry"". I'm happy that the Game parted ways with G-Unit, to me, he was the most talented rapper on the label. BKLYNBABYLON signing off..."

I've passed all the main series games multiple times and even some of the spin offs.This game dropped off a cliff. RE 5 was good and especially in co op. This game sucks either way but it doesn't matter because you can't see anything.The darkness is so bad that you'll get attacked out of nowhere cause you can't see.It tells you to adjust the brightness at the start and is way off. I had to turn the brightness all the way up on my TV.Toss this garbage. I regret buying it and only have it so I can say I have all the main games but is definitively the worst and a bad game.Stick to RE 4 Wii edition or the GC REmake.

However, it is about twice as heavy. It also has an annoying plug that doesn't go into my phone unless I take my case off.

2515933,B00005JNEI,the film that got George W. Bush re-elected...,"Many left-leaning people like myself were disgusted at the deliberately misleading elements in this film; for example, Michael Moore's cruel and completely slanderous attempt to imagine verbally George W. Bush's thoughts as Bush is informed of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center. Moore suggests that Bush was thinking only of Saudi oil investments. None of us knew what was going in those early minutes of the terror strike on the Trade Center, as the unthinkable took place. Anyone who has taken an introductory course in Logic learns of the fallacies of making logical assumptions based on innuendo. I was just revolted by Moore's completely immoral, hate-filled screed of a 'film'. Moore also insulted the intelligence of the American people by assuming that they would believe his innuendo-filled comments. And this is where he went wrong: the American people were/are not as stupid as Moore believes them to be, and many people were insulted by Moore's arrogant attitude and assumptions, as he spoke down to them as if they could not think for themselves. And in their disgust at Moore's condescension, and ad hominem portrayal of a man who, whether you liked his policies or not, just happened to have the job of president of the United States at the time of the horrific terror attack, many viewers of this movie quite likely voted FOR George W. Bush, not against him. I truly believe that this shoddy film actually caused more people to vote FOR George W. Bush in November 2004, than against him. Moore's arrogance and carelessness boomeranged on him. If Moore had not made this movie, perhaps G. W. Bush would not have been reelected.I had somewhat enjoyed Moore's simplistic earlier effort, 'Bowling For Columbine', and was expecting much better than this trashy attempt at money-making through slander-based controversy. I should have known better; Moore is an entertainer, and not an insightful political analyst by any stretch of the imagination. Thank God that many Americans (including left-leaning ones like me) have something called education and/or common sense and can recognize lies and deception like the kind Moore attempts to foist off on the public.An interesting related read is 'The Trouble with Islam. A Wake-Up Call For Honesty and Change' by Canadian Muslim lesbian author Irshad Manji, who also dismisses Michael Moore.That Moore's trash won the 'prestigious' Palme D'Or film award in France is only because of the ever-present and fashionable anti-Americanism prevalent in French 'intellectual' circles, and yet another symptom of the cultural malaise that France has experienced in recent years, and about which much has been written.Note also political commentator Andrew Sullivan's creation of the 'Moore Award', for ""divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric""."
1768691,B002FCNLHK,"Very nice product:  well built, works well, bright","Well made.  Sturdy.  Comes with mounting hardware.  Nice bright light of 80 lumens per manufacturer.  Will light up stairs or dark closet easily.  Good sensing range.  Will not turn on if area is already lit.  Uses 4 C cell batteries.  This product will work with rechargeable batteries, but they will not last as long as alkaline per the manufacturer.  (I called their toll-free number on their website to confirm.)  The warranty period is 1 year.  Warranty service through Mr. Beams.  The light is not diffuse:  it illuminates a sharply-defined cone beneath the light.  The higher the light is mounted, the wider the circle of light at floor level.  This light is best for overhead lighting.  It would be too bright to mount on a wall where the LED light could be direct."

1297955,B000B6DHB2,Bummer,"I wanted to like this. I really did. The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;Perfect&#34;. However, the unit I received was cr@p, and I'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. The one I got kept cutting in and out. You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. And when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. The so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. Bummer. Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?Cheers"

1825746,B000001EG8,Elton Greets The World,"""I looked up/And saw the empty sky/If I could only/Could only fly...""If Elton only knew what was to come.The first Elton John, though only released in the U.S. in the mid-70s, after his run of big singles was beginning to dry up, has a feeling more of cleaning up after the elephants as much as it does of leading the parade. Elton's voice, in the notable title track, the best song on the original track lineup, sounds as world-weary as it would on ""Blue Moves,"" recorded some seven years later. The lyrics of ES are less sharp than usual, though the subjects are less the broken relationships Bernie Taupin came to write about so obsessively later in his career, and more in line with pre-teen daydreaming about Norse gods and escape. Maturation was still to come, along with the pop chops and chart-topping savvy.There's nothing great on this collection to recommend it to a non-completist, it's a little too proggy and twee. That said, a casual fan will find worthwhile things. The melodies are pretty if unmemorable, with songs like ""The Scaffold"" and ""Western Ford Gateway"" standouts on the hummability meter. How's this for an unusual complaint for a pop record: Too much harpsichord!The song ""Empty Sky"" is the major revelation, because it really showcases a different Elton than we saw performing ""Your Song"" the following year. It's an interesting peek at the artist behind the showman, just following his muse and trying to figure out what works, and the crunchy guitar licks are pretty sensational, though the song never quite gels in the way of a ""Philadelphia Freedom"" or ""Benny And The Jets.""The best song on the CD is not from the original album, but ""Lady Samantha,"" which when released as a single some months before gave Elton his first (minor) radio success. That churns and burns in Elton's characteristically pleasing manner.If you like Elton a lot, you will like ""Empty Sky."" If you listen to his Greatest Hits packages once in a while and want to dig deeper, you might start with something more like ""Captain Fantastic"" or ""Tumbleweed Connection."" This is a good recording, tarnished only by the fact its maker(s) would go on to do a lot better."
1543752,B000E1BLK8,NOT a Diabetic Friendly Food,"This product contains Maltodextrin and so is NOT diabetic friendly. Maltodextrin reacts on blood glucose the same way as if you ingested table sugar. As per my physician: If you are diabetic, pre-diabetic or have a family history of diabetes you should AVOID maltodextrin.When I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January 2012, though I cut back my carb/sugar intake to no more than 20 grams per day, my blood sugar readings would frequently shoot up from within normal levels to either close to 200 or even over 200. I thought it was because my blood glucose meter was no good or something.The metformin I was taking caused gastric distress so I was on a clear liquid diet for a few days to clear that up. The diet consisted of water, low sodium, msg free chicken broth and sugar free jello. After I had been on the diet for almost 2 days, I had to go in for an additional lab. Since I thought my blood glucose meter was malfunctioning, I asked the lab to test my blood glucose and with the same blood sample, I used my meter to test. The lab test was 186 and my meter was 183. The head of the lab said that is very accurate for a home meter so why was my blood glucose so high????It turns out, it was from the sugar free jello that contains maltodextrin. It couldn't have been from the chicken broth or water and those were the only two other things I was ingesting. Later, my new physician confirmed that maltodextrin was definitely to be avoided.Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them from my diet, my blood glucose readings quickly normalized and have been normal ever since.Note that this product says it contains maltodextrin from CORN. Most people know that corn is a carbohydrate and is NOT a free food for diabetics. Because of how the law reads, manufacturers who include maltodextrin in their products do not have to count it as a carbohydrate or sugar in the nutritional information on the label they only have to list it in the ingredients.This page mentions that the American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association says sugar free Jello is a ""free"" food and I don't know if those entities say that or not but it is NOT safe for diabetics and you can check with your diabetes educator or your endocrinologist to make sure but I'm absolutely POSITIVE that it spiked my own blood glucose REPEATEDLY. If you still doubt it, fast for a few hours, take your blood glucose reading, eat some of this Jello then wait 15-30 minutes and test again. I'm betting if you are like me - a non-insulin dependant diabetic - you'll see a spike in your blood glucose. How many spikes does it take before it affects your eyesight? Your kidneys? Your heart? Or before you get diabetic neuropathy? I don't mean to be an alarmist but if you have diabetes then you NEED to know what to avoid and those companies who tout their products as being diabetic friendly should have to tell the truth and be accountable. This is a DIET food but that does not make it suitable for diabetics."
2490788,B00005JLRT,Worst Trek EVER!!,"The central theme of this one seemed to be to strive to be a better man. Picard, at one point, relays this moral lesson to his clone who is bent on destroying the Federation to satisfy his own personal demons. Picard's message should have been directed towards the producers, writer, and director to strive to make a better film. Has Star Trek, I wonder, suffered from severe overkill and attrition with TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, comic books, books, conventions, geeks that dress up in Federation regalla, and not to mention 10 films(the first SIX of which are excellent especially TREK IV-Voyage Home)? The trend of how the even films are superior was broken with this installment. I will continue, however, to rock on with my personal favorite Voyage Home. I was ten years old in 1979 when Star Trek-TMP premiered, and that one actually aged like wine. I think this one will age like vinegar.BRING ON STAR WARS EPISODE III! By the way, the only reason I did not give this one 1 star was that the effects and sound were redeeming enough not to place it in a category with other 1-star failures like Heaven's Gate!"

The color is a cloudly mustard yellow which reminds me of pineapple juice toned down with whole milk.  I only finished three quarters of one serving.  At 140 calories a serving there was no sense drinking the entire thing since the faint aftertaste was musty--like drinking something old and stale."
1830237,B0000025YM,Judas Priest - Defenders Of The Faith,"Judas Priest's ninth studio album was released in 1984. Defenders Of The Faith is an album often celebrated by Priest fans but isn't as famous as some of their other albums like Painkiller, British Steel or Screaming For Vengeance. The album doesn't feature as regularly in top 100 album countdowns but don't let that discourage you; this is a very good record indeed.After the band's previous album Screaming For Vengeance had taken the band to new heights of popularity, breaking the US market two years earlier, Priest had a tough job following it up.Defenders Of The Faith does a good job of trying however. It largely follows the formula of its predecessor, only with a marginally heavier and darker edge. Tracks, such as `Eat Me Alive,' and `Freewheel Burning,' are the type of big and exciting Heavy Metal songs that you want from Judas Priest, and they mix neatly in with slower material like `Love Bites,' or `Night Comes Down.'It could be argued that Defender's Of The Faith is a sort of perfect center of Judas Priest's 1980s output. Not flashy or innovative, not a big departure or a new chapter but an absolutely refined and well crafted album of the sort of music you want from the band.If you like Judas Priest, don't overlook Defenders Of The Faith. The songs are good, the performances are good and the album has all the wailing vocals and guitar solos that the band stands for. I highly recommend it."

2534752,B00005JPBO,"""What Day?...Game Day!"" ~ Rising From The Ashes","I was eighteen in 1970 and remember reading in the newspaper the tragic story of the plane crash that killed the Marshall University football team, coaches and assorted university supporters. Needless to say that the release of the '06 film `We Are Marshall' awoke a few memories of the past and I was intrigued to see what had transpired to the university and surrounding community after such a devastating, traumatic loss. Whether the story told is accurate to the actual event I couldn't say, but it is definitely successful as an enjoyable and inspirational movie ala the beloved `Rudy'.Matthew McConaughey does a superb job at playing the unorthodox, off-the-wall replacement coach Jack Lengyel as does Matthew Fox as the quilt ridden surviving assistant coach who didn't get on the plane. Memorable performances abound in this film making it one that will stand up to many repeat viewings. If you're into sports movies or just appreciate an uplifting tale of triumph over adversity this is a film you'll want to add to your permanent DVD collection.My Rating: There are a few somewhat contrived and predictable moments obviously meant to tug on your heartstrings, but overall a fine film: -4 1/2 Stars-."

1680500,B00DBSFXUK,"Addictive Like Regular Cheez-Its and Peppery, But Not Spicy","I must confess that I don't buy Cheez-Its very often.  Why?  Because they're addictive and I could probably eat an entire box in one sitting.  I love spicy stuff, so I decided to give the new Cheez-It Zingz a try with its new chipotle cheddar taste.  One good thing about regular Cheez-Its is that you're usually not left with gunk on your fingers when dipping into the box because the flavors all baked in.  With these new Zingz, it's like regular Cheez-Its coated in flavoring that definitely adheres to your fingers, giving them, too, that tasty coating.I appreciate that Cheez-Its are baked instead of fried, giving them that healthier appearance.  Unfortunately, half of the calories in Cheez-Its (and Cheez-It Zingz) are from fat, so that's not much better than a fried potato chip.  The ingredients are pretty limited and mostly natural, so that's a plus.  No High-Fructose Corn Syrup here.Now for the taste.  You can definitely taste the peppery chipotle flavor in every bite.  Is it spicy?  Sadly, no.  These are all about flavor and not punch (contrary to the packaging).Would I buy this flavor over the regular Cheez-Its?  Possibly occasionally.  Nothing beats the simple addictive taste of the original, though, and they're not as messy."
1300436,B001LNN30E,Plain Jane is Really Good,"This is the first guitar I've bought without playing it first, so I was apprehensive. But it's a fine guitar. It's plain to look at - no decoration or embellishments, but the sound is rich and full, as if it were at least ten years old. I like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing. The tuners are geared low, which allows precise tuning. It came with Savarez strings - not the best I've used, but good. And I was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag. It's strong and durable, and well designed. All in all, I doubt I could have found a better quality product for such a low price."

GIMME SOME, this is one of the worst songs ever done, THE HEAT the main title track, dough, is extremely absurd and boring, the HEAT failed to achieve any other successful track beside HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH, and coming from selling 8 million for each previous album she recorded, to sell only 2 million with THE HEAT, is a huge drop, with good reason this was the RECORD that ruin and ended her succesful career, so sad cos SECRETS is the perfect sugestive album, a masterpiece.

I dumped them into a pot with soil they haven't grown much since then either.I enjoyed having sprouts daily. Its a great feeling to reap from what you sew and trust where its coming from. The mixes were really great once they grew the different flavors were tasty. But I think some seeds might need more soaking or something.
1652474,B005KK3N36,Yuck!,"I am a big Quaker Oats brand fan.  But, these cookies are horrible.  And that's not just my opinion.  Two others in my family sampled this cookie and were equally appalled at its taste.  So, let's start there.  This cookie is almost tasteless:  no almond flavor; nor chocolate; and there is no pronounced earthy oatmeal flavor, too.The cookie is soft, and while I don't care for soft cookies, the other two do, but this soft baked oatmeal cookie didn't win any fans between them.  To Quaker's credit, they individually wrap each cookie to maintain its softness.Each cookie is nearly 200 calories for barely more than an ounce of pleasure.  The box's photo leads one to believe there are large chunks of chocolate and almonds lodged in each cookie.  That's just not the case--unless you are viewing them with a magnifying glass.In our house, cookies cannot get stale.  They're gobbled up and gone in no time.  It's no exaggeration to say that this less-than-half-eaten cookie sat on the kitchen counter for over 24 hours and would be there still, had we not thrown it into the garbage can.Overall, this new product is a disappointment.  If it were possible to rate it below one star, that's what it would earn.Quaker, we love you, but send your bakers back into the test kitchen.  This one's a dud!"
1408913,B0016BVYAM,Bioshock 2 Explained,"This game is very fun, a lot more fun than people say it is.  People are saying that this game is just like the first game, and it's not worth buying.  Well, even though that is not completely true, if you liked the first game, you would want to play more, so you should buy this.Now, that is not true, because the game play is a little different.  This game continues from the original Bioshock, where you are a Big Daddy (and you have the drill and rivet gun).  Throughout the game you kill other big daddies and steal their little sisters.  Their little sisters will show you where to go to find adam filled corpses.  Once you arrive at the corpses, they will draw the adam out, and Splicers will come running.  It is your job to protect her by killing the Splicers.  After she has drawn the adam from two different corpses, she will have to be sent through the vent (she can be rescued or harvested).  You get the adam that she collected from the corpses.  In this game, you have to watch out for Big Sisters, which are super fast robots that come after you whenever you send a Little Sister through the vent.  Also, Brute Splicers are spread throughout Rapture.  Brute Splicers are big Splicers that don't have guns, but instead, they throw large objects at you.  You can buy little miniature turrets to setup (that only last for a few minutes), but can kill Splicers that come towards you and your Little Sister.There are a few other cool things in this game, like how you can remotely hack turrets and cameras from far away.  There is also a dart that you can shoot at something to automatically hack it instantly for you.  There are also plasmids available that can turn you into a ghost, and allow you to summon your own security bots whenever you want, and to BEFRIEND A SPLICER You can have a Splicer on your side!) for a few minutes.  You can use plasmids and a gun at the same time, which is pretty cool.Hacking in this game is different.  Whenever you hack, the game does not pause.  Instead of rearranging parts of a pipe, you have to try to stop a needle in a green or blue zone several times.  If you stop the needle in a blue zone, you get extra things, like free items from a vending machine, a free first aid kit, turrets can be stronger, and security cameras can have longer alarms.  If you stop the needle in a green zone, you hack it successfully, in a red you set of an alarm, and in a white you get shocked.I personally like the maps better than the first game.  They are easier to travel around in, and have cool little areas in them (Some maps are like little towns!).  The game is barely shorter than the first, but you can't travel back to previous levels once you leave them (but you can keep a save of each level so you can go back to them whenever you want).As far as the Windows Live thing goes, you can easily create an offline profile so you don't have to have your internet connected each time you play (you don't even have to have a Windows Live account).  To do this, click on ""Create New Profile"", scroll down to the bottom, and click on the ""create a local profile"" link.  If you don't use an offline or online profile, you can't save your game!As far as the online activation and install limit, a lot of other games have this too, and it's not really much of a big deal.One disadvantage that really annoys me, is sometimes whenever I hit escape to save, it goes back to a menu that looks kind of like the main menu, but it's not the exact same (And all of my progress is lost!).  So I always do a quick save before doing an official save in the escape menu.  I also save frequently.You should check the computer requirements for this game before buying, because it requires more resources and power than the first (if your computer doesn't meet the requirements it will still let you play).  If your computer doesn't meet the requirements, when the dialog box appears you can't move the mouse, so hit CTRL + ALT + DEL, launch the task manager, then use the tab and enter key to switch to the dialog box and pres enter on ""Yes"".So I would DEFINITELY recommend this game, especially for the affordable price that is being charged.I bought mine from ""NYC Electronics"" and it arrived in perfect condition (and factory sealed)."

I cannot recommend this movie highly enough and for all the ladies out there, you will fall hopelessly in love with James Shigeta!  My heart has palpitations just seeing his face and hearing his beautiful voice.  Of course, the entire cast is superb and you will find yourself immersed in a romantic fantasy that will melt any heart."

I have an otterbox defender. I ended up getting a tunebelt arm case. Sooooo happy I did. Fits my phone and case with no problem. Easy to slide in and out but stays snug during vigorous activity. Worked well in the rain and could still use my touchscreen with no problem!"

334271,B001H54S82,Bought at Walmart in southern Nevada.,"This tape is useless. It is good for ONE thing, to wrap around a finger or toe so that it adheres to ITSELF and yes then it will stay on well, but it does not adhere at all to skin even if the skin is dry and oil-free. 3M Nexcare grossly exaggerates when they state that this tape adheres to gauze and skin, even wet and sweaty skin! It doesn't do that at all. It's not &#34;tape&#34; in my book. Tape actually sticks to things. At most, this is a less stretchy, but more cushioning version of Coban.For future reference, the lot number on my package (just purchased today) is 13320.Pro's: cushioned, prevents blisters, breathable, hypoallergenic, somewhat caucasion skin-toned (though way too dark and yellowish for my own skintone), stretchy, package was fairly easy to openCon's: does not stick to anything but itself (not skin, nor gauze, can't be waterproof when it doesn't stick to anything!)I am very disappointed with Nexcare."

1300935,B002C741BI,Awesome,Very authentic sound reproduction. Simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear. The threaded end is 'holed' so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock. You'll never get your arm in there far enough.

1795631,B0055OSRRE,Do not waste your money!,"I was deeply disappointed with this knive.  In a survival situation, the last thing you want to happen is to cut your fingers.  Bear Grylls is known for survival, so I could not understand why Gerber did not put a blade lock on this knife.  If you are carving a spoon, if you push to hard on the blade, you could close this razor sharpe blade on you fingers.  Yes, it would be a dumb move to do, but if you are lost, are you really going to be thinking correctly?  It would not have been hard for Gerber to put this simple and much needed safety divise on this knife, and they did not.  I would not recommend this knife.  You could get a Browning Wingman and get a much better deal then this knife that does not deserve to have Bear Grylls name on it."
1357205,B0007LWN0M,Great game,"I bought this game for PC. It is really fun. I don't like many star wars games but this one is fun. You play the first 3 episodes (the 3 newest movies). Its a little short and i wish i had waited and not paid what it was when it first came out, but it still is fun. even though you beat it you can go back and play all the levels over as you need unlocked characters to get to certain areas that you couldn't first time around. the game play and graphics are great. For the people complaining that it wouldn't work on their PC, its because its a cheap PC. I tried to load it on my laptop and it wouldn't because laptop video cards aren't meant for 3d gaming unless you buy something like and Alienware made for games. So i loaded it on a PC i built myself and it worked great. All you need is a compatible video card and you are all set. So for those buying the cheap PCs with integrated graphics, it might not work. My video card was less than $100 too so its not like i put anything crazy in it. the whole PC was like $400 to build."
65466,B0061XLUSG,Awesome product,"I was not very sure what I would get when I ordered this item, but at such a low price I figured I would give it a shot. Order was received promptly and to my surprise it's a very high quality product, as good as ""the other"" brand I have been buying for years that are about 10 times the price! It's easy to apply and works great all around. I will definitely buy again. I highly recommend it."
112434,B0090YGJ4I,didnt like it at all,I got this because I am a klutz & drop my phone all the time. I have had other otter boxes but this one is just poor design. I thought the birds would be cute (not all cases have birds I found out) & the rubber backing wasn't flush with the hard plastic case. I threw out the packaging (trash came right after) so now I am stuck with it. I bought a regular black & white otter box. This one sits in my drawer.
1338946,B00007LV7Y,Great series,"Great series that still had its roots with it in this game. Great atmosphere, story and pace. It's a bit overrated but still a very fun game."

As all 22learn apps that we&#8217;ve tried so far, this one is fun, educational and one of the best out there. It keeps my energetic kids entertained at the same time we learn so much playing the puzzles. It offers the best way to practice alphabet, sounds and words. I&#8217;m really happy that there are quality educational apps like this one. I definitely recommend it!"
3750257,B000S2QVYE,Excellent Wire Set,I always use genuine gm parts in all of my vehicles and never have any problems. The wire set came with dielectric grease in the boots to protect the spark plug and wire so they can be remove easily.

3754034,B001V8U12M,Best accessory ever,This socket fits the camper jack perfectly and the squared tip holds well in the rechargable drill used to power it.  Sure beats using a hand crank to raise/lower the jack stand.
1844842,B000003TA0,Sundays are better than others.,"Boy was this album on my soundtrack to summer 1990, and it's gotten much play ever since. When I feel the need for catchy, yet smooth and mellow pop, this goes on. Of course how can you not also fall in love with Harriets angelic voice? The hit ""Here's Where The Story Ends"" is on here, but it's truly an average track on an above-average album. I hesitate to say this is quite as good as their follow-up ""Blind"", but it's overall better than ""Static And Silence"" in my opinion. All three are wonderful though. Maybe we'll get a collection someday. I guess in hind-sight my teachers were all right, ""Reading, Writing and Arithmetic"" would be important in my life."
3749981,B000PJCBOE,"Thin, poor zipper performance, NOT waterproof!","OK so these looked like they might be OK for the price and are made in Washington State (buy local thing).  I was terribly disappointed that a local Washington State company would claim these are waterproof (they know how it rains here).  These boots leaked buckets as the water ran off my waterproof riding suit pant legs right down into the upper part of the boots.  Within minutes of riding the boot was saturated.  The zippers also failed after about a week, the upper stop came off and the zipper just pulled right off in my hands!  Don't expect any support or protection from this boot either, it's front is sort of ""armored"" but the sides and the rest of the boot is very very thin material. Vega will not deal with any of these issues and say I must go through the dealer I purchased them from... however the dealer says they didn't make the boot or the claim of waterproofing so that's a warranty/advertising issue and to go through Vega. Catch 22 right?  If I ever get this resolved to my satisfaction (return for full refund) I'll post how much effort it took. For now I would avoid VEGA at all costs due to poor products and terrible customer service."
1559009,B000H7LVKY,"Taste Good, But..........","Ok, these are excellent cherries and go well with numerous types of foods. I ordered them after reading an article about the benefits of tart cherries. However, I was more preoocupied with the thought of the benefits than the amount of cherries in the order. A 4-pound box of cherries is a whole lot of cherries. I highly recommend these but for me, a smaller package would be more practical."
1849836,B00000IFNQ,1 or 2 highlights but mostly filler,"This album is basically just a resume of Swizz Beats' production skills. The album isn't the best of year, it's just an album. The only two songs that shine are Eve's &quot;What Ya Want&quot; and Jay-Z's &quot;Jigga My  Nuh.&quot; Other than that, the album's a waste of time and money."
3628571,B000GLNFO6,brush picks up hair better than anything I have bought before!,"I have two cats and a small Papillon. They have their own sofa and sleeping area but cleaning them up (sleeping areas) was always a pain. Or if they jumped on the bed or the other sofa I would go through endless lint rolls. I then thought getting them a sheet/cover for their sofa would do the trick but when I washed it weekly I would still lint roll it before and it would take three rinse cycles to get the pet hair off. I cannot tell you how many lint rolls I went through. When I bought this I really had no use for the glove. My animals are rather small. However, the brush is a lifesaver!! I run it over their sleeping areas and unlike the lint roller/sheets it picks everything up! It lifts the hair from the fabric so it is loose so you can clean it from there. Sometimes if more than a week has passed and there is a lot of hair,  the hair will fly in the air but not too bad. It usually stays in one area and is very easy to pick up and discard. Sometimes instead of washing their sofa it looks so good I just use the brush and let it be. This one brush has saved me a lot off my water bill along with the endless lint rollers I was buying. Cleaning it is a breeze! I use one disinfectant wipe and it is like new. I did not have high expectations of this item but it is something I cannot live without now. It really does pick up the hair, all of it at that."
2844698,B000CEXG3W,Japanese version Vs. American version,"I would suggest you watch at least one episode on Toonami before purchasing this. That way you get an estimate of how many times an episode Naruto say's ""Believe it!""For the american version of this you come to realize that they make Naruto out to be overly obnoxious and annoying. While in the Japanese version he doesn't act near this annoying. Sure he's annoying at the begining, but he hasn't matured yet. In later episodes it shows that he's matured a lot (still makes his random mistakes, and is a bit proud... ot proud to admit he's wrong, or inferrior in some ways.)I'm not sure how this edited version turned out, maybe they take out specific words and replace them with ""dang"" and remove the blood. which is ok if your below the age of 14... But if you think about it, it removes the overall feeling of the struggles of a ninja.Overall Viz did a horrible job casting voice actors (with the exception of, Shikimaru, and one or two others.) Shino sounds like a bloated retard, when he's supposed to give you the feeling of a mysterious, calm, and goth personality..I dread to see what they do to Bleach, since Viz picked that up too. (Bleach, Naruto, and Full Metal Alchemist are my top three anime, and so far Full Metal Alchemist was the only on to get royal treatment... we'll see how Bleach Fairs, once voicing actors are casted.)Sound: 2 out of 5Voice acting is annoying, some lines are over used.Musical score, is the same as in Japanese version which is perfect for the theme of this show. If it has the option to watch it in Japanese with subtitles, do yourself a favor and do that... Your ears will thank you.Animation: 4 out of 5Animation flows smoothly and fits the story well.Story: 4 out of 5The story is deep and takes a lot of twists. The downfall here is that it progresses a bit slowly, but that in turn makes the show last longer."

1861470,B00006M183,Someone Stole This Cd,"Everytime a new Pearl Jam cd comes out I buy it, why?  I think because in the early '90s they stood for so much.  I wanted to like each cd, but disappointment is what I receive. So when someone stole this cd from me I have never missed it nor wanted to replace it.  Hopefully thier new cd will rock but I will have to be sold on it before I buy it.No one can deny what a great cd Ten was, and I didn't want each cd to sound like it, I just wanted more of the feeling but each release was flat.  I know their is legion of fans but you know exactly what I am talking about.I give this two stars because with each Pearl Jam cd their is one or two tracks that are good.  Just have to fumble through all the cr4p on them, and for me I am just sick of it."
1313889,B00004S99S,An eyeful of artistic wonder,"Rating:AWhile the Sega Dreamcast will always be known for its niche following of specific licenses, and projects that were well thought out but never received the commercial accolade they so deserved, it is by sifting through the grains of sand and finding specific games of this long gone system that we find a hugely underrated, and classic game in the wake of Jet Grind Radio. Featuring a cast of characters that never seems to get old and the continuous joy of tagging graffiti and running away from the police becomes increasingly more enjoyable as you collect graffit souls that open up newer and bigger tags. While I personally prefer the quicker pace of Future, don't let that fool you into tinking this game is not as enjoyable, it's just not as polished, and as quick paced. In this iteration, spray-painting is accomplished by doing motions on the controller similar to StreetFigthers fireball motions, etc. The music is as equally impressive as the visual style, which at the time of this games release was one of the original titles to featre cel-shading, a technique employed just recently to Capcom's Killer 7, with excellent results. Perhaps a game like this deserves to stay as an underground success, but it is unfortanate that we will probably never see a third game in this excellent series, after the lukewarm sales of JSRF. Oh well though, at least we've got the two games, but who knows maybe one day SmileBit will grace us with another excellent entry into this forgotten artistic masterpiece of a game."

1801395,B0065I114K,Used to like it more than I do now.,"Got two and they seem to work well but they need to be in deep boxes. They are pretty large and fat.Also, the 'old work' plastic boxes from HD or Lowes have ribbing on the inside that will stop the outlet from going in all the way. You will need to cut the ribbing out to make it work.Edit, after about two weeks of actual use:From four stars when I first received them to one star since the doors stopped working on both of them. They are really difficult to open. All this fiddling around defeats the purpose.Also, one USB port does not work anymore.These things are no good. Don't waste your time and money."

1365481,B000B6ML0U,Moronic at best,"This is a mostly dumb game.  If you can find it in a bargain bin then it may be worth the investment.  I like First Person Shooters, and was looking forward to this one.  However, I found it to be rather lame.  The graphics are only so-so.  Voice acting is terrible.  You can only hold at most three weapons at one time.Some of the levels are actually much better than others, so it isn't all bad.  Also, it is fun to play deathmatch.  However, I have only been able to get four levels on deathmatch.You can play with 15 bots which is fun.  Also there are some hovercraft thingees that are neat and don't run out of ammo.All in all, I am glad that the games on the 360 have improved.  If this was my first game I would probably trade in my 360 for something else.  I would suggest playing other games first and wait for this title to go down further in price.What I'd pay: $5.00 or less."

1411676,B0019C4MTI,SPORE CRAWLS ONTO NINTENDO'S HANDHELD,"Spore Creatures DS is an offshoot of the massively popular Spore for the PC.While it may not have the vast amount of editing options found it its PC counterpart, as a stand-alone game Spore for the ds contains a surprising amount of depth and enjoyment.The story starts out with you, a little creature called ""Oogie"" who barely managed to escape with his friend ""Little Oogie"" from the terrifying prospect of being beamed aboard an alien spaceship. The characters in the game act like paper doll cutouts. Remember in Paper Mario when Mario would turn around, it was like a piece of paper being flipped over? That's the effect being used here.Controls are very tight; you can use the stylus or d-pad to move around, and you use the stylus to interact with the environment.First you need to explore your surrounding area, to try to figure out where to go. Often the way is blocked by a cave, which may be unlocked by solving some story portion, or a body of water(in which case you'll need special legs to get through without dying) or even a boiling hot desert or bubbling lava and you have to find a way to safely get around or go through the hazards to the next area.Yes, the game can get a bit repetitious -finding a part to get to the next area- and in that respect, it can also be quite linear. However, I had so much fun finding new creatures to befriend to fill up my ""Sporopedia"", leveling up so I could use more body parts at once, and trying to find out the fate of Little Oogie. The developers did a great job of shaking things up a bit so the game play isn't too tedious and repetitious.Sometimes you'll have to race a character before he'll give up the leg part you'll need. Other times, it's as simple as saving a creature from a nest of nasties. If you clear the nest, either by befriending it or fighting all the nasties you gain a new nest which is often closer then the one you usually go to to evolve.The creature editor is surprisingly robust. At any time, you can head back to your nest and change shape. Add more eyes to see hidden objects, attach special ""water-walking"" legs so you won't drown in deep water, or stick on limbs that allow you to heal during battle. Early on in the game you will have the ability to burrow back to your nest, which makes it easier if you need to evolve to become stronger to fight a certain enemy.You spend your time making new friends, either by ""cuddling them"" which consists of petting with the stylus or via a rhythm mini game similar to a very basic Elite Beat Agents whereas you tap notes as they hit the center of flower ""rings"" to a beat. Or attacking other creatures that try to harm you, which you do by dodging around and slashing via the touch screen, and trying to find more and more body parts to use to ""evolve"" into a better, stronger creature.The game is also very aurally pleasing. It's got mild, soothing melodies that quite honestly I hardly even notice and each area has its own tune.One niggling concern: The camera can sometimes be a problem, constantly rotating around especially when you are trying to befriend or fight creatures. The camera tends to swing all the way around, so you are viewing from the other side, which can be off-putting. However, I never had much of a problem with it, as you can reset the camera using either of the L or R shoulder buttons.Replay value is incredible. You get achievement ""badges"" for defeating or befriending creatures, for discovering new places, for destroying or befriending all species of one creature, for finding parts, even little things like running though bushes or how much you feed your friends or evolve. These can then be spent to buy unlockable in-game cheats like invisibility or new, special body parts.You can can link up via local wireless and also exchange friend codes so you can trade your creatures with a friend. The idea behind this is that your friend's creatures can inhabit the game world as NPCs and vice-versa.To those on the fence about the game: You can download a demo of the game on the Nintendo Channel if you have a Wii and a ds. You can play around with the creature editor and walk him around a tiny island. On the Official Spore.com website they have a flash game where you can play with the editor."

3167921,B002OOWL3Y,Jackie Gleason was wrong,"Legendary comedian Jackie Gleason maintained that a good comedian could become a good actor. But a good actor could not become a good comedian.He was wrong. When Heather Locklear was added to the cast of Spin City, I was surprised. She had never done comedy before. I thought she was added to the cast because the TV ratings go up whenever she is added to a show. I also thought she was added to the show because she's the most beautiful woman on the planet. The producer of this show must of known something because Heather Locklear does  a tremendous job at comedy in this series. She basically takes over the show after a few episodes. Adding her to an already strong cast was a good move. I'm surprised she never did any more comedy after this series was off the air.Hopefully SHOUT will come out with the last two seasons of this series."

1836414,B000002KEI,Deep Purple's Classic 73' Release Is Finally Remastered!,"Released in March of 1973 this album was the last of the classic original Mark II lineup (until the mid-eighties) which included Ian Gillian, Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Roger Glover and Ian Paice. The album produced one hit in ""Woman From Tokyo"" but the album was full of great songs including ""Rat Bat Blue"", ""Smooth Dancer"", and ""Mary Long"", etc. During the recording of ""Who Do We Think We Are"" there were apparently ""intense personal differences"" that led to both Gillian and Glover leaving the band. This special remastered version includes seven never before released remixes, outtakes, etc. The sound quality of this remastered cd is excellent and superior to the earlier versions of this cd. There is also a 23 page booklet included which has some rare pictures of the band as well as information on the making of the album.  A true classic album that represents one of rocks most talented and loudest bands. Highly recommended!"

1505655,B007NL5CYS,The best pirate game since Sid Meier's Pirates.,"Leave it to Piranha Bytes to serve up a wholesome, open-world pirate-themed roleplaying game, the best in a long while -- one which, in practice, feels like a cross between Risen and Monkey Island 2. That's obviously a first, and it's great that they once again came up with something original. A contrasting, more pragmatic definition could be that it's a quintessential Caribbean adventure force-fed into the Risen setting for franchising purposes.Risen 2 came on the heels of the global success of Skyrim, which means that its timing was perfect. I'm not sure it was a conscious choice from Piranha Bytes though, who always struck me as a defiantly independent mind in the face of the ebbs and flows of a rather tyrannical games industry, focusing on one thing only: releasing deep, engrossing open-world games, one after the other, for the hardcore player. Let's see if they succeeded a fifth time:An immersive atmosphere. Piranha Bytes' forte, their enduring talent was always the evocation of a strong, distinctive mood, and Risen 2 is a roaring triumph in this respect. I don't even know how they do it, but every little place oozes a steamy, in-your-face, I'm-being-there tropical feel, complete with realistic weather effects and day-night cycling. What I always loved about their games is how they manage to infuse a gritty, naturalistic atmosphere with that of an enchanting fairy tale. As a result, Risen 2 feels like both how 17th century Caribbean drudgery must have felt like (cutthroats, schemes, sickness, danger and death on every corner), and how it lives on in our postmodern public consciousness: an idyllic, enchanted archipelago with its archetypal buccaneers, treasure chests and damsels in distress.An advanced engine. In fact, this is the most advanced graphics engine I've experienced yet. There's just something about it that eases the player into immersion from the word go. It must be the combination of its being optimized for mostly unrestricted free-roaming, a super-far viewing distance, and a pitch perfect rendition of geographical reliefs, bodies of water and vegetation. With some config file tweaking (as in Risen 1), viewing distance and the lushness of vegetation can be further advanced to a jaw-dropping extent.Freedom of exploration. This is what separates the men from the boys, so to speak, or the dedicated and generous world designers from the lazy, formula-following ones. Creating an open world clearly involves much more work and dedication. To me, there was always something special about open-world games, right back to 1987's original Pirates, or even 1984's Seven Cities of Gold. I feel that open-world RPG's transcend their genre and approximate to a real-world experience in a way no other entertainment product is capable of. Modern 3D open-world games are almost scary in this respect. At their very best, they are realistic adventure trips for $30 or less. And Risen 2 is among the very best.A streamlined crafting system. Piranha Bytes' games always required a high degree of micromanagement (of wearable gadgets, potion ingredients, blacksmithing parts and so on) which is the salt and pepper of open-world roleplaying games. Here they also introduce a 'pistol/musket' and a 'voodoo' system -- in concert with the 17th century Caribbean setting -- and get the corresponding micromanagement down to an art form. They became such experts in implementing this complex under-the-hood stuff that it feels seamlessly organic, a natural part of the game's fabric, unlike in several other games.HOWEVER, This is Piranha Bytes' first ""semi-open"" roleplaying game. I admit it was a minor shock when I first realized that completed areas get locked down -- at least for a while -- once we leave them. Gothic 1-2-3's main claim to fame was that they provided a single huge sandbox of a game area where every nook and cranny was physically accessible. Instead of a huge sandbox, they opt for multiple smaller sandboxes here: an interesting, fresh approach that does sacrifice some of the old magic of the Gothic entries and Risen 1.The studio's main weakness continues to be the somewhat banal characters, along with their cheesy names and especially their short, sketchy dialogs that get to the point too fast without any flourish or flair. Granted, there are a zillion sidequests, and the writers might feel that longer, better dialogs would overwhelm and distract the player, given this overabundance. But I think that being distracted and overwhelmed would be a good thing in this case. Hey, Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas got away with it. In fact, they are regarded the pinnacle of modern roleplaying games.Speaking of Skyrim, there is definitely much less than 100+ hours worth of material in here. Continuing with their new habit started with Risen 1, the game clocks in at around 40 hours, which disqualifies Risen 2 as a potential contender with the biggest boys of the genre.In a day and age when ambitious open-world roleplaying games come in scarcity, Risen 2 is an unlikely gift to the unhurried connoisseur. It is among the most atmospheric and evocative games ever produced, and it more or less does to a quasi-Caribbean setting what Skyrim did to a quasi-Scandinavian setting. In a perfect world, where a couple of sophisticated open-world RPG's would be released every year, we wouldn't normally ooh and aah at Risen 2 given its shortcomings. Alas, the world is imperfect, and Piranha Bytes are one of the last lions, so every one of their roars should be cherished and savoured."
1357438,B0007P0U3U,Addicting,"This game is simple to play and an ideal time waster.  It's very addicting because you are just determined to get that next high score.  The object of the game is to draw a line and make all the tiles white so that they will cancel each other out.  Similar to Tetris but a little different because of the way that you use the stylus and how you are able to draw the lines.  Extremely hard when you really get into the gameplay.  If you are easily frustrated with games, I wouldn't recommend getting this one, but if you like a challenge that involves puzzles.  Great for car rides, waiting in the doctors office, etc.  I like it!"
1464714,B003Q55Y5C,Will not run. No support. Waste of 7 bucks and 7 hours,"Installed game on Win7 64bit mid to high power rig. Took maybe 30 minutes for (f'ing) Steam to do whatever it is that Steam does(?). Launched game and it seized up and restarted my PC. Dbl clicking desktop icon or starting with Steam does the same thing- I get icon in tray, 10 seconds later mouse freezes, ten seconds later PC restarts. Tried again, same thing. So I dbl checked my video drivers up to date- yes. After like and hour I found the video software something said I needed. Still crashes. Downloaded DirectX and a few other things. Crashes. Spent hour after hour online trying everything sites suggested. Crashes. Reinstalled. Crashes. Went to game official site and pages not found including the latest patch page.... total waste of time. Absolutely no support and even official site seems like it's dead and gone. Some sites say go to Homefront.exe but it's so intermingled with Steam there is no such thing. I will NEVER buy another game from THQ or that uses Steam. I'd suggest you pass on this game if it were free."

1494398,B0056XXKIK,Deer Drive Legends,"I mostly got this game for my 10 year old son since he's the real gamer in our family.  I did play the game a couple of times and I think that will be enough for me.  I found it to be a bit dull and repetitive.  There weren't any kind of special features and really nothing that engaged me enough to want to play it any more.  There are a few &#34;brainless&#34; games that I like when I'm just sitting around watching tv, such as Death Worm on my iPad.  I would rank this game along those lines except that Death Worm was a budget app on my iPad, I didn't have to pay full price for it, and although I'm not really sure why, I don't mind playing from time to time.  Deer Drive just doesn't do that for me.  Apparently, it doesn't for my son either.  He says he's only played it once."

1319228,B00004ZDFY,Wtf happened Sony,"This game is absolutely horrendous.  You go back and forth to the same ugly looking dungeon looking for georama pieces.  On top of that he gets thirsty every 30 seconds and is sword breaks which makes it weaker.  Very very annoying.  What is up with the building of the town?  I want to play an RPG not sit there and build a town.  If I wanted to manage a town I would go play Sim City or something like that.  I bought this game a  while ago, and played for a total of about 2-3 hours before saying &quot;screw this&quot; and shelving it forever.  I recently bought a game called ICO, which is also made by Sony, now that is a masterpiece (Sony's redemption).  This is a horrible title, go buy ICO instead you'll be happier...trust me."
156538,B00C2HQWYC,Solid feel,Overall the feel is rather solid with nicely raised edges that look to provide drop protection at the corners and if it were to land face down.The back is plastic and protects the camera lens adequately. However this lets it slide across surfaces.The volume rocker is covered but the buttons are easy to depress (actually easier than if the phone didn't have a case).Overall if it weren't for the slippery back and the lack of covering for the ports this is a solid case for the price.

3671669,B00251EPL2,Sort of Worked for a While,"I have a 15-lb JRT who gulps down her food as quickly as possible every time she eats. This has led to unpleasant side effects such as her throwing up, passing gas, having diarrhea, etc. When we first got this, it seemed to help a bit. She still ate pretty fast, but it slowed her down some. As another reviewer mentioned, this is a pretty lightweight item, and she can scoot it around if she wants to with little to no effort. She has brought it to me a few times as a toy to play with, so that should give you an idea of how light it is. In the past week, I noticed she wasn't eating very much. I chalked it up to a recent weekend trip where someone must have given her people food, and figured she'd cave by the end of the week. By Sunday, however, she still wasn't eating. This is a dog that's serious about eating. She didn't seem otherwise ill, so I didn't know what to do. While puzzling over her lack of appetite, my husband proffered some food from his hand, which she eagerly gobbled up. Then, she sat up and barked at us, as if to say ""more!"" He poured her standard ration on the feeding mat placed under her bowls, and she promptly ate it all up. We have found out it's something to do with the bowl. After browsing the reviews here, I realized some reviewers said their poor doggie had scabs on their lips from trying to eat out of this bowl and was horrified. I checked hers very carefully, and while I couldn't find any scabs or open wounds, it all was a bit redder than usual and slightly irritated. We have since removed the bowl and she's back to her regular self. I would just be aware of the potential for irritation/wounds to occur when using this. I am not too terribly upset since she didn't suffer permanent or meaningful injury, but I DO think potential users should beware."
2358292,6305657939,Leave Masterpieces Alone!,"I have never been able to figure out Hollywood's thinking on remakes.This film is typical of what it does regarding making new filmsderived from films that have already been made.  It takes a movie thathas already been made perfectly, that had a wonderful script andtremendous star chemistry.  This describes the 1968 version of&quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; with the late Steve McQueen andFaye Dunaway. It proceeds to rewrite the script into a slap-happy&quot;feel good&quot; version for the masses and picks lead actors tostar in it whose talents are better suited to less-demanding made-fortelevision movies. This Pierce Brosnan-Renee Russo vehicle is ExhibitA of such thinking and also the raison d'tre why such perfect moviesfrom the past should be left alone.  If one wants to remake a movie,believe me, there are plenty of bad movies made from excellent novelsthat could be tried instead. Someone please remake &quot;Prince OfTides,&quot; for example.  Fortunately, the McQueen-Dunaway version of&quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; is also out on DVD and my adviceis that you buy or rent that 5 star version instead. The basic gist ofthe movie is that the consummate art thief and high flying risk taker,Thomas Crown, is pursued by a beautiful, successful woman bountyhunter for an insurance company that is eager to recover a paintingCrown stole.  The star chemistry and sizzle is more than half the funof the movie and the heroine is as strong and scheming a character asthe hero is--at least in the original version ..."

3543126,B00DJYJWVW,Missable,"This movie never seemed to settle on what it wanted to be. It connects the military/industrial (army/railroad) complex to criminal groups in a genocidal push against the American natives - kind of a big group of themes, and not really resolved by elimination of a few linchpin characters. There's the wise-cracking pair of good guys, but the wise-cracks seemed out of place amid the more somber notes. The Ranger/Tonto pairing never seemed to gel, and the horse (""Something wrong with that horse"") could have been more special or less, but came across as strange, but not strange enough for that touch of supernatural. The potential romance fizzled too.This could have been played for more ha-ha, and would have been better. It could have been more serious, and would have been better. It could have been more magically heroic, and would have been better. But, except for some memorable action sequences, it was too much of too much and not enough of anything.-- wiredweird"

2905347,B000I5Y8LO,Fans of the Guyver Will Love This Series,"If you love the Guyver, then you have to buy this volume. It only has four episodes, but it also includes special features and a 32 page book that tells a lot about the Guyver universe with pictures as well. The animation is amazing and the story is very interesting. It may not be as bloody as the original Anime series, but it is still worth buying just for the in-depth story alone. The acting is superb, even in English dub, it is incredible acting. I can't wait to have all seven volumes in my DVD collection! Well worth the wait and a must have for sure."

1722064,B000CC2KP4,"Very nice idea, poor implementation.","The idea behind this light is very nice, but because of a lack of quality in materials, the overall result has suffered.Features that I found particularly useful include the articulating head and tripod, which allow the flashlight to be set-up nearby for hands-free use. For example, I used this light for wiring a (floor level) receptacle in a room with little natural light (and no power), but because of the design, it can often be balanced even where there may not be a flat surface. I have had little use for the variable light intensity, and although I have not ""used"" the low battery indicator, this appears to be a good feature. Similarly, the ""parallel energy cell technology,"" which apparently allows function on only three batteries, appears to be a very nice feature.Nevertheless, still in new condition, one of the plastic caps that secure the battery compartments fell off and would not thread securely back onto the metal legs. These caps are made of low quality plastic with a relatively low precision, so they do not thread securely onto the tripod legs. A second of these caps cracked after the light was dropped. These facts exemplify an important weak point in the quality of the construction of this product, one that has already been foreseen by at least one reviewer. If purchasing such a light, it seems worth considering Stanley's 95-115 and 95-146, which appear to have metal bands around the aforementioned caps. Although I have not seen these lights, the bands may have partially solved the aforementioned problem. I have not investigated the lighting quality and/or quantity of these other products."
1356239,B0006DNN00,Not a bad game,"The game isn't THAT bad. I decided to use a couple of bucks just too see if this was nearly as bad as people are saying and it isn't, they are honestly being Dragon Ball (canon) fanboys. I actually loved GT and they might not know it but Akira actually helped with GT. lol I guess they were basically calling his ideas lame, uninspired, cheap, and that SSJ4 was a let down. I am 17 and have always loved Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT and I swear that either they are kids posting this or they literally know nothing of Akira Toriyama's work... This generation of kids is.. Weird.. What with the whole ""graphics mean everything and all"" I know I am young too but I still enjoy my GBA and PS2.... :P Anyways, the game is fun, it has pretty good graphics for a GBA game, but it does have some glitches though. Not to worry, the glitches don't ruin gameplay, it makes it funny, cool and better actually. xD Also, if you want my honest opinion on what the best Dragon Ball game is for GBA, it is Supersonic Warriors hands down!! Try that one out while your at it too! :)"

1862388,B000084T18,The Best Album in a LONG time!,"I purchased this CD with very high expectations. After all, 50 has been ruling the mixtape circuit, released several bangin underground joints as well as the classic How to rob, has a dope flow, witty lines, crafty lyricism, and can write a deep song with a catchy hook as well as freestyle with the best of them. Now that Dre and Eminem are involved, I expected a very solid album, but I would have NEVER expected the absolute masterpiece that ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" truly is!Each track on the CD is worthy of it's on review:WHAT UP GANGSTA: Tpyical into track. 50 showcases his gift for writing a catchy hook, and it's good to see him working with a dope underground producer like Reef, who laces 50 with a dope beatPATIENTLY WAITING: The only reason 50 shouldn't release this as his next single is because he would run the risk of being upstaged by Eminem, who steals the show on this track both with an incredible verse ( ""Shady records was 80 seconds away from the towers/those cowards messed with the wrong buildings, they meant to hit ours""), and a menacing sting/piano beat that just plods along. Not to be outdone, 50 also shines on the track with his tale of struggling to get onMANY MEN: 50 telling of haters who want to bring him down. This is actually a rather deep track and showcases what seperates 50 from the rest of the pack: his ability to spill his soul.IN DA CLUB: This song has already been tearing up radio stations, clubs, and now car systems everywhere. You will NOT find a song catchier than this one. Big up to DR. Dre on the crazy beat.HIGH ALL THE TIME: 50 blends his brashness (""I can battle Nas and Jigga BOTH for the throne"") and a dope Digga beat to create a phat track to either smoke or ride toHEAT: This is 50's ode to guns. The sheer rage in 50's voice combined with the way he blends crafty lyricism and threats to haters really show why 50 is so dope. However, Dr. Dre provides an INCREDIBLE track with actual gunshots for the beat!IF I CAN'T: This track should be the next single. Dre hooks 50 up with ANOTHER blazin' track and 50 rips it up with yet another crazy hook in the middleBLOOD HOUND: 50 and his G-unit partner Young Buck create a rediculous flow that fits's Sean Blazes uptempo track perfectly.BACK DOWN: This is the track that will have people talking for a long time. Over another hot Dr. Dre beat (notice a trend here?) 50 cent totally destroys Ja Rule and is quick to point out Ja's lack of street cred as well as the fact he can't stand on his own two (""Jay brought you up, X made you hot""). What really takes the cake is the guy at the end who claims to be Ja's ""Boo."" A classic track!P.I.M.P.: If it wasn't for the subject matter, this too could have been the next single. Denaun Porter laces 50 with a funky carribean beat and 50 destroys it with his ode to pimping. WHile it's an old subject, 50's charisma and flow make the track a sure winner.LIKE MY STYLE: Rockwilder shows up to provide 50 with a simplistic, yet very dope beat and 50 again rips it up with a Jay-Z type Braggidagio complete with a dope hook.POOR LITTLE RICH: Sha Money XL provides the kind of beat the shows why he was 50's main underground producer on this one: Blazin' Hot! 50 raps about his ""Rags to Riches"" story with (guess what) another hot hook!21 QUESTIONS: May also be a future single. Nate Doog appears on this one over a radio friendly track by producer Dirty Swift. THis is a deeper song comosed entirely by 21 questions that 50 askes to his boo. It's incredible that he does this in verse form! And who says 50 isn't a songwriter?DON'T PUSH ME: Eminem and Lloyd Banks share the light with 50 while all 3 shine while warning foes to stay away. Em's beat allows the MC's to flow crazy over this beat, and they do not dissapoint.GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN: Megahertz creates a CRAZY beat over which 50 writes a deep song how he ""has to make it to heaven for going through hell"". Similar concept to Raekwon's ""Heaven and Hell"", but just as dope.Just for icing on the cake, 50 adds 3 bonus cuts: the hit ""Wanksta"", ""U not like me"", and ""Life's on the line"", all very dope.In conclusion, I am Amazed! Not one weak cut! Outstanding production the whole way through thanks to Dre, Em, Megahertz, Denaun etc, and 50 showing why he is the most complete MC in the game right now: flow, lyricism, battling, deep songs, catchy hooks, and charisma that won't quit. This is the best CD in a long time, even compared to Nas's ""God's Son"", Jay's ""Blueprint 2"" and Scarface's ""THe Fix"". This will go down as a classic! GET THIS CD RIGHT NOW!!!!!"

1850230,B00000J2RG,Ross &amp; Chic,"Diana Ross was no stranger to disco music with the disco hit &quot;Love Hangover&quot; and the album The Boss, but on diana she joined forces with one of the most formidable disco production teams, Nile Rogers &amp; Bernard Edwards of Chic.  Instead of making another disco album, Rogers &amp; Edwards moved away from a heavy disco element into a funk &amp; rock sound that created the edgiest and most creative album Ms. Ross has ever made.  &quot;Upside Down&quot; is the perfect synthesis of the sound. The producers lay a funky guitar riff over a string section while Ms. Ross purrs away with sass and style.  After this release, Ms. Ross moved back into more familiar territory with such songs as &quot;Endless Love&quot;, &quot;It's My Turn&quot; and other more traditional Diana Ross sounds.  But on diana, she created an original, innovative and edgy record that has held up better than most albums from this era."

1848114,B00000BKJ1,Solid CD,"Faithless is a band from the UK that is becoming more well-known these days because of Dido. Her brother, Rollo, is the leader of this group along with Maxi Jazz and Sister Bliss. Sunday 8pm is a great listen all the way through with the highlight being the track, God Is a DJ. This is an unbelievable track that would get anyone dancing. Dido's song, &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot;, is used in Postcards, which is one of the best tracks. She also sings on Hem of His Garment. Even Boy George guest vocals on this CD singing on Why Go? The Garden and Killer's Lullaby are other outstanding tracks. If you like techno/electronica music and especially Massive Attack as well as Dido, then you need to buy this CD."

3492959,B00A8305MW,I Bought All of It Because I Love It,"I already reviewed boxset 1 of this. I can't add much more to it... I basically reviewed all of it over on the first boxset.Let me give you the reasons to watch this: Bad-ass main boy who is thirteen, slightly built, and doesn't have a girly voice, a lot of the main girls kick ass as well, including a loli dominatrix who already has one slave (and about 3 or four by the end of season 2), the music in this boxset (the ending theme) is probably my favorite song from the series (although I love the season 2 ed theme too... so hard to pick between them), it has TONS of fanservice, the powers are different and the way they get them is even better (by sucking out holy breast milk), and, even though he has a lot of girls that like him, they don't all throw themselves at him, he actually CHOOSES a girl whole-heartedly by the end of this boxset, and it's funny every now and then, dramatic, and just dark enough to keep you loving it. It's refreshing to see an anime like this when you're tired of Girls Bravo and To Love Ru, and the like. Watch it online uncensored before buying. If you don't watch it uncensored, most of the screen will be blocked out, and unwatchable."
3749138,B000JFJLP6,Very nice product,"You can tell from the details it is a quality product.

You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies.

1806819,B0081JT7LK,Ridiculously complicated installation,"Just how much money did 3M save by not fully assembling this product?  And how many man-hours are being wasted by their customers trying to put these things together?Hard hats are a commodity.  You can pick one up at any big box store (Home Depot, Lowes, etc.).  I like the idea of saving a few bucks by buying one online, but the result is a ridiculously complicated experience.Here's a tip for 3M:  Field guys don't have the reading skills (in any language) to follow your complicated instructions.  And while the office guys may or may not have the reading skills to comprehend the instructions, they generally lack the time and patience to read the microscopic directions printed on the bag.  Maybe someone in HR or Safety could assemble them (especially since they're the ones who mandated the hard hats), but time is money and it would be easier and cheaper to buy fully assembled hard hats somewhere else.On the plus side, this is a nice clean looking hard hat.  It's plain white with no markings on the sides, so it's very easy to apply company logo stickers to complete the uniform.  And once assembled, this is a fairly comfortable and easily adjustable hard hat.  Not worth the hassle though."

292322,B0012Q6M6M,Expensive piece of junk,"I'm not sure if the scale is even accurate but the rest is pure junk.

Then after you use it once and enter all the height, age etc. it's all lost. The next time you try it everything is lost and it goes back to default readings. It's total crap. If the scale is accurate that is all you are getting. The rest is crap. Like I said, it won't keep your settings. I don't know why Amazon has the nerve to show a bunch of 5 star reviews when there are as many 1 stars. If you like programing it every time you use it and then jump on in 12 seconds I guess you may like it or you are just plain stupid."

1303441,B007T8CUNG,Is This Thing On?,"Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. I still own most of these units except for this one...the JoYo compressor. My setup is a very simple one...starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them. This thing simply didn't work right out of the box. While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China. Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. I ended up sending it back for a full refund. I don't in anyway blame the seller. They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again...just nothing with the name JoYo on it. If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for."

3614112,B0006NEGOC,My dog rates it a 5 and she's the boss,"The only thing I was disappointed by was the lining. It is very scratchy and rough and not soft at all. I expected it to be soft and fuzzy.I have a chihuahua and she is 9 years old and weighs maybe 10 lbs. Normally when you buy a small dog bed they are extremely small so I expected this one to be, as well. I was pleasantly surprised. The bed is big enough to hold 4 full sized chihuahuas. The size makes up for the rough material on the inside because I was able to stuff a microfiber throw into the bed which I uploaded a pic of (mostly just to show off how cute my dog is).I love chihuahuas and Bridgette is my 3rd chihuahua. All of mine have been lap dogs and extremely cuddly. They love to nest up with a soft blanket. B loves the cave design. She just had to have teeth removed and the bed arrived on that same day. She loved it right from the beginning. She loves having her own little space and crawling up inside of the cave to keep warm.I would for sure recommend this for chihuahuas. This is just about perfect. The outside material is a thick canvas and it has more than enough padding.The price is more than I've ever paid for a dog bed but I realize that I would rather buy one really nice bed that will last the rest of her life than to buy several generic, cheap ones every year.I give it 5 stars easily because my dog is so happy with it."

What makes it so funny is that he is a deep underground head.  So I took his work for it and got this album.  Big mistake.  Real hip-hop heads know DMX 1st album is his best work.  After &quot;Its Dark and Hell is Hot&quot; was dropped it has been all downhill for DMX.  His previous two albums were average.  Nothing compared to his 1st.  Its sad to say becaue I thought &quot;And Then There Was X&quot; was the worst DMX could possibly ever put it, I was wrong.  This album is pure garbage, subpar beats with well below garbage lyrics.  You can tell from the intro that DMX spent about a day on this album, seriously.  If you dont believe me check it out.  I gave it two stars because the firs track is pretty hot."

1818763,B00F4AVRGW,Great Quality Tools for the Money,"The 170 piece Crescent CTK170CMP2 Mechanics Tool Set is the perfect gift for a college aged kid just getting ready to strike out on their own. Just throw in a good quality claw hammer and their all set for tools for many years to come.I was very pleased and I must say a little bit surprised at the quality of these tools. I have bought several similar sets of tools over the past 40 years and invariably ended up disappointing in the fit and finish of the the set.These Crescent tools are well made. They come in a blow molded plastic case that holds them all snugly and securely. The mechanical &#34;works&#34; of the ratchets have a very solid &#34;professional&#34; feel and there is no &#34;play&#34; in the connections. While the shafts on the combination wrenches are a little shorter than normal that is great for this type of set, since they need to fit in the case and the applications they would most likely be use for often include cramped spaces like engine compartments and plumbing crawl spaces.There is a good mix of SAE and metric sizes to cover most jobs you're likely to come across. While these tools are probably not the kind of thing professional mechanics would be looking for, homeowners, students and other DIY types can't go wrong."
1137159,B00CZP8ZJG,"Retro 80's Arcade style game with promise, but lacks key essentials and content","First, let me say that I'm happy to see that this has NO problematic permissions, NO IAP, and isn't a terribly bad game.  Even the &#34;Facebook&#34; stuff doesn't actually force you to do anything except close your browser after it opens.If the game had any instructions whatsoever, then it would certainly get another star.  If this game had instructions and cost 99-cents, then it would be a 4-star game in my opinion.GAME: The game is an 8-bit 80's arcade style game. The graphics, music, and sound effects do an excellent job of recreating the late 1980's arcade style.  As a child of the 80's arcades, I can vouch that this is well considered!However, many people will find the music and the sounds annoying, and the only way to turn them down is to use the device's master volume controls.PLAY:You start out with the note &#34;Slam to Play&#34;, then you die instantly.  Turns out that are constantly bouncing and you have to tilt your device to avoid hitting the flying orange things from the bottom.  Different things appear on the screen at different times, and you're either supposed to touch them, land on them, or avoid them.  Unfortunately, you really don't have any idea what you are supposed to do.It turns out that you are supposed to bounce higher and higher to collect coins above. If you touch the screen while falling you 'slam' down harder, which depletes a little of the slam meter. This isn't too bad, but you only have ONE LIFE!  You die, game over.  Rather annoying!The game offers in-game coins (NOT IAP!) for power-ups, upgrades, new characters, and even new playing fields. But it takes WAAAAY too long to collect coins to purchase stuff.  There is an offer for 100 free coins if you like them. But it doesn't have access to Facebook, which means all you have to do is tap the button, let your browser launch, close your browser, and you'll have your 100 free coins.CONCLUSION:The game's developer is off to a good start.  But there are a lot of improvements that need to be made before this game is a successful business offering.  I consider it &#34;BETA&#34;, seeming more like a demo than a full game.  Still, it would be worth 99-cents in my opinion, especially if there were promised improvements coming down at some point.SUMMARY: Not worth $2, but worth 99-cents.  Needs instructions, easier coin earning, more lives, and sound controls.  Dev off to a good start, but not ready for commercial release; needs more to it."

They told me that they would mail me the right bottle. I am very short of time due to my hours and didn't want to buy a big bottle when I had the right ones comming.  They have NEVER arrived yet and it's been a couple of mos. I have never been forced to write a bad review about anyone I have ever dealt with from Amazon until now."
1519890,B00BBU8VFY,Great Console,"This Console and bundle is a good buy. It was an upgrade from the original Xbox. The original Xbox had an external Wifi adapter and it was expensive, nearly a 1/3 of the price of this bundle at some stores, this console has a built in Wifi adapter and comes with new controller and two games. Runs great. Definitely a good buy if your in the market."
2913880,B000JLQPYK,"Suffers from history, and a horrible legacy","I watched the original shows. What was great was you never new when they were going to break the Government Censorship Anti-Freedom of speech laws. They always threatened to go over the idiotic lines the prudes had drawn. And I thank them for that. But these do not age very well in general. They are pretty light weight in retrospect. With few exceptions (Bill Murray) the stars developed instant enormous egos not commensurate with their talents as subsequent movie disasters have proved. Saturday Night went straight downhill from here and that's why the very negative review. At least at the start their targets were appropriate, the powerful, the arrogant. Now they frequently target the weak and infirm. The show is less than funny, its embarrassingly horrible. The music in the first was on the edge, frequently underground and deserving wider exposure. They were brave in doing that. Now the music is CPA Product approved corporate garbage designed for the lowest common denominator. Its really sad an horrible what happened. Lorne Michaels should be ashamed of his greedy immoral self."

1440174,B002I0GEXM,intense,"Make no mistake about it, this is a GREAT game. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is intuitive, it's *very* challenging and will get your heart pumping.However, it's not for the casual gamer or someone who likes to sit in front of their Wii and play a few rounds of mini-games or brain teasers.I'm a huge Disney fanatic, and an artist, so when I heard about this title I counted down the days until it was released. I figured it would be something we could play together as a family, and include my 5 year old daughter in the process. However, the game is not only intense, it's really *hard*! I don't know if it's because I'm not your typical gamer (I've never played a ""point and shoot"" game and enjoyed it) or just because I'm bad at multi-tasking during a game (trying to aim my Wiimote and make the right motion while trying to navigate a jump and stay away from a giant mechanical drill coming at poor Mickey) but this game is probably the most challenging Wii title I'm willing to play.And, poor Mickey is not exactly treated well in the game, which might be a little jarring for smaller kids or people who find the Disney characters too beloved and sacred to imagine in precarious situations. My 5-year -ld isn't a delicate flower by any definition, but some of the situations might freak her out so I'll probably play when she's not around. Epic Mickey is not a fun-filled and thrilling virtual visit to Magic Kingdom, it's actually a serious game with depth.If it weren't for my love of Disney, and the novelty of painting everything, I probably wouldn't put Epic Mickey back into the Wii. But I'll keep playing, and work on my skills and remain in awe of everything that is so beautiful about this game."

This is perfect for him, all around the knee cooling for him, Front, back and sides and pressure can be applied by tightening the straps. He is very happy that he has a smart wife who looks out for him and he loves the knee wrap too!"
1297268,B0002ZO3LK,Good for light weight stuff,I tried it for iPad. It kinda wobbles up and down. It has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my iPad.  I only recommend it for something light weight.  There's better ones out there. See my review on the music stand. That comes with a solid extension arm...

I see that it is ""contructed of rugged ABS plastic"" but mistakenly thought ""pad"" meant it would have at least some sort of softness to it. This plastic contruction makes it slide around in the dogloo, which is easily solved with a piece of scrap carpet placed underneath. However it doesnt solve the problem of no padding at all. It emits a pleasing heat when laid on, but my dog would rather lay on a soft cold dog bed than a heated piece of hard plastic, even with a thin covering on it. There is not enough heat to transfer through a comfortable pad placed on top of it. I am returning this and getting the ""soft outdoor bed"" of the same brand instead."

1519105,B00B1MXGDO,Never ever buy Razer again.,"*Note if you only want to hear about the sabertooth reviewing skip to ""Third and final"" paragraph.**Also most 1 star reviews usually will be skipped by customers simply because they think its usually that one person that gets the bad apple...This is my third official Razer product. It is ALSO my third product to be defective. I got a gaming mouse from razer, the Habu, it freaked out and made my pointer fly all across the place. This happened with another laser mouse, needless to say I went to optical, and recently a bluetrack microsoft mouse which I HIGHLY recommend if you are in the market for an exceptional mouse.Ok I got the first razer product out of the way. My second Razer product was in fact the Onza tournament edition (360 controller). I had to snip the cord and replaced him about 3 separate times while dealing with Razer support. They at least allowed me to that many times.*Third and final review, this one. The Sabertooth was the last bastion of hope for Razer. I told myself after purchasing, that if this one were defective, I would never buy another Razer product and God as my witness, I will not. Not if my life even depended on it. So what happened with this one you ask? Simply put, an exact month of use goes by, no less the length of the warranty I might add... It works like a breeze. Digital ""sensitivity"" control eliminates those hard to turn knobs sensitivity from the Onza's. Plus and minuses to that which I think led to my Sabertooth freaking out. The ""flat"" design being implimented to the triggers like the Microsoft stock controller eliminated the ANNOYING curved ones on the Onza. That's two steps in the right direction. The two shoulder programmable buttons were made smaller to be able to distinguish from RB and LB. WOW Razer you might have done it...the third times a charm myth might actually prove solid. Now to hit rock bottom, landing back on planet Earth... it freaked out after a month into use. By me using the thumbsticks to move, my character would suddenly ""spazz"" out sort of like my Habu gaming mouse did. It would decide not to respond like when I turn left direction, it basically would not turn my character left. My only reasoning is the digital sensitivity tweaking was causing the malfunction. I used the digital sensitivity like twice though. Non the less, as soon as I saw signs of it being defective, I quickly appealed to amazon and asked how and if they could help me as far as a return or credit for return. Amazon of course was amazing and allowed a refund. I thank you amazon.com for being an amazon-ing (amazing + amazon...haha) site! I wish you, Razer, would fall of the face of the Earth because if you do, GOOD RIDDANCE!"

1668533,B008SYVF3Q,Traditional coarse French grey sea salt,"This coarse French grey sea salt is the genuine salt used every day at French tables:  it is harvested from the Gu&eacute;rande salt pools in Britanny much as it has been for over a thousand years and it carries the Nature & Progr&egrave;s certification.  This particular product is superior in taste and appearance to the run-of-the-mill sea salt that comes in tall canisters at the grocery store.The natural coloring and complex mineral flavor is a result of the sea water from which it comes as well as from the clay soil that forms the evaporation pools.  It is very good for everyday use and after using a good sea salt like this, it is difficult to go back to a pure and flavorless salt for use at the table.  It will make plain dishes such as poached eggs and baked potatoes especially flavorful and is very good sprinkled on tomato juice as well.For those who are restricting sodium intake, consider using a salt such as this one to get the most pleasure out of the limited salt that is used at the table.A sample was provided by San Francisco Salt Company for unbiased review."

She already loves laser pointers in general whereas my other cat is terrified of them.One critique I have is that the dot does not seem as prominent as most handheld laser pointers. It couldn't be because of the mirror since that just reflects like directly so I am wondering if it is a full 5mW beam. It looks more like 3mW."

Bought a two pack because it was the best deal economically but it hasn't worked for me and now I'm unable to return 2nd bottle because it's too late but had no way of knowing it's quality until giving it a reasonable try. Would not buy again.  Very disappointed. Have had to resort back to sleeping pills because this failed to live up to what was advertised. I thought the time release would be a step up and better but it's not. The regular melatonin worked better.  Upset that I cant return the 2nd bottle. It's useless to me!  Wasn't a bargain or good deal afterall.

1793368,B004Y6V5CI,Seems to be a quality product,"I did a lot of reading on all the different type of CO1 detectors offered here on Amazon. I chose this model not only for my own home, but also for the customers I install CO1 units into their homes (I'm a contractor). This is not the cheapest model available and the same company makes one without the digital readout which is less expensive, but I believe it's worth the extra money to have the readout. That way, I feel that if there is a problem, it may be caught sooner than later if the amount of emissions are listed. This unit is guaranteed to last seven years as opposed to the other model without the readout at five years. It's one place I would not want to cut corners. I also prefer the types that are mounted at eye level and not into an outlet."

This game had all of our heroes from Super Mario Bros 2: Mario is balanced, Luigi can jump high, Peach can hover, and Toad can run faster. This game had new hard and intense boss battles, hard levels, hard green star locations, similar power ups like fire flower, super leaf, and super boomerang,similar enemies like Chargin Chuck from Super Mario World, and new characters. This game is awesome and addicted, so I gave this game 5 stars."

Luckily, while on my trip I notice the back drivers side tire was low. A Tire Company I took the motor home to check why the tire was low, took it off and showed me that the ends of the extensions were crushed and causing the problem.  They checked the tire by submerging it into a water tank and there was nothing wrong with the tire  Had them remove the extensions and didn't have any more problems on 4K mile trip."

It's very hard to pinpoint exactly what it smells like, but it's definitely different. It does not necessarily hinder the good taste of Aloe Gloe, but it's something to be aware of before trying it.The drink is smooth and sweet. It's fairly light and goes down smoothly.I admire Aloe Gloe for sourcing their ingredients in the U.S. and producing their drinks in California, without comprising and having the customer pay an absurd amount. For the low calorie & sugar intake, healthy nutritional value, you're getting an aloe vera drink that is priced reasonably. Definitely consider this brand."

1369270,B000E6NF5M,Keepsake was disappointing,"I had great hopes when I began this game. It was advertised as an adventure game with puzzles to solve. Not only were the puzzles so obscure, but it was impossible to determine a sequence of events with which to proceed.  I found myself going to the internet for hint after hint. Another detriment to the game was the endless transporting from one area to another. To solve a puzzle, you would have to go through three or four transports only to be forced to go to another area involving a lot of movement.  Truthfully, I got to the point where I only wanted to game to end.I have to say this was a totally unsatisfying game experience and would not recommend it to anyone."

He needs to save himself the embarassment.

The problem is to use them as a metronome you have to push a small multifunction button to switch to metronome function, then press smaller buttons to set the speed of the metronome.  I find them annoying.This metronome can be set with one hand by simply turning it on and twisting a dial.  The speed is easy to read and setting the loudness of the metronome clicks is easily changed.  And there are two clicks to choose from.  The metronome has a flashing light too.Overall a very useable metronome.5 stars."

Got the coat in the mail, it is really really cute, and my husband LOVED the pockets, thought it was really funny having pockets on a dog coat! The size on the other hand it off. It looked small so I tried it on my 12lb cat first and I had to squeeze her fat rolls so it would close, I knew then it would not fit the pig. I did put it on the pig anyway's just for comical relief! Reminded me of the movie tommy boy, &#34;Fat pig in a little coat.&#34; Anyway's its a pain in the A$$ to return stuff,  and I love the colors, quality, and style of this coat so I just ordered it again in a large.

2419952,B00003CXR3,CROUCHING TIGER UN-HIDDEN SUBTITLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was expecting so much out of this movie because of all the hype following it. I am an avid reader and do not normally mind subtitled movies (ie.. Pan's Labyrinth and Kung-Fu Hustle.. BTW, Kung-Fu Hustle is LOTS OF FUN!) but there were PARAGRAPH AFTER PARAGRAPH, NOT SENTENCES, OF DIALOG.. FAR TOO MANY SUBTITLES GOING ON AND ON FOREVER, AND GOING BY QUICKLY, that I could not figure out who was who or what was what in this movie. I lost the plot in the first half hour. I was so busy trying to read that my contacts kept drying out and I could not enjoy anything else going on in the film. If you're a martial arts purist, maybe you would enjoy it more than myself. Also, maybe I could have enjoyed it more dubbed in English."

2244724,6303122647,Elfman and Burton's Finest Partnership,"Tim Burton is one of only a few creative minds who's able to handle creepy, adult material in a way that's not just appropriate, but also downright appealing, to younger audiences. Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Edward Scissorhands are all great examples of this trait at play, but of the lot I think this is his most timeless creation - which is odd, since it's the only one he didn't direct. Like the very best fairy tales, it's adventurous and unusual, taking outlandish concepts for granted as a means of sucking the audience into its own private corridor. The plot is predictable and natural, but also doesn't sacrifice its ability to throw the audience for a loop from time to time, and efficiently straddles two holidays in a manner that never feels forced or exploitative. Of course, the visuals are remarkable, bubbling with character, but the music is where it really hangs its hat. Danny Elfman has never felt more naturally at-home in the Burton universe, and considering the pair's long, storied history together, that's quite the achievement. The tunes are occasionally just a bit too catchy for their own good (I've been humming them for the better part of a day now) but that's a small price to pay for a modern fable this good."
1392565,B000SH3XEK,"Good game, but could have layed some more smackdown.","I've been a fan of THQ's wrestling games since WCW/NWO Revenge on the Nintendo 64. I still say to this day, they have not been able to top WWF No Mercy (N64) but this game here is my favorite so far of all the ""Smackdown Vs Raw"" titles. It's probably because it was the first one I played, so I got used to the controls of this version in comparison to just about every version of the game changing the control systems. I just wish more had been re-included in this game, as seen in previous games when it comes to backstage areas.2008 has a much easier control system, to me anyway, making use of the PS control pads buttons as well as the analog sticks. It is very easy to get used to, and there is no crossing fingers over or a need to press two of the regular buttons (X,O,Sq,Tri) at the same time. Your direction/walking is preformed with the left analog. And moves are preformed depending on which way you toggle the right analog stick. Holding down the shoulder L1 button will make you run, and holding down the right shoulder button will aid you in doing a more powerful move than just using the right analog on its own. Also the buttons aid to pick up and drop weapons, irish whip and various other things depending on what match your are in.Just about any type of match up you want is in this game. From one on one, being able to customize the rules to whatever you want; one fall, various falls, time limits, rope break on/off, DQ, falls count anywhere etc... to tag, trio, survivor series, various on various, special guest referee etc.. as well as matches like Cage, Chamber, Hell In a Cell, Tables, Ladders, TLC, Extreme Rules etc.. about the only thing not here is a scaffold match or pyramid, which is something WWE has never done anyway.What I find is a nice addition is little hotspots, like in the corner of the ring, or the middle of the ropes where you can just drag your opponent to it and execute moves that the game doesnt tell you are there. You can pummel your opponents head into the turnbuckles, choke them on the ropes, give their privates a seeing to by the turnbuckle pole ... and these get better outside the ring in certain areas where you can ram your opponents head into electrical equipment and watch them explode across the screen.I really like backstage areas, THQ finally managed to implicate it into No Mercy with 5 areas you could get backstage... however, that is not found in this game unfortunatly. Which is a shame, because they did a great job with it on the first three Smackdown games for PS2. But, this one does have a cool little parking lot brawl, however the downfall is you can not turn KO off, so the matches do not last long. However they have included an area in the top right of the arena when playing hardcore or no count out matches where there is a variety of weapons, tables and objects you can have fun with, as well as a huge scaffold to climb and splash a laying opponent through a table.There are 3 types of modes you can play when not playing exhibition matches. There is 24/7 mode where you choose a wrestler and play with them through each day of the week for as many months as you can be bothered playing. You will get story lines and cut scenes and what not along the way, you can train, do events and try to earn money and popularity. This would be great if load times where much quicker and useless cut scenes could be turned off. They load for too long, and get quite annoying. Sometimes the load screens feel like they take longer to get through than it takes you to win a match. The music and superstar info screens they show during the loading screens will drive you nuts by the time you've reached Wrestlemania. Plus the cut scenes most of the time are useless... you just wanna get in the ring and wrestle, and instead you see the same cut scenes a million times which take time to load them, then you skip, and another load screen before you match. Big downfall in the game there.The next mode is tournament... you can choose what events you wanna do, or create one... mostly you will probably choose king of the ring. The next is hall of fame mode... there is a bunch of matches to choose, the first being 1995, where it explains HBK entered the Royal Rumble at #1 and done it... now you go and try and do it on the hardest mode. This is also where you unlock guys like Austin, The Rock, Mick Foley, Bret Hart etc.. you enter the match and compete in the match about them, Austin you play as Bret Hart and try and make him tap, The Rock you play as Austin and just try to beat him at Wrestlemania, Foley you play as Undertaker in a Hell In A Cell... the rest of the modes are things you have to try and achieve in 24/7 mode. The annoying thing is you HAVE to play 24/7 mode to earn money. There is no other way. THEN once you have enough money you can PURCHASE the legends in the WWE Shop after you have beaten them in legend mode. What is annoying about it is you get about $3000 per victory, and you need about $210,000 to unlock Austin, then another $210,000 for The Rock and so forth.Create a Wrestler mode is cool, they always are. However they seem to have been dodgy with the create a moves list. They have this system in place where you have to choose what sort of wrestler you are; Showman, Dirty, Hardcore, High Flyer etc... and this measures what type of moves you have access to. Which is not how I like it. If I wanna be able to do a choke-slam and a hurricanrana in my move sets, I should be allowed to, and not told because I am in this class, I can't do those moves. It is stupid. Plus, there seems to be many moves that have not been included in this game, compared to what has been included in previous games.Anyway, thats enough reading, I could go on with more, but you're probably bored by now.Overall  : 3.5 StarsGraphics  : 3/5Sound  : 3/5Commentary  : 3/5 (tho becomes annoying as heck because it repeats itself so much, till you call it a -5/5)Controls  : 5/524/7 Mode  : 2/5Exhibition  : 5/5Tournament  : 3/5Hall of Fame  : 3/5Creations  : 3/5John Cena  : 0/5Bret Hart  : 5/5Loading Times :-10/5"

171614,B00E0L42LI,bubbles are us,"I've never been good at putting on these darn things.  This pack came with 3 because they know that I'm a idiot and would need at least that many in the first place.  The first one installed with ease but some dust go under it, just one speck, but was a enough to drive me nuts.  I took it off and trashed it.  I found that they have little strips that you can use to take dust off if you get them.  The 2nd one went down and sure enough I got two specks of dust with resultant bubbles.  I used the strips to clear off the dust and they left two more... 2nd one in the trash.  Third one when down without a dust speck or bubble.  got luck on that.Summary:  Works if you have a clean room to install them.  The results are good and the touch screen works just as good with this on without tinting the screen."
2172553,6301977270,Vincent Price knocks 'em dead!,"Vincent Price is Edward Lionheart, an aging and failed Shakesperean actor who is driven to the edge (of a building) when he is denied a vaunted stage-critics award in this darkly hilarious classic.  Thought dead after an apparent suicide attempt witnessed by that circle of persnicketty critics - including the late-great Robert Morley - Lionheart survives and returns to exact a cruel revenge on his &quot;enemies&quot;.  Using an actor's mastery of disguise and improvisation, and knowing of his enemies weaknesses, Lionheart takes each critic out one by one.  Resorting to ever elaborate means of murder - each suggested by works of Shakespeare - Lionheart deprives the British stage of one critic at a time, outwitting the surviving critics and the team of crack detectives sent to protect them.  If you're thinking &quot;waituminit - this is like one of those 'Phibes&quot; movies, you're not off the mark.  Unlike either of the Phibes movies, &quot;Blood&quot; is set in present day (okay, the 1970's!!) London and adds heaping spoonfuls of funky - witness Price as an afro-coiffed hair stylist!!  And speaking of spoonfuls, I'm not even going to say explicitly what devilish and ironic end he saves for Morley's corpulent character.  (The beauty of this flick is that you know what's going to happen - it's like a slow-mo car wreck).  Between this flick, the Hammer films and &quot;Psychomania&quot;, my (then) young mind envisioned London as a city of monsters and psychotics in love with its reputation for the macabre - no less enjoyable because I actually caught this movie while vacationing there.  If you're a Price fan, or are just in the mood for some acid-tipped fun, this is your flick."
1302332,B004FRHKA2,Great Product,"I've gotten a number of these Joyo and Artec pedals now, most from Earth City Sound(TX, mostly on eBay these days) though I recommend this seller on prompt delivery but don't happen to know much about them otherwise.I got this one on a whim just to have a second delay. I've had the DigiTech X-Series multi-delay for many years. The fun thing this Joyo does besides standard adjustable delay is that it makes crazy UFO, sci-fi-ish sounds. All one has to do is get a note or feed back going and simply experiment with noise by tweaking the knobs. Guitarists who are fans of Yo La Tengo and similar groups, spacey stuff will dig this box. Solid hardware, side mount ac power. Goofy graphics of an eagle though I imagine by now they've updated it's look."

I do think you need to make the ramp longer and and not so  straight down it would help it takes her awhile to get up but she does it,,,,,I had to put a no slip sand paper down on the ramp for her... And the sucky cups on side do not work ,,,,but I love it she has the whole tank now to swim in and she is big , I did put a screen and the tank for she can't get out so I can put the water high..

1452572,B00309U0M6,"Sweet, but first one was better","This game is awesome, but it's not as good as the first one.  There's some good new weapons while still having the old ones.  Same with the enemies.  It's basically the same game just expanded a little bit, which is a very good thing for part 2 and maybe part 3.  However, the story doesn't add anything new.The big questions from part one weren't answered.  The characters are great and the writing is good, but the big picture is avoided.  I'm a little worried that the series might just end up being several isolated incidents with a survivor fighting his way out.  I'd like to see the story filled out and explain the origins and purpose of everything.But story aside, this is a great action game.  My only other complaints are lack of bosses and mini games.  The first game had a shooting gallery, zero-g basketball, and the turret scenes, which helped to change things up a bit.  Maybe other people didn't like them, but they were kind of optional.  And the first game had more and better bosses.  Anyhow this game is pretty cool."
1649040,B005BPVB9S,"Yum, chocolate!","I am pregnant, so I am trying to eat as healthy as I can for the baby. When I saw this, I thought it would be a great snack for me to snack on at work when I get my chocolate cravings. They are very chocolatey, almost reminds me of the cereal coco pebbles but more bitter chocolate taste than sweet, an adult version. I get a touch of the cinnamon taste as well in each bite. I like them, easy to eat the bag in one sitting if you are not careful though.I was a little weary of sesame seeds and chocolate but it I like the combination. Although, on the front of the bag it shows a lot more sesame seeds on a crisp than it really is in the bag. Actually the front of the bag makes the crisps almost unappealing because at first glance it looks like meat instead of crispy thins, especially with the sesame seeds on it. But, you can't judge a book by its cover because once you open it up and get a whiff of the chocolate and start eating it, any thoughts of meat are gone.It is 46 pieces per serving and it has about 6 serving in it. 120 calories, 4g fat, 30 mg sodium, 9g sugar."
3741644,B0000ATZD5,Decent lock for under $10,"I'm using this to secure the spare tire on my utility trailer. It has a nice thick cable and it's not too long like a bicycle cable lock. Tubular locks are not my favorite, but overall this device seems like a pretty good deterrent for the casual thief. I did notice that the ring on one end of the cable was drilled out way off center. Maybe not the best quality control? (See it in the pic I posted.) I'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend it without hesitation."
3742435,B0002MA3P8,Good Deal,"I'm using these as DRL, and they are perfect for that use.  Very good quality, great installation gear, and they look nice.  I am going to replace the bulbs with LEDs to cut down on current draw."
294948,B0013OQL0U,Rash,"Not long after taking my first capsule, I developed a terrible itchy rash on my back and it's traveling to shoulders. I also experienced extreme nausea. Haven't had time to do a lot of research on the subject of green tea causing allergies yet  but it seems to be a distinct possibility. This is happening as I'm writing this.If green tea tends to make you nauseous as it does me, don't bother buying this. As for the rash, it had to be this supplement so beware."
3637232,B000NVDEY0,Cute!,"Cute and sturdy dog toy, a squeaker in each leg which my Mastiff makes his goal to remove. Then he carries around the remains. Nothing cuter than a massive dog with a silly toy. He's a powerful chewer so it never lasts long because he rips it apart, but for the average dog it would probably last very well."
1300631,B001Q8DJO4,Priced Great and Sound Very Good Too,I am not a fussy person about guitar strings.  They either sound good or they don't to you and you are the one that matters.  I was very pleased with getting 3 sets at this price delivered to my front door.  There are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside.  Martin is at the top of the heap.  These strings sound light and bright. Very pleased with this purchase.
2451520,B000053V7P,Bird it a great flight to take back to the 50's.,Clint Eastwood is not only a great actor he is a great producer and director. This is a wonderful entertaining movie which depicts the essence of Charlie Bird Parker and his tragic life. Very artsy and well put together. I highly recommend it.
1298970,B000OY4WDI,The engineers at Boss should be ashamed of themselves,"I bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage.  I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28, but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.Imagine my profound disappointment.Really, Boss??? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours.  This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the ""Top"" control higher than about 9 o'clock.  At first I thought I must have a defective unit, but then I started reading reviews on-line.  Seems like it is part of the design. It's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. Totally unusable, as far as I'm concerned. By the way, I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat)."

3673960,B0029NVJ4M,Cats go CRAZY for these!,"These are really great treats. We buy them by the case, since you're supposed to feed 10 treats a day for medicinal purposes. If we skip a few days, the cats get hairballs again almost immediately, so these really seem to work as intended. The best part is, the cats go nuts for them. All you have to do is crinkle the bag and they come running. They make a really great training tool as well. We have used these treats to teach our kitties everything from &#34;Fetch&#34; to &#34;BANG! Play Dead.&#34; For the price, these treats can't be beat!"
2884918,B000G1R4TS,Oh what a disappointment!,"Tom Fontana is a remarkable and imaginative writer but he really slipped on the final series of Oz. A huge fan, I eagerly purchased the entire series 1 to 6 and have watched them from beginning to end loving each minute. Until, that is, series 6. What happened? Why do I get the feeling that Tom, knowing this to be his last series, got a 10 year old to write it for him? Where in the previous seasons he had managed to get in a hint of something and build up on it weeks or even a series later, everything is disjointed, nothing is explained and a mismash of ideas obviously planned for the next 2 or 3 seasons are thrown together in a poor imitation of the star writing of before.Series 6 is a bit like eating a divine cake and savouring each minute to taking a bite at the end and finding someone didnt stir in the lemon flavouring!As disappointed as I am in this series I can still give the others 5 stars in every respect from writing to acting and Oz will remain in my memory as one of the best TV series ever."

1294123,B0002CZV78,Been part of my rig since 1996,"I bought this little pedal back in 1996, about a year after I got my first guitar.  I've tried other pedals, but ultimately, this one gives me the best sound.  It's very versatile and it's really easy to dial in just about any sound I want.  You might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units, but for cost and practicality, this pedal is your best bet!"

3610423,B000634JP8,Kitty doesn't like,"This is a nice shelf, stylistically. I bought it to replace an older, crummier one that's seen lots of use and better days. However, when I first saw the thick egg-crate style padding that makes up the cushioned portion of this shelf, I had  doubts that my cat would appreciate it. She's not the type to lay on a pillow or a couch cushion or anything else that is fluffy. Unfortunately my doubts have so far been confirmed. She will not stay there when I put her there, nor will she use it on her own. I've put treats there to lure her, but she'll reach her paw over from the old shelf to the new shelf and pull the treats closer so that she doesn't actually have to step on it. In a moment of craftiness, I cut a piece of cardboard to size and slipped it in under the cover to firm it up. She still won't use it. The shelf's cover is too large to use without the included padding. Another negative note: one of the support legs doesn't sit flush to the wall and this causes the shelf to wobble. Because of its being ""glued"" to the window ledge by the adhesive strip, I'm hesitant to remove the shelf and damage the sill. I've tried manually adjusting the support but can't seem to bend it the way it needs to bend. I can stuff something into this extra space to firm it up, but that detracts from the shelves appearance in the living area and causes an otherwise 'classy' looking shelf to take on a junky air. Too bad, I would've liked to see the old one go."
3747706,B000DZBP60,An expensive alternative to spray cans,"I bought this to spray colored stain but tried it out with oil based enamel paint first.  Had to thin the enamel (rustoleum) 30-40% before it would spray properly.  Yes, this works with thin materials close to the viscosity of water.  Good finish, minimal overspray, easy application.  Next I tried a latex stain.  Even after it was thinned 50-60% it would not spray well.  Totally useless for this material.  Water clean up required a lot of scrubbing because the paint that gets in the air passages ends up being blow dried.  I'm glad I have less than $55 into mine because its not worth the retail price.  Buy spray cans instead, no clean up and less expensive."
1471177,B0044TD9HY,AMAZING!,"I've always loved Rockstar's games because of the free-roam and physics, but the experience was ruined by a boatload of sexual crap, and every other word being an F. But now with this standalone game of undead nightmare, they laid back a lot. In fact, besides some references and a little more gore 'cause of the zombies, there's nothing sexual in it, and that's what I love most about this game, I can enjoy it, finally!"
1618613,B003GTR8IO,Better than Melitta,"This is actually a pretty good vanilla coffee, but the coffee base is much milder than what I prefer - I like my coffee strong. This, however, is so you can taste the vanilla better. When compared to the Melitta vanilla coffee (which was also offered on Vine), this one wins hands down. The vanilla in the starbucks coffee is much milder than the melitta version which allows you to enjoy the coffee itself rather than being overpowered by the vanilla. Overall, if you are looking for a mild, yet well flavored, vanilla coffee, this is a very good choice."
891358,B008KP6ENE,Really fun and cute,This game is so cute and really addictive. The controls are so simple and the levels are quick. And you really can't beat the price. I mean $.99 for a great game when other horrible games are $4.99. This is definitely one to buy both kids and adults will enjoy this one. Excellent!
3601087,B0002DIO2G,not worth it,"Just go to WalMart and buy the SmartyKat - cheaper, faster and BETTER!!  Can't believe we waited almost TWO WEEKS to get this junk -it is so IMpotent, both cats couldn't care less for it!"
1700766,B000066B50,"Poor Implementation, should have fixed by now","I gave this product one star only because I couldn't select ""zero"" stars.  The idea is not a bad idea, just poorly implemented.  Despite reading several reviewers' reports that these clamps easily broke, I ordered them anyway since they looked like a solution to a common problem and I expected that the defect would have been fixed by now.  Wrong!  Without actually seeing the clamps, it may be hard to understand how they are made.  There is a polycarbonate ""base"" with two ""spring steel ""clamps"" attached via a separate polycarbonate ""lid"" which is screwed on.  The lid is not strong enough to hold the clamps leading to stressing (bending) of the lid and potential failure.  I did not actually use the clamps.  One clamp looked ""okay"" in that the polycarbonate lid was not obviously stressed and deformed.  The same was not true for the second clamp.  I'm sure it would have failed the first time I used it.  So, I returned the clamps to Amazon for credit which they did give.  For awhile, I thought about remaking the polycarbonate lid out of something more substantial, thicker, or stronger, like aluminum.  The lid is secured to the base via screws so this may have been possible.  But, why should I have to do this, especially when I really would have to buy three more sets to use on any four sided box?  At $10 per set, maybe I would have done this.  But not at $25 per set!  The manufacturing fix would have been at least to make the lid thicker.  I usually read most of the reviews with a grain of salt and discount some where I think maybe the user was at fault.  Here, I was at fault for not listening to other users.  Conclusion:  Good idea, bad design/manufacturing.  It really should have been fixed by now."
1422392,B001MW3TS0,Busted,"I feel a little guilty about my desire to complain about something that cost so little, but the truth must be heard. It does the job of a controller just fine.  My major complaint was the vibration.  When triggered by the game the controller would not stop vibrating.  It must be unplugged then plugged back in and disabling that feature on the game.  The buttons are labled with some standard scribble but the colors are right.  Overall not unhappy I bought it.  It was fun not caring about throwing it across the room.  in the end like with everything in life.  You get what you pay for."
169291,B00DPIJRK8,Case For Extended Battery....Broke With One Drop On A Linoleum (not concrete) Floor,"I have had my Samsung Stratosphere for about a year. I used regular batteries until our 3G service became a 4G service where my battery power was drained much more quickly. I recently purchased an extended battery and a new back panel comes with the battery because the size of the battery is larger and you would not be able to close the back with the back panel that comes with the phone. Sadly the really nice TPU cases seem to be under the complete control of Apple (as usual) and there seems to be no one to manufacture and sell the soft TPU Gel Cases for any product but iPhones (go into Best Buy...There is whole aisles devoted to iphone cases and one black case for my phone). Yes you can buy those crappy hard plastic snap on covers with as non slip feel but nothing else. I thought that when you got the extended battery your selection would go down to zero except for the back panel that comes with the extended battery.I originally found the same cover from Verizon (through Amazon) which was about ten to eleven dollars plus shipping. Then I found this one which is made by Samsung for Five dollars and change with free 2 day shipping through my Prime Membership..When it arrived I originally thought that it snapped on over the extended back panel but there were no directions to verify because it would not fit. I was ready to contact the seller, when I realized that it WAS what I originally thought..It REPLACES the battery door that comes with the extended battery door and the front part snaps on to the front of the phone. Then there is the holster which guys or girls that wear belts can clip the phone onto the belt or you can clip the phone onto your purse strap etc.... When you put the phone in the holster it goes with the screen toward the inside. It also has a fold away easel back so you can stand the phone up. So in short, this not a case. It replaces the original back cover that came ON the phone when you bought it. When you get the extended battery. it is larger than the basic battery and therefore with the larger battery in place the back will no longer clip on. The title states that this is an extended shell.It seems to have a sturdy rubber plaid pattern  which doesn't look bad and the whole unit does not look cheap like some do. Of course it still is not the very protective TPU and there are no fashion colors for me, but at this point I'll take what I can get!!!I gave it 5 stars because it is what they say it is and it works well and appears well made. It would not be fair to take away stars because it it only basic black. THAT is a battle for another day!!!2/2/13 UPDATE ON REVIEW... My phone was dropped on a linoleum type floor and the clips on back cover broke, rendering the back panel useless. So glad I remembered where I put the back that came with the battery. I drop the stars to ONE STAR!!!"

8399,B001SEAOC6,Where art thou Nokia,"Oh Boy, where do I start a review for this product.I saw this product on Sale at Dell website and overly impressed with the specs and the reviews on Amazon - almost immediately I ordered one for myself and just about to order another one for my wife.  I put it on hold till I try out one of them - glad that I did not order the 2nd one.Initially I did not like the idea of going for a $30 data plan with At&t; and being stuck to a service provider for 2 long years and badly wanted to buy something with no data plan.Let me break down each of the feature functionality of this product in detail - it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product.  First the good part and then the bad stuffAs a phone - receive/make calls  :  10/10===============================Full marks to Nokia as a phone - the phone has excellent signal reception, compared to any of the smart phones out there in the market.  I have used a blackberry/iphone/samsung and Nokia score above allCamera (stills) : 5/10===============Camera is good for outdoors, but very poor for indoors - the photos look very grainy.  Front camera is decent and you can use it to make video calls with your friends running fring on their iPhone/Android and other nokiaCamera (video) : 7/10===============Video quality is excellent, I have shot a few videos outdoors and almost compares to HD qualityCamera/Video/Front/Rear switch : 2/10==============================Since the phone feature video, stills, front & rear camera: Switching from a video to still and back to video.  Switching from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and non-intuitive.  I am a pretty good geek with stuff and I found it extremely difficult and confusing to switch between different modes.Calender, Memo... : 5/10======================Can sync with Exchange on your computer, but cannot sync directly with exchange servers unlike android/iphones which can directly connect to your company servers.  Which means, everytime, you need to connect the phone to the computer for syncMusic player/Video : 7/10==================Music player output is very good, lacks a audio book player.  It does not playback divx movies (sorry torrent folks :)Youtube playback: 2/10================Ok, I thought I will be able to use this to play youtube videos to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving.  I was not able to play even a single youtube video without pauses and jerks, made several attempts and finally gave up.Read on the forums and some suggested me to use the desktop version & try it on wifi - But even on Wifi, while it is better than 2g/3g - it is still disgusting playback speed.I was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback partYahoo/Gmail access : 3/10==================Imagine that you open a mail and it comes up as  new mail  &lt;href image= ....>This phone does not even support html emails, no images either.  Other than that, the good part is that it does a pretty good job of syncing with Gmail & Yahoo and downloads the emailsKeyboard  : 7/10=========The keyboard was a bit impressive - you have 3 options - mini keyboard, full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting.  I liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.Apps  : 2/10====Yes, there is an app store, but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.Next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity, but if you have used any android/iPhone app - you will realize that Nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.Touch Screen: 3/10=====================First of all this is a resistive touch screen, means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work, unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.So the Nokia's resistive touch screen works, but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesRadio : 3/10======It does have a radio, but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna.  Even after plugging in the antenna, it picks up a few strong signals, but did not pick up some of the weaker signals neither indoors, nor outdoors.GPS  ; 4/10====I have a 3 year old GPS from garmin and I thought I will throw it out after I get a Nokia.  Oh oh, big mistake.  The Nokia phone comes with a assisted GPS (means it does triangulation with satellites as well as with cell phone towers.While the phone does a good job of finding your current location, it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street names and directions.  It works, but it is no where near to a regular GPS or a built in GPS like the ones in iphone/android=========== summary =============Honestly, I have never felt this frustrated with any phone in my life- when I really wanted to love this so much.Nokia - where art thou ? come down from your ivory tours and give us a good phone.  We do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of At&t; and apple - we want unlocked phones and we do not want to see crappy phones like this from you.  Pls wake up."

1766477,B0026T1EXK,Not the best quality and there are better options out there,"Bought this and a pull bar for installing about 1000 sq ft of snap together laminate. Doesn't feel like something that would last for more than a couple hundred sq ft. I wouldn't know because I started using trim pieces of the laminate as my hitting blocks because this tapping block did not feel like it should be hit on.If I could do it over again I'd take the money spent on this and buy a higher quality pull bar, as the Lowes one I had barely lasted the 1000 sq ft, but was much more necessary. And I'd still use the trim pieces as my hitting blocks because you could cut a dozen of them and never have to get up and walk across the room to get your tapping block again."

1298313,B000EEJF4O,"Great conditioner, better than lemon oil","I have a gibson les paul that I bought used. When it arrived the fretboard was in good shape, but very dry. I first tried lemon oil and it would work, but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it (its rosewood). So I started looking for another solution and found the Gerlitz Guitar honey.I ordered it and applied it.  A few hours later I restrung my guitar and started playing and didn't care for the way the fretboard felt. I think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn't completely dry. I decided to give it another 24 hours.The next day the guitar neck looked and played great. It is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ. Bends and slides are smoother than ever.Great product and one that I will continue to use. If you need a quick treatment before a gig or something, I would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly. But I would use this in every other regular maintenance situation."
1873271,B000EGDAQG,"Oakenfold Fans, Save Your Money","Paul Oakenfold himself is a legend of club music. Dj, Producer, Remixer. He does it all. His remix albums are the most famous though, Oakenfold has remixed some of the greatest club songs around and always seem to do a great job in the studio. ""A Lively Mind"" however, is his second collaboration album where famous musicians appear on new songs. On ""Bunkka"" he already did it, 4 years ago. It wasn't a complete success back then but some songs like ""Starry Eye Surprise"" became hits with lots of airplay. On this album he continues with the same thing but there are perhaps even better artists this time like Pharell, Grand Mater Flash, Spitfire and Brittany Murphy! yeah the actress. So, Where does this project measure up?It is a nice album with some very satisfying dance music and probably a few floorfillers in the summer, Oakenfold is still a very talented dj and his producer skills are not bad. Having said that ""A Lively Mind"" is hardly revolutional, ""Bunkka"" wasn't that good in 2002 and this new album 4 years later isn't much better other then for occasional songs. The problem is that Oakenfold in not doing the next big thing anymore and he doesn't get the maximum of the artists he used. There is too much rock oriented artists around for my taste, Ryan Tedders ""The Way I Feel"" for example sound more like a remix of a rock song and it's defenitely not going to be something that people dance or sing along to, ditto with Spitfire's ""No Compromise"" and while it's fun to hear Brittany Murphy sing, her song ""Faster Kill Pussycat"" sound like it would have came out in 2001. There are good songs though, but it leads to the other problem. ""Sex and Money"" with Pharell and ""Set It off"" with Hip Hop legend Grand Master Flash only used sound loops their voices, come on now! You got Flash here and he only get's to say ""Wazz Up Paul""? A total waste. Bad Apples ""Vulnerable"" is slightly better with great guitar riffs and a dreamy feeling. There's also some traditional instrumentals to play save. ""Praise The Lord"" is good, perhaps my favorite and ""Save the Last Dance For Me"" aswell.As a whole, this album is a dissapointment though, Paul is one of a kind and got so much talent inside of his mind and when he eventually decided to record a studio album without remixes but personal compositions you could expect a better result. There are some good songs but it's far from the ""Next big thing"" anymore. Ironically, the 2 best songs that are both 5 star songs are the 2 instrumentals without guest artists!. But othern then that this is far from the best Oakenfold has been making. Save your money, but get the instrumentals."

3310095,B004Q2TWPW,Personal preferences will probably be a major factor when responding to this disc,"This recording of La Traviata, made at the Royal Opera on two dates in 2009, is essentially a traditional production and features a top calibre cast under the expert baton of Antonio Pappano. The production by Richard Eyre, slightly re-vamped, is essentially the same as that recorded for Gheorghui's first recording with Solti conducting in 1994 and regularly revived ever since.The current recording provides a particularly strong characterisation of Giorgio Germont given by Thomas Hampson. He has the maturity for the part while still retaining the strength of voice which gives this difficult role the required authority, although morally doubtful, that can often descend to mere bullying. This is a notable portrayal and one good reason for considering this recording.The next good reason is the musically satisfying portrayal of Alfredo by Joseph Calleja. He voice has the tonal characteristics that blend well with those of Fleming and together they make a convincing vocal partnership.Renee Fleming reprises the role she made just a few years earlier with Villazon and she demonstrates a rather more emotionally developed portrayal of the role. Although of more mature years than that of the role she has nevertheless retained an astonishing level of youthfulness and beauty in her personal appearance that reduces the obvious age gap between herself and Alfredo to a remarkable degree. Her voice has a creaminess that is very attractive and she is able to act the role well and it is in that respect that, in my opinion, she demonstrates the development over her earlier portrayal with Villazon.The orchestra responding to the inspiration and guidance of Pappano has made enormous improvements over the years and now is second to none. On this recording there is a thrilling intensity and forward momentum to the performance that is typical of Pappano's expert operatic grip.The recording is very good and is typical of the high standards that one might have come to expect of Opus Arte. The camera work is involving and provides sharp imaging. The sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo options of good range and definition.There is a 21 minute bonus feature in the form of an interview between Pappano and Fleming as well as the usual cast gallery.In summary this is a well-performed and recorded traditional production of La Traviata. Interpretively there are no special insights offered, but just a good old fashioned honest delivery of a popular opera. Technically this is a good and reliable product which apparently aims to satisfy a traditional middle-of-the-road audience. There is nothing wrong with any of this and I personally find this altogether more satisfying than watching a performance or production that is essentially more self-aware than Verdi probably intended.Finally, how does this compare? Beyond the resume given above I can only answer for myself of course. For me personally the main issue revolves around Violetta and here I find that Renee Fleming acts this really rather well, as well as anyone. But ... and here we have it ... for me she is still acting and it is with Angela Gheorghiu that one finds something quite different. With Gheorghiu you actually experience someone who actually becomes Violetta. Her first recording with Solti clearly has youth on its side but the older Gheorghiu on the later recording with Maazel at La Scala has everything else including Blu-ray and budget price.On a purely objective basis, this ROH offering can be described as a very good production and well recorded. Those who warm more to Fleming will probably prefer her in the role in either of the two productions currently available. Conversely those who warm to Gheorghui will probably prefer her as in either of her two discs. In the end there are personal choices to be made based more on subjective preferences rather than objective measurements. Any of these four discs (two by both Fleming and Gheorghiu) will probably give equal satisfaction to different purchasers and this review can only be considered as an overall guide to those choices.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one.

3757812,B00480FIBE,Osram Nightbreaker is better!,"First of all, there is a slight difference in light output, whiter than normal. But to get that whiter look your gonna have to go to the 5000K diamond vision range which turn out to be illegal here in Australia (best to check on your local laws) the beam output length is the same as OEM, and this becomes shorter as you go whiter in light. These lights are pretty much for looks, although whiter light has more clarity, you sacrifice beam length for whiter light intensity. HID however are the opposite.It is true what people have said about the life of these bulbs. THEY HAVE NONE! Think of your normal OEM bulb, then reduce the life of that bulb by 75%, that is pretty much all you can expect out of these. Don't be surprised if they blow after going over bumps in the road. I've been experimenting with a few bulbs out there, Although Phillips do make very good long life bulbs in the 3300k light offering 120% longer beam, these whiter bulbs (4000k - 6000K) just don't last and will end up costing you a fortune in replacements.Osram Bulbs are much more durable from what I have found. still on my first set of OSRAM Nightbreaker Unlimited, Have lasted me 8 months and they do have a 20% whiter light rating.Lets get serious. If you really crave that white light for your car, research HID xenon kits. I know the white light is cool, but be sensible and kind to your back pocket unless you have cash to burn."

2433603,B00004CYNF,Classic Film,"This has over the years really become a cult object, and though it is today by many considered a classic, its notorious history still hasn't come to an end, as the availability of the film is very limited, and there seem to be various edited versions in screen time and screen size. I saw a widescreen version with washed-out colors, which was a bit cut I believe.Nevertheless the power and vision of this film came through my 16:9 TV screen and I experienced enough of its magic to glimpse its greatness.The film was made as an underground project in the Mexico of the late 60s, and had difficulty finding distributors, probably because Jodorowsky had already caused a scandal with his previous film ""Fando y Lis"" in 1967 which was (reportedly after a notorious run in Mexican cinemas, where numerous fights broke out over it) banned by the Mexican government. This film too has in time become a cult object all over the world, and is available on DVD in the US along with an audio commentary by Jodorowsky himself and a documentary on its making. Though I haven't seen it yet myself, I don't think fans of surreal films would be disappointed if they took a chance with it. Because all of this Jodorowsky had difficulties with El Topo, but after John Lennon urged a friend to buy distribution rights, it got a world wide release and was heralded all over the world for its weirdness and strange philosophical take. If one considers a statement by Jodorowsky where he said that he asks of film what most North Americans ask of psychedelic drugs, one can see why the hippie-generation all over the world got enthusiastic about it. But while for example a film like ""2001 - A space Odyssey"" (which also got a lot of negative press on its original release, and commercial success through stoned audiences) became later regarded as a great cinematic achievement, El Topo hasn't yet gotten the same academic ""beatification"", for better or for worse.So a modern viewer commonly approaches it not expecting a demanding work of art, but more something along the lines of 70s pseudo-intellectual Eurotrash, spiced with some gore and sex scenes.I must confess, that this was also my own approch, when I borrowed it from a local videostore, but I was soon to be disabused.The film features Jodorowsky himself as the main character El Topo, a gunslinger in search of himself. At the beginning he has a young son with him, but he leaves him alone in a village after finding a woman who is willing to accompany him on his travels. From this point on things start to go downwards for him, as the woman stirs up his ambitions to become something. On his search for fame and money he becomes more and more unscrupulous killing and torturing people, and even aquiring a second wife. The mission he finds himself on is a mixture of a spiritual search and a killing spree, on which he has to find four master gunmen of the desert (each with a personal philosophical stance) which he wants to defeat. After completing his task (not in an honest way that is), he is left alone in the desert to die by the two women who have apparently bscome a couple.After this many a viewer (and critic) would have liked the film to end, but Jodorowsky is more interested in his philosophical vision, and the expression of a humanist view of the world, and adds a final chapter to this film, which is imo crucial for its understanding and the overall quality of the film. In the last part (which is the strongest) El Topo awakes in a cave where he has been worshipped for many years as a saint who is going to rescue the clan of deformed outcasts living there. Felling guilty of his former sins, he starts digging a tunnel, to connect the cave with the outer world, represented by a nearby town. Here Jodorowsky gets deeply allegorical and crafts a pessimistic commentary about the state of things in present day Mexico. I'll only tell, that in the following El Topo encounters his son, and that the union of all people is a task that can't be easily completed. The ending shows a bit hope for the human race as a whole, though it is far away from happy. It personally reminded me of the end of Jean Renoirs ""La grande illusion"", with whom the director shares his love for the common people and his ambivalent belief in and love of mankind, though both know what horrible things it is capable of.But above all the films quality rests in its subversive take on film and society, which has put many viewers of, and is also the most responsible factor for the films strange reputation.Jodorowsky uses elements from all over the world, mixing western and eastern philosophies, using film styles as different as the western and the slapstick comedy (where Jodorowskys knowledge of film history gleams), and dialogues and a use of language that seem to come from everywhere. The use of camera-angles contrasts beautiful panoramas with repulsive stagings of human decadence, and from gore to sex scenes, to a lrelationship between a dwarf and a ""normal"" person, there seem to be few topics the film doesn't have something to say about. But this eclectisicm isn't just a show-off, but at the very center of the films whole concept.As a whole the only satisfying comparison I found, would be to Glauber Rocha's brazilian masterpiece ""Black God, white Devil"" (which was - made in '64 - surely a huge influence), with added philosophical grounding.Jodorowsky has afterwards made only a handful of films (some also classics), but with this film alone he has left an important mark in film history."

1376728,B000GC5V1U,What can I say? I love that friggin Nail Gun...,"As a huge fan of the original FEAR, Extraction Point didn't need too many bells & whistles to get my attention. I loved the atmosphere, the visuals, sound, AI, guns... All very satisfying. The story was decent for a video game, but I read a book or movie when I want a good story. Games don't usually deliver for me in that category.Extraction Point, like most have said, is more of what you liked about the original. The developers weren't very daring. They really didn't add much to the story, and they left the gameplay  formula alone. 2 or 3 new types of bad guys- cool. Some new locales... sweet. The 2 new guns were very nice, but as someone else said, the ammo is scarce, which is a shame. It would have been a lot of fun to go on a total rampage with both of those guns for a decent stretch of time. For instance... one of my favorite game-moments was near the end of Half-life 2, when you have nothing except the super-charged gravity gun, and you are just going absolutely berserk with it. FEAR needs moments like that.This expansion was brief, which some have complained about. It took me like 5 or 6 hours on medium, and that fit the bill nicely. Admittedly, I may have a shorter attention span then some, but I was satisfied.Another thing that some have complained about is the system requirements. FEAR looked gorgeous and played very smoothly on my puter. Here, they ramped up output, and I had a pretty tough time tweaking it. This actually frustrated me until I checked online, and discovered that it wasn't just me. It picked a level of settings for me, and it looked real nice, but when a little action hit the screen, the game stuttered horribly. I had to sacrifice quite a bit of eye candy, to be able to make this game play well. Expansions don't usually challenge your system that much more than the original game.Anyway... I am a big fan of that nail gun, and I was pleased to wield it once more. This game should have probably been priced a little cheaper for what they give you, but at least you can resell it!"

Second, I have 30 humanity, and the gold serpent ring which gives me 410 item discovery rate(yes people, it stops at 410)and in 10 times, killing those 3 clams, I got 3 purging stones. Died on purpose so I wouldn't have to run all the way back. On the way back with no humanity and only 300 item discovery rate, and 2 times killing those 3 clams I got 6 purging stones. Something's not right here. I'm getting way more drops with less item discovery than I am with it! This game is NOT hard like everyone says, it's just tedious and it does everything in it's power to cheat you out of things. I'm one of those people that loves to grind, but this game totally ruins the concept of grinding and makes it not fun to do-period. This game is NOT hard!

1340710,B00008H2IS,Soul Calibur II for Game Cube has a cool character Link but is not that good,"Soul Calibur II for Game Cube is a button-mashing fighting game that is adored by non-gamers and despised by gamers.  The story mode is the worst story mode of any fighter, in which you fight the same characters over and over across a long map of dungeons and areas.  It is more busywork than it is fun.  The moves are executed through button-mashing, with the exception of a few throws that each character has.  Only my non-gamer friends like to play this game as it only involves button-mashing and not actual skill.  I let them beat me at this game whenever I have parties and invite them over because to win at this game would mean I have to play this game with my entire group of non-gaming friends.  Of course, I can win because my hand is something like 100 times faster than their hands or more and I, thus, can button-mash much faster than them, clobbering their characters one by one until my arms and hands are buffed out with my veins popping out.  Plus, I enjoy seeing their astonished faces when they beat me because they know that I am an actual gamer.  It is glorious in that they feel like that they can accomplish anything now since they accomplished such an incredible feat in beating me.  My true gamer friends despise this game.  All in all, Link is well-designed in 3D and can whoop any other character's butt, especially after he gets the fairy sword; however, that's not enough to keep the game interesting for gamers but non-gamers seem to adore it."

Reordered another because it is the only one to fit my battery and it caused my phone to lapse during calls because it made the battery unstable. The replacement ripped the volume button off my phone. Very very unhappy.
1306907,B00000K4MC,Grab Some Popcorn and Take a Ride on the Roller Coaster!,"Anyone who has an old computer like mine (6 years old), knows it is getting harder and harder to find quality games that will fit your system.  Roller Coaster Tycoon's minimum requirements are only 16 MB RAM, a CD ROM Drive speed of 4x and 50 MB of free hard drive space, so it works great even on my obsolete system.  What is more, it is a fun game!  The first simulation game I became familiar with was Theme Hospital and, since I enjoyed that game so much, I decided to switch from the hospital beds and psychiatry couches to the roller coasters and concession stands.  Theme Hospital was a little easier to learn.  At first, I could not figure out how to get the rides up and running, but the tutorial soon set me straight.  Now I am having hours of fun with this game.This game allows you to do all kinds of things.  You can build a variety of rides from the kiddie ones (haunted house, curly slide, carousel, Ferris wheel) to scary, complex roller coasters.  You can even name the rides!  The roller coasters can come pre-made or, when you get more advanced, you can design your own.  There are also a variety of concession stands to build including a burger place, soft drink stand, balloon stand, popcorn, pizza, french fries, you name it!  Different scenery can be chosen too, including those with a Greek, Roman, or Egyptian theme to really give your park character. As you play the game, new rides, scenery, and concession stands will be introduced.  Each time I play, I discover something new!  You also get to hire maintenance men, handymen, security guards, and entertainers (guys dressed up like pandas, elephants, or tigers). You do not have to baby-sit the game as much as Theme Hospital, as your workers always go where they're needed.  Sometimes, you need to move handymen to different spots to clean up vomit and litter faster.  Remember to hire enough maintenance men to inspect the rides, otherwise CRASH!  Patrons can die in this game, so watch out!  You can also check what the customers are thinking about your park and the different rides.  The only annoying part of the game is when customer after customer gets lost and the game keeps beeping at you.  You have to adjust the walk ways to prevent this.  Otherwise, this game is loads of fun, easy to learn, and very rewarding when you begin to see the amusement park of your dreams taking shape!"
2960900,B000Q7ZLU6,This is SO Cynical,"The only reason Time-Warner continues to put out this one disc/three-four episodes nonsense is to snare small children, who will needle their parents into making the impulse buy. The adult fans of these shows already know to wait for the inevitable box sets. This is aimed squarely at kids, who don't have the ability to discern what a bad deal it truly is. Shame on you, Time-Warner."

1857119,B00005LVZJ,Instant classic; Kurupt does it again!,"Kurupt continues to come with amazing albums.  Space Boogie has Kurupt actually crossing-over, and he does a great job.  He combines his usual gangsta sound with amazing beats and a bit of commercial appeal.  But don't get this twisted: Kurupt sticks to what he's strong with.  He raps better with every album, and keeps coming off impressively.  He's the only person who could work with Everlast or Limp Bizkit and still make a great album!  Who else could do that?  Kurupt also works with his long-time friend and partner in DPG, Daz Dillinger.  Production done by Fred Wreck, DJ Quik, Daz himself, DJ Lethal, and Jon B., plus many others.  And Kurupt has Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, DJ Quik, Soopafly, Daz, MC Ren, Xzibit, Jon B., Everlast, and others guesting with him on Space Boogie.The album starts out with a spacy introduction.  But then follows into &quot;Space Boogie&quot;, a track with a bouncy little beat.  Kurupt rips this to shreds, some of the sound effects almost even sound like &quot;Dogg Pound Gangstas&quot; from Dogg Food.  Then Nate Dogg sings a great outro to make this a quality song.  &quot;Don't Hate On Me&quot;, sounds like a Death Row diss.  The track features Soopafly and Damani, and they rip into them with witty diss lines.  The beat is real bouncy, and Kurupt names the people Death Row seem to be hating on, like Tray D, Goldie Loc, Snoop, Soopafly and Nate.  &quot;On The Grind&quot; features Daz Dillinger, this song was also on Daz's R.A.W., but it is still a classic track.  It was one of my favorite songs on Daz's album.  A nice, laid-back gangsta track.  &quot;It's Over&quot; features Blaque, and is the first single.  It sounds a bit radio-friendly but it's a nice track, Kurupt raps quite nicely on here.  The beat is kind of happy-sounding.  &quot;Can't Go Wrong&quot; is my favorite song on the album, it's featuring DJ Quik and Butch Cassidy.  This song has a great beat, and Kurupt totally rips it.  An instant classic.  Quik also gets his rap on here and does so nicely.  The song is laced by trumpets and saxophones.  &quot;It's On, On Sight&quot; is a good bumpin' track with Kurupt coming off well.  The beat has guitars and a deep bassline.  &quot;Sunshine&quot; features Jon B., and is a nice summertime type of song.  Jon B. even sings a verse, but Kurupt raps two verses and holds his own on this song.  &quot;The Hardest&quot; is a posse cut with MC Ren, Xzibit and Nate Dogg.  The beat is rough and rugged.  Everyone gets a piece on this song, most definitely a hardcore track.  &quot;Gangstas&quot; features Daz over this beautiful, indescribable beat.  Kurupt and Daz give this song a more lazy, breezy feel.  &quot;Bring Back The Gangstas&quot; features Snoop Dogg and Goldie Loc over a beat that sounds like a mix of &quot;Stacy Adams&quot; and &quot;B-Please&quot;.  Snoop really rips on this song, Kurupt also comes off nice, Goldie Loc is all right, but his presence isn't really felt.  &quot;Lay On Back&quot; is a good track with Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and Nate Dogg.  The only problem with this song is Durst.  His verse is pretty bad.  Luckily Kurupt and Nate rip the track to shreds, and DJ Lethal came with a nice beat, to make this a good song.  &quot;We Just Don't Give A ....&quot; is produced by DJ Lethal and he brings a nice guitar-laced beat.  Kurupt literally assaults this song.  He raps with the most proficiency I've heard from him in a long time.  &quot;At It Again&quot; is a nice party track, with a sample from a song by GUY.  It sounds a little bit like the music on Live From L.A., it's got that great California soul sound to it.  Kurupt comes off well too.  &quot;Kuruption&quot; features Everlast on a guitar-laced song.  Fred Wreck and Soopafly help with production.  Everlast sounds all right singing.  Kurupt rips it up again.  This is a political type of track.  &quot;The World&quot; is a Dogg Pound track, a funky organ beat by Daz Dillinger and Kurupt coming off his usual classic style.  There are violins here too.  Great song.  The bonus song is &quot;The Life I Live&quot; (on my album) and is a slow song with Kurupt rapping solo.  It's very soulful and Kurupt talks about his life.This is definitely one of the best albums this year.  Right up there with the D.P.G. album: Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti.  You should try that one too.  If you're into Kurupt, you should get this.  He satisfies both genres: the G-Funk audience and the pop audience.  This is a great album."

1771038,B002MPQA50,These wire hose clamps generate a lot of clamping pressure.,"Why are these so much better than typical worm gear band clamps?  Simple physics.  First, the screw/nut tightening mechanism will generate a lot more force than the worm drive.  If you apply too much torque to a worm drive, you'll strip the slots out of the band.  Second, the surface area of the 2 wires is much less than the area of a band.  More force spread over a smaller area and the clamping pressure goes way up, making the hose connection much more secure."
3680009,B002RT8M84,Worth Every Penny,"My first impression was ""holy cow, that's expensive"", but when I looked at a variety of other dishes and pet stores, I decided to give this one a whirl.  I am thrilled.Numerous people have said they found the dish flimsy... I didn't think this at all.  When it arrived, I squeezed and pushed on the plastic and it didn't change shape or crack.  I was exceptionally thrilled with how easily the packaging sticker peeled off; no ugly sticky residue!It's a clearish white plastic with a sturdy base and a stainless steel insert.  It's all dish washer safe.  I really like that it twists into a locked state of sorts so that if my cat does manage to tip it over, the dish will stay together.  No water all over my floor!The design is modern and attractive.  Not that it's important in a water dish, but an added bonus of sorts.  It holds roughly a gallon of water, which is perfect to me.  The water goes in the bottom and then you flip the container onto the base.  Normally I'm not a fan of this design, but this one closes and then has a tiny valve the water comes out.  No spillage!  It also has the option for filtration attachment, but it's not necessary.  We use filtered water anyway, so I like that I didn't have to buy filters."
3743209,B0002UQATS,Two different products being reviewed here,"Meguiars came out with the original NXT around 2005 and it was actually a pretty good product.  Not the greatest shine but was fairly durable and easy to apply.  Then, sometime a few years later, NXT 2.0 was introduced and to me, it was a huge step backwards.  Although it just received a highly favorable rating from the big consumer magazine, it is far from one of the best products on the market.  This version 2.0 has very poor gloss characteristics on dark colored cars and the durability is just terrible, literally no more than six weeks before water stops sheeting off the car.I maintain eight different personal cars and so am almost always waxing something.  I think all the high priced, multi-step products are just so much snake oil being sold at outrageous prices and trust me, I've tried almost all of them.  Good surface prep is the key to the success of any wax/synthetic product and that involves clay, light cut cleaner, polish and then the final way.  Once prepped properly, just about any product will do really well and, if applied regularly, will protect the finish and make future preps unnecessary.  My current favorite for durability and shine is Turtle Wax cleaner/carnuba although the good old Meguiars cleaner was in the purple bottle is still a darn good product at a bargain price."
1464569,B003Q53VZC,quite the letdown,I preordered this game a couple of months ago.  I beleived it was going to be an exciting change of pace from the usual first person shooter and the trailer was incredible. I was wrong!  The single player mode had the most depressing opening of any game I have ever seen. At one point two Korean soldiers kill a couple as they beg for their life in front of their infant son.  Then they allow the son to approach the parents and touch his mothers face while he sobs uncontrollably.  I played the campaign for about 10 minutes before I became so frustrated with the gameplay that I just shut off my system. After a couple of hours I tried the multiplayer.  I think it was one of the worst online gaming I played in a long time.  In a nutshell..I truly hated this game and it was a real letdown.

2042288,0792846311,A True Classic! [UPDATED],"From the opening sequence to the climatic finale, Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" is a horror movie classic - not just from the 1980's or in the werewolf movie category, but of all-time. As 80's horror movies go, it's easily a top 10 entry, and as far as werewolf movies go, it's second only behind the original ""The Wolf Man"" in my opinion. Joe Dante's unique blend of expert storytelling, humor, and flat-out scares presents us with a very solid effort. It is much more engaging and scary than ""An American Werewolf in London"", which it is often compared to, and I would even venture to say that I liked the on screen werewolf transformation put together by Rob Bottin on ""The Howling"" better than the Rick Baker effort for ""An American Werewolf in London"". There just something gritty and real about ""The Howling"", which makes it all the more fun to watch.The acting is at times fair and at other times superb. Although I found Dee Wallace's portrayal as the tragic heroine of the film, Karen White, a bit melodramatic and at times weak, I found the main strength of this cast to be in the very strong supporting group - Robert Picardo (as Eddie Quist), John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Patrick Macnee, Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy, Dennis Dugan, and Elisabeth Brooks all turn in great performances, and Belinda Balaski steals the show as Karens ill-fated friend, co-worker, and confidant, whose investigative efforts, and ultimately, her attempts to save her friend Karen, lead to her own untimely demise.The production value of this movie is top shelf. From the great score by Pino Donaggio, and the beautiful cinematography by Jim Hora, the movie is a joy to watch. Simply put - ""The Howling"" is a definite must own for any horror fan. I have not seen the new Scream Factory Blu-Ray release yet, but I will update my review once I have.UPDATE - I recently purchased Shout! Factory's ""The Howling"" Collectors Edition Blu Ray. First off, the new slip cover art is FANTASTIC, as usual, and is what we have come to expect from these new Blu Ray/DVD releases from Shout! Factory. The film transfer looks great and the movie truly has never looked better. The sound mix is also nice and really enhances the creepy atmosphere of the film, especially in the finale. My only big gruff with the release is that the special features are not up to the standards that I've personally come to expect from Shout! 95% of what is found on this release was carted over from the previously released (and still a worthwhile purchase) ""The Howling"" 2 disc special edition DVD set. What should have been a bright spot for the Shout! release is that there is a ""Horrors Hallowed Grounds"" episode hosted by Sean Clark which is one of my favorite features of these new Shout! releases. Unfotunately, it is by far the shortest and least intresting of the group that I've seen. Overall, this is a great Blu Ray to purchase if you love this movie and want to see it look as good as it ever will, otherwise, the cheaper 2 disc special edition DVD set will suffice."

3745694,B000ARTZPO,Honda civic compatible,"Appears to be honda civic compatible. But after using Lubegard I have found a stark difference (better) with Lubegard. Lucas works but it slows down shifts (about a 2 seconds delay) and I had to gun the engine to get that power transfer up a hill or long shallow incline. Lubegard transfers power to the civic very quickly. I suspect that the reason is because lubegard is very thin and Lucas is too thick and tacky. Maybe it will work for you in a much more positive way, but not for me. I am surprised that other reviewers are saying that it makes shifting BETTER ???I will assume they never compared it to lubegard, so they would have known what smooth really is, like i did. OR perhaps it really shifts better based on the particular car make and degree of tranny damage; so in all fairness, I cannot knock those reviewers, but you can try lubegard. I stand by it; if you want smoother shifting (does not stop leaks if you have any !Conclusion: I deleted my initial review, in favor of lubegard. Lubegard is clearly a better product (but not all their other products are superior though). Lucas works so-so. I took off two stars after I found another product that works better. No, I do not work for them OR sell their products - I just love to tell people about great discoveries."

3759572,B006EGAIJ2,"Steep ramps, poor quality control, one mistake and they're gone","These are not my first ramps, they arrived in a huge box with a lot of packaging paper (so packaged well).  I put both on the floor next to each other in the living room, one of ramps had extra plastic material on the center part of it's bottom (who ever took the plastic out of the mold didn't do a good job cutting off the excess), so one ramp was swinging lift and right as my kids jumped on it, while the other ramp was perfect and not moving.  So I used a small handsaw to finish It myself.  A very simple thing for the factory to observe before shipping a none conforming part!FYI, I do have race ramps that I use for my lower sport sedan, and they have a 10 degree slope.Update 6-23-2013I was trying to go up the ramps slowly several times, I over did it and the right side ramp went under the tire and the ramp was bent (the walls from inside broke off with the center wall, twisted and some minor cracks appeared, so one mistake going up this 17 degree will cost you 55 bucks, burned faster than a match...I did drive again on top of these ramps, but not sure if they are safe for use.  I think a floor jack and couple of jack stands along with a very good knowledge of where to place and lift the vehicle is the best solution.used on a 2009 Chrysler Town and Country van. - curb weight 4750 lbs.Update 9-20-2013I forgot to mention, a day after the ramps were damaged, I called the manufacturer and they sent me new ones (which I'm selling as is) and sent back the damaged."

16972,B003N3J6BU,Half the Advertised Features Fall Short,"I've had this device for several weeks now, and I really wanted to like it. I wanted this device to shift from the gadget role into something handy and more mainstream, but it falls short. I'll talk about the good first. The ""leash"" role works pretty well. If you walk away from your phone, it goes off and it's a pretty loud sound too. It was fairly easy to setup on the computer and connecting to my phone which is an LG banter touch.Now onto some of the issues. The first is it sucks as a portable speaker/headset. People can hardly hear me, and I can't really hear them either. It's just awful in this area so this dual role is pretty much useless. It has a habit of setting off the alarm multiple times even after I basically told it to stop which brings us to the next part of the problem, it's one button design. It just doesn't work. Maybe after a year of solid use, using the push once in this situation and push twice in that situation will become second nature to me, but for me, this device is not meant to be used that often because, as I said above, the headset functionality is terrible. They should have just added another small button or two and just simplified the process. Another problem is the battery life. I don't know if it ever does anything besides stop ""beating"" when the battery is dead. You can glance down and check the lighted ""N"" to see if it is connected and working with the phone, but during a busy day or even week, I'll forget to look. When I do look, it's dead. I have no idea how long it's been dead, but the battery life seems pretty poor.I think this was an interesting idea, especially the leash part which works okay, but it falls short for the mainstream crowd and is really only something I think the gadget persona is going to love. I like gadgets; I do, but I am not so into gadgets that I collect a lot of them so this was just not for me."

3751944,B001AIZ5HY,A good DIY project that can save you some money,"I recently used the 3M headlight restoration kit to remove the yellow haze that had clouded the headlights on my 12-year-old Subaru Forester. A couple of years ago, I used one of those ""as seen on TV"" products, but the results weren't very impressive. For not much more money than I spent on that product, I bought the 3M restoration kit. I have to say that it did a nice job of cleaning the lens. It took about an hour's work to do the two headlights, including the time it took to mask the surrounding painted areas, and it took a good bit of care, but the results were very acceptable. I recommend the 3M restoration system to anyone who wants to have a go at restoring their headlights. The included simple instructions take you through the process. However, if you've never done this, or you're really uncertain about the process, consider checking your local automotive detail shops about having it done. It's not horribly expensive, typically $40-$75 per headlight in our area. But if you like do-it-yourself projects, restoring your vehicle's headlights is a very doable project with the 3M restoration kit."

1858807,B00005S7UE,A collection of hits,"This album is a two disc collection of all of Mariah's hits, including number 1 hits and beyond.Disc one offers songs from her self-titled debut to the Daydream album featuring a non-album song Endless Love, a duet with R&amp;B legend Luther Vandross.Disc two showcases songs from Daydream to Rainbow.  Includes a bonus track of All I Want For Christmas Is You except this is the So So Def Remix featuring Jermaine Dupri and Lil Bow Wow.  The second disc also features non-album songs (except on Number 1s) Sweetheart, When You Believe (duet with Whitney Houston from the Prince of Egypt soundtrack) and I Still Believe.Overall, this album is similar to Number Ones, if you are a Mariah fan, I suggest getting both but if you just like Mariah's singles, this collection has more songs than Number Ones therefore I recommend you get this one, however the cost is a bit higher.If you don't mind spending the money, I would definitely recommend this, it's a great collection to play if you don't have time or just don't feel like switching the CDs over and over just to hear songs from a variety of albums."

When the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects, this is a major concern. It may be that I got a bad box that got missed by quality control, but it does make me suspicious of Pyle products."
1567272,B000R4LONQ,And the list goes on....,"It's amazing how our ancestors could use natural products to get the job done for so many years, and yet we find it hard to let go of the ""new and improved"" mindset that not only costs us more but also pollutes our world.  Through the years I have learned of the many uses for borax, besides the commonly known laundry booster, and I will list a few of them here in hopes that someone might find them useful.1.  Frontloading washer deodorizer: I have a frontloading washer that I absolutely adore, but I find that sometimes it has a musty odor that transfers to newly cleaned clothing.  This especially happens during the summer.  I have tried leaving the door ajar when not in use, and I've also tried adding plenty of bleach to my white towels to ""shock"" it with no luck.  There is even an expensive product that is being sold to deodorize your washer.  I decided to try putting about  cup of Borax into the washer before loading the clothing, and that did the job.  No more odor.  I only have to do this occasionally to keep things fresh.  A cheap and easy fix, and it is also working as a laundry booster at the same time.2.  Flea killer: I lived in Miami for a couple of years and also in San Diego.  People in both cities told me that they had the honor (just kidding) of being the ""flea capital of the world.""  When I first moved to Miami, I overheard a woman in the grocery aisle explaining how she was finally able to cancel the twice-per-month exterminator visits to her home to kill all the fleas her little boy was allergic to.  Her exterminator finally told her to buy some 20 Mule Team Borax and mix it 50/50 with table salt, sprinkle it all over her carpets, lightly drag a broom over it to help work it into the carpet, and then don't vacuum for at least 3 days.  Even when you do vacuum, some will still remain in the carpet fibers.  She did this, and she hadn't had a single flea in over a year.  I immediately bought the Borax and salt and treated my home.  I never had a single flea in Miami or San Diego from that day forward, in spite of the fact that I had dogs who had ALWAYS been infested with fleas everywhere we lived.  Apparently any fleas that came in on the dogs would jump off and die.  I really don't know the purpose of the salt, and maybe you don't need it, but I wasn't going to take a chance.  I've lived in many states since then, and that was 28 years ago.  I haven't seen a flea in my home or on my pets in all those years.3.  Silly Putty: Okay, maybe this isn't something you really need, but it's fun to make this homemade version if you have kids or grandkids.  Mix 1 teaspoon of borax into 3/4 cup of lukewarm water till mostly dissolved.  Slowly mix this solution into a cup of white Elmer's glue. If you want it colored, mix a few drops of food coloring into the glue first. Work the Borax/glue mixture with your hands until it is no longer sticky and resembles the texture of Silly Putty.  It may take a few minutes, but it will get there.  Keep in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator.  If you prefer a Slime or Gak texture, then mix 1/2 cup of glue with 1/2 cup of water, color it, and then slowly mix the borax water solution into it.  It will be a thinner, stringy concoction.  Work it with your hands till it is well blended."
3758339,B004LSTQWU,"Good and bright, but it broke when I was installing it.","I only got to check it out a a couple seconds, when I touched it to the contacts in my truck's dome light, it was a bright clean light, definitely what I was looking for.  But when I was installing it, one of the contacts snapped off the circuit board.  The end contacts are only attached via solder connections, and it didn't take much for that to break.  Looks like I'll just get a regular incandescent bulb from an auto parts place.  Disappointed."

Would definitely spend the extra few bucks and get the Metal Hook with brushed nickel finish.It makes a world of difference, and has a much nicer feel, appearance and durability."

1845377,B000005GIU,joyous collection,"I can't add much to what's already been written about Emitt Rhodes. He was indeed a talented singer-songwriter who wore his Beatles/Brit Invasion influences on his sleeve, and never received the acclaim or popularity he deserved. Fans of the Beatles, or late 70s power-pop, are sure to find songs on here that will make them smile and sing along. So many well-crafted tunes on here, it's hard to pick highlights. It's very gratifying to see his studio albums packaged together and available again on this 2-CD set. A very worthwhile purchase for pop-rock fans."
123419,B009CRH0O6,Looks Cheap,"I really liked the color of this bluetooth.  I bought all three models, HM1900, HM1700 and the HM1300.  This model had the most vibrant color but I saw a similiar one for five or below.  The calls were not all that clear and callers complained of hearing feedback and not being able to hear me well on the call.  The ear piece that goes around the ear breaks easily on all of the models and the extra inserts hurt my ear making me have to purchase a new bluetooth because the extras all broke and the others provided hurt.  If you are looking for cuteness then get it but the sound is horrible."

Get over it. If you understand her past and her struggles, you'll understand that she deserves all the fame and fortune she's earned, thus far. Anyway, regarding this single, &#34;Roar&#34;, is another one of her hit songs and just listening to her singing turns me on... However, the 1 negative about the album, &#34;Prism&#34;, is that almost all the other songs on that album are not worth listening to. I realize this review is about her song &#34;Roar&#34;, but I had to inform anyone who's reading this that the album &#34;Prism&#34; isn't worth buying. Just download &#34;Roar&#34; and enjoy."

3739275,B00H8MDLUE,Does what it says...,"... and clumps nice and solid.What I REALLY love about this litter: it doesn't get sticky when it clumps, like some other clay litters. Thus, I don't end up chipping half-solidified clumps of gooey litter from the sides and bottom of the box. It makes for a much quicker litter scooping, and means that I can waste less litter--I don't have to dump the box weekly due to a buildup of stinky little bits that fell out of broken-up clumps.This litter also does seem to be fairly low in dust, for a clay litter. The first time I used it, I stood up straight, dumped, and stepped back to watch the dust cloud. I could see one, but it didn't POOF up out of the box like a lot of clay litter dusts do.Is it low-tracking? To be honest, I can't really say. This litter is teensy little sand grain-sized particles, and I have carpeted floors. If it's tracking, it's getting lost in the carpet. Kinda disturbing on the one hand, but kinda nice on the other... larger crystals just accumulate on top of the carpet and get stuck to the bottoms of my feet, thus ending up EVERYWHERE.Why this litter doesn't get five stars: it has a very strong odor. If you like perfumed cat litter, you might be okay with that. I very much dislike scented litters, however, and when I first got a whiff of this, it was almost enough for me to return it without even trying it. My cat has a history of deciding he dislikes scented odors, too, so we'll see how long I can get away with using this before he decides going next to the box is preferable to going in it...... but for now, I like the solid clumps, low dust, and apparent lack of tracking. My boys seem to like the texture, evidenced by my kitten's enthusiastic digging like a kid in a sand box. So far, so good!"

1313648,B00004RBOK,Yet another poor X-Men game,"Here is yet another poor X-Men game for the GBC courtesy of Activision, only this one is the worst.  While the PS1 version of X-Men: Mutant Academy wasn't half bad, this GBC conversion is downright terrible thanks to the clunky controls, insanely easy difficulty, bland backgrounds, and scratchy sound.  While the player animations are colorful, they are quite jerky, and while the selection of fighters is nice, there is just something more to be desired.  All in all, even if your the biggest X-Men fan, leave this game on the shelf, it's terrible."
1891248,076780192X,Overrated and mediocre dvd quality,"I vividly remember seeing ""CE3K"" as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote ""We are not alone!"". Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about. This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most overated films. It resembles a tv mini-series, long and plodding, and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions. I'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it! As with many early Spielberg films, there are lots of noisy, irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia. After a long hour and a half, these people finally make it to Devil's Tower, where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans. This sequence is still dazzling, but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show. And, oh yes, that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie!I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well. There is a highly noticable ""shimmering"" in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents. Also, the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks. Many scenes were ""soft"" and uneven. The bonus disc, however, is very nice and contains great interviews and a documentary about the making of the film."

1294337,B0002CZW0Y,Something Funky Going On,I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).
3599266,B0002DH396,Cool Lil holder..,It's works but the elastic strip on top slides down and covers the leash pullout and it needs a better stitch in spots but for 5 bucks it arrived on time and I don't carry the slobber ball with two fingers anymore.. Worth it to me...
1733761,B000KKUTCY,Sweet roll!,"This tool-roll works better than I had hoped. I put all my wrenches and sockets in there with a bunch of other tools that used to rattle around loosely in a bag in my jeep. They are nice and quiet, stay clean, and are easier to find now that they are organized in the roll. The quality is better than expected and has held up quite well. The straps are long enough that i could add a few hammers and they'd still be long enough to hold it closed, and if it were skinnier they would work for that too. I couldn't have asked for more in a tool-roll. The carry handle is also very nice. The stitching seems to be quite sufficient for the weight and would likely withstand more than I have in there. I will probably get another, and am considering it for a gift to a few other people whom I know would appreciate it. Way better than I expected, purchasing it sight-unseen."

1866129,B0000TAZS8,DISGRACE TO MUSIC!!!!,"I don't listen to much rap. When I do, it's mostly old stuff like N.W.A., Public Enemy, Ice Cube, humously issued Tupac (the albums he released when he was live), KRS-One, etc. It's a shame how rap has become so low. If you want good rap, listen to any of the above mentioned rappers/groups. Until rap finally becomes good again, listen to good quality music like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, etc."
1294418,B0002D01KO,Bare Minimum,"As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price."
3752694,B001GH5P3S,Not exactly factory.,"Installation was easy and only took 15 minutes to complete.  I didn't have a problem taking off the clips - just be sure to take your time and dont rush it.  The finished product doesn't exactly look factory, however no one other than a die-hard Jeep fan would notice anyway.My GPS unit is too small for the lips so I'm still going to use the window mount for it.  I'm also considering getting rubber matting for the insets to ensure things dont move while in motion.  Overall I'd recommend it as it does add more space to put things like a phone."
3744527,B00092893E,Really Works!,"Bought this for the first time to try out on a 95 camaro 3.4l V6 with 155k miles.

The car failed the smog test, so i used this in addition to SeaFoam through the throttle body.  Will see if it passes smog now, will make an update."
1874428,B000H0MKGK,One of 2006's best albums!,"Nelly Furtado may have been 2006's best new album but singer-songwriter John Mayer comes in 2nd with his album ""Continuum.""  I love the hit single ""Waiting On The World To Change"" which should have been a bigger hit.  At least he is having sucess with his hit single ""Say.""  While he may be known right now for dating actress Jennifer Aniston, we often forget that he is a musician first.  In this album Mayer gets right aside other artists and bands like Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews.  This is a fun, laid-back listen.  The single ""Gravity"" will have you singing along just like ""Waiting On The World To Change.""  Every song is worth listening.  John Mayer could be hailed as the best male singer right now (Sorry, Justin Timberlake!).  Overall I would definately reccomend his  most recent album ""Continuum.""  I can't wait for another album from him!"
1856231,B00005AKBN,Very disappointing ... if you know the original versions,"All these mixes and remixes are bad ... there's nothing like the original versions if you know them.

I was looking for a &#34;healthier&#34; alternative to pasta.  This just isn't it for me.

You can't be competitive, unless you pay after the first game. As a marketing person,  I thought the whole point was to have as many people using your product as possible,  instead of restricting them. Very puzzling.

1476906,B004HYK956,5 Star Reviews Are Right,"Don't think anyone is going to read this, but if you are then this is meant to be a brief review. I'm just rating for the sake of just that. After doing much research here on Amazon, then playing Skyrim for myself I have to say that All the 5 Star Reviews Are Right when saying this game has lived up to the hype and is the greatest RPG on xBox360. Skyrim stretched the consoles capabilities to the limits with it's vast open world, stupendous graphics, and arsenal of unending quest/things to do. This game is worth the $ for sure and a *five***Stars* in my book.There's a lot of complaints I noticed on Amazon about the gamebreaks, freezing, bugs, etc..... I only ran into one Freeze and I'm 70 hours in and completed the main story. This is my advice since this is something I practiced in Morrowind that may help prevent these little hickups. Biggest thing is don't litter too much when playing Skyrim. When you don't need an item sell it to a merchant, try not to throw it on the ground because the game then has to remember that the item was left there. This causes the game to work slightly harder and can cause more loading+potential freezing/glitches. Just something that has worked for me idk it may work for anyone else. Also I only use 4 save files when playing Skyrim. 1 is master save file where I physically have to click save (it's been rewritten 450 times, yeah I save a lot.) The other 3 are auto saves that the game does consistently. Again this is another technique I practice when playing a vast game as this because it makes less that has to be remembered.Here's a funny incident when I did litter in a town. One of the guards saw me do it then approached me saying ""Hey you can't leave that there go pick it up"". Might be Bethesda hinting on the topic : DAny who it's a great game and you can get it for cheap in the used section. Now to end this review with my own personal dragon shout to you concerning buying the game  ""GO FO IT!"""

Sure it's not classic like the first ones that came out, but I'm not all for the classic anyway~!This game is definitely better also because of the extra things that happen out of the routine from the other games (I haven't played Diamond or Pearl, so I don't mean them) and well, it's a great way to pass time.The only downside I really see to this is that...Giratina of all pokemon, especially being a cover pokemon, is waayyyy too weak at a lvl. 47 upon capture. It's just rather shocking how weak it is. But I guess that's beyond the point.Also, as other have already said, this IS a remake of Diamond and Pearl...that should be known already."

N***az - 3/5 - Not one of my favorite songs on the album. Don't like the instrumental too much.2. Now What - 4.5/5 - Dope punchlines and the instrumental is good too.3. Rims [Skit] - N/A4. Now Ride - 2.5/5 - I don't like this song too much.5. Think Y'All Know - 5/5 - This is one of my favs. on this album. I think this was also a single, or a split video, can't remember.6. Chicks [Skit]- N/A7. Make U Mine - 5/5 - Love this song, but not what it's about. Dope instrumental, Fab lays down some good lyrics and it also features Mike Shorey.8. Faboloso - 3/5 - Sampled instrumental, the original is ""Who's That"" by R. Kelly. It's only about a minute long, that's why I gave it a 3.9. Fire [Remix] - 4/5 - Dope song. Features Joe Budden and Paul Cain. It's a remix to the original ""Fire"" by Joe Budden. Love the chorus.10. I Usually Don't - 3.5/5 - Another song I don't like too much.11. Renegade - Another sampled instrumental, the original by Jay- Z (same exact song name) featuring Eminem. This song, I think it features Paul Cain and Joe Budden. Anyways, it's a dope song. If you like this one, check out the original version.12. F You Too - 2/5 - Another song I don't like too much.13. B.K. Style  - 5/5 - Samples Lil' Kim's ""This Is Who I Am"", B.K. Style is one of the best songs on this album. Fabolous spits crazy punchlines like ""The way I pass the rock can make Jason Kidd a fan of me"".14. Can't Let You Go [Remix] - 4/5 - Produced by Just Blaze, this song is supposed to be a club banger. First time I purchased this album, I thought that the remix of ""Can't Let You Go"" was going to be another love-like song about cheating. I don't like the idea that Just Blaze made this more of a club banger than it is a cheating song, but it's still a pretty ill song.I really don't like ""More Street Dreams, Pt. 2: The Mixtape"". I think that ""Street Dreams"" is a way better album. Better songs, better lyrics, better collaborations and better instrumentals. Anyways, this is still a pretty good album, but I think that Fab could have done a better job.Peace."
1299835,B0015RIN6U,Perfect...,My experience with this little tuner has been perfect...It's extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment / it's dead quiet when activated / easy to understand when you are looking down at it while you're tuning / Takes up very little room on a pedal board / the cream on the coffee is that it's under a hundred bucks - that's crazy for the build quality - it's a little iron BRICKI highly recommend this little guy - Korg got it right on this one..!!!
3759382,B005UWD2J4,Lcd digital voltmeter,The rear of the meter is exposed and very sensitive to the elments. The Panel fell apart as I tried to install it. I do not understand why they do not install it into a plastic box even to be used in a panel a box would make it easier and less fragile to handle.

1030999,B00AO2P3GA,good but lots of bugs,this is a very good game but the thing that gets me so mad is the bugs. there is one where after you play a multiplayer game you may have 10k $ but then when you exit you only have about 9k $ then when you buy some thing for 5k you only have 1k left. I think the game is great but because of these bugs it isn't as fun because its really hard to get cash.

762763,B0077SGMXM,IAP Crap In A Bag,"This game is little more than a way for a shady Dev to sell nothing for real money.... $40 in app purchase in a paid game..... You can buy brand new Xbox 360 titles that took teams of writers, artists, coders, marketing departments , proffessional voice actors, motion capture, etc etc for less than this....... How do devs justify this level of greed?..... Disgusting.... uninstalled and forgotten."
1838268,B000002LFZ,A Great First Start,"This was the first Fleetwood Mac album I bought, some years ago. As such, it was a wonderful introduction to the realm of the band, at least its Buckingham-Nicks lineup (without a doubt their most successful period, and arguably their greatest creatively). Contains the whole gamut of hits, &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; &quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; &quot;Little Lies,&quot; yada yada yada. And if you're new to FM, or only know their Rumours stuff (as was my case), this really is a good start. You get to hear Fleetwood Mac at their most radio-friendly, without some of the other aspects of each songwriters' talent that might take some time to adjust to (Stevie's six-minute cosmic rants, Lindsey's insanity). You miss out on a lot (I had no concept of TUSK from hearing this album), there are a couple curious omissions (where's &quot;The Chain?&quot;), and a band such as Fleetwood Mac really deserves to have its entire catologue heard (otherwise you'd miss gems like &quot;That's Alright&quot; and &quot;World Turning&quot;), but it is a good CD, and as one guy pointed out, a great party album. The two new songs are pleasent, nothing exceptional-- &quot;As Long As You Follow&quot; has a great melody and catchy guitar solo, but the production is a little watered-down in light of the sonic collages from TANGO. However, this is really a great intro to Fleetwood Mac-- and actually, I found this compilation better represented the B-N era of the band than THE CHAIN box set. Go buy it!!"
502066,B00B11DOHS,Did not work at all.,"I was  very disappointed. I took the whole bottle as directed and got no result at all.  Even when I cut back on calories I noticed no difference. I am 60 so my metabolism has slowed down.  I have a friend who tried it at the same time and she got no result either.  Bummer, and after Dr. You-know-who raved about it too."
1422345,B001MIQ46S,This is one of my favorite games,"I love this game and have played the first one since it originally came out.  It is a great real time strategy game where you don't have to micromanage everything, plus you have the unique challenge of not being able to command your heroes, but to reward them to get them to do what you want.  As they buff up, they tend to be a lot more bold.  The heroes act differently every time.  They may stay and fight a tough opponent, sometimes they run at smaller ones. I like the unpredictability.  The maps are random so that also adds to the re-playability.The only down part is that since I upgraded to Windows 7 I haven't been able to get it to run, even in compatibility mode!!  I am very sad.  I love playing this game on international flights to pass the time. I hope someone figures out a way to get it to run on Windows 7."
1863099,B00008J2DQ,Worthless,"I hate Godsmack with a fiery passion that consumes my soul. Does anyone else notice this is the exact same CD as Awake? Or that Awake was the exact same CD as Godsmack?

1858574,B00005R5V2,The voice you have been waiting for !,"This album is wonderful, I mean you thought you knew who Jill Scott was but you really don't 'till you hear her songs done liveUsually I don't buy live versions of albums I already have, but in this one she adds so much personality to the songs that I felt like I was sitting in the audience. I even started talking to my CD player saying, &quot;SING IT GIRL!&quot;. Jill puts her all into her voice and I'm so happy to hear her over and over again"
2902957,B000HWZ4CU,Stan and Ollie in the Clutches of Leo the Lion,"The best aspect of this Laurel and Hardy ""double feature"" is the excellent print quality. In fact, the Warner DVD transfers are far superior to Hallmark's pathetic L&H product. Unfortunately, ""Air Raid Wardens"" (1943) and ""Nothing But Trouble"" (1944) find Stan and Ollie submerged in the cold rigidness of MGM's studio system - the same fate that greeted Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and Our Gang. The boys deliver a few laughs in these later efforts, but the fun and spontaneity of the Hal Roach days are long gone."
433196,B004UOHPK0,Bitter,"This is a powder designed to be poured into water and stirred, with the idea being that it gives the water some flavor.  I thought this would be good for me, because I drink a lot of water, often in place of other soft drinks, but sometimes the lack of taste really gets me down.I appreciate the ease of using this product; the powder comes in small sealed tubes, and within each tube is the exact amount of powder appropriate for use in a standard-size glass of water.  Similar products I've used in the past required a certain amount of guesswork for how much to mix in with the water.Of course, similar products also tasted good.  This does not.  It's got a very bitter taste that's just barely recognizable as berry at all.  Now the whole point to adding this powder is to give water an interesting flavor.  The flavor this imparts is not at all something I'd want to taste, so whatever else one can say about this product, it's rendered completely moot by its failure to meet its one and only function.  Too bad; they'd really have something here if it tasted better."
1857166,B00005M987,Refreshing,"In a world where there are seemingly endless Britneys and Christinas emerging on the pop scene, it is overwhelmingly refreshing to come across a fully-clothed, talented young woman who plays guitar and sings with soul. This is exactly what you will find on Michelle Branch's debut album, ""The Spirit Room"". Full of brilliantly-crafted tracks, the record is one that will live on beyond the studio creations of other pop princesses.Sounding more mature than her years, Branch brings to mind what a young Sheryl Crow or Meredith Brooks sounded like. Every track here is edgy, with a rocky vibe and catchy refrain. Rather than go through each and every song, I'll give you the highlights:'Sweet Misery': Taking a cue from '80s ballads like 'Time After Time', 'Sweet Misery' is a both touching and memorable look at the bitersweet feelings love can evoke.'Goodbye to You': One of Michelle's more mellow tracks, 'Goodbye to You' paints an accurate picture at what a breakup is like - not angry but painful.'All You Wanted': A radio hit, this track is a bit more pop than the other songs on the album, but still contains the rocky flavor felt throughout.'You Set Me Free': Another radio hit, this song is both infectious and irresistible. Featuring an addictive guitar riff and brilliant vocals, it is truly a great recording.With all of the over-produced garbage on the airwaves today, artists like Michelle Branch prove that true music is still out there. And if you're looking for a great musical experience, go no further than this record."

1676214,B00BDFNRG0,What The Heck Did I Just Eat?! And WHY?!,"When eating &#34;Pop Crunch,&#34; it's hard not to imagine Orville Redenbacher creating this in Dr. Frankenstein's lab with beakers boiling, sparks flying, and something familiar yet vaguely monstrous lurching to life. Or, as Dracula would say, &#34;Bleh!&#34;This is seriously weird stuff: every kernel is round and identical to all of the other clones in the bag. To provide an extra &#34;crunch,&#34; the kernels appear to be coated in some kind of odd glaze which isn't actually sweet - though subtly hints at it. The cheese flavor is standard chemistry set stuff, vaguely cheesy and bright neon orange. And the popcorn itself, oddly, doesn't really have much of a popcorn flavor.You can sorta, kinda eat this stuff - but then there's the aftertaste that others have mentioned. It not only stays on the tongue, it ripens and worsens...haunting you like the memory of a moral failing.  Popcorn should make you want a soda - not a full bottle of mouthwash.In fairness, I was going to give this product a second star because my daughter actually liked it. But over the course of writing this review, the sour nasty aftertaste continued to ferment in my mouth. BLEH!"

Despite the treachery that should happen in those days it does not.  The two women fall in love.  This is there tale.  The war is almost ended finally but the hatred of Jews is really fanatical.  The german officer who was to be divorced by the german woman surprises the two in an intimate moment of sleep.  He has the jewish woman taken away.There is only one outcome for her in the hands of german authorities.  A heartbraking tale of love that can not be broken even when death separates the lovers.

1844243,B000003B6J,"""You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.""","While there will always be something to be said about hip-hop artists who incorporate rational, intelligent social commentary into their rhymes, there's also something undeniably captivating about a group motivated solely by violence, hate, and oppression.  Public Enemy may have been all about fighting the power and the Black Panthers and all that, but NWA was just out to shoot some cops and trivialize women, and you've gotta respect that.  They just rapped about what they knew.  Which do you think more accurately reflects the mindset of disillusioned urban youth in the 80s: gang members or Farrakhan-namedropping zealots?  NWA is simply a cold, sobering slice of reality.  They weren't about social change; they were about expressing the present moment exactly as is.  And to this day, there has never been a better or clearer document of urban street life in music.As for the raps themselves, Ice Cube, M.C. Ren, and Dr. Dre's occasional appearances are all incredible.  Each has a different vocal and lyrical style, keeping the record dynamic and interesting throughout.  Eazy-E, however, has obnoxious delivery and easily the dumbest lyrics on the album.  ""Shinin' the light in my face and for what? / Maybe it's because I kick so much butt.""  Huh?  Gangsters say ""butt?""  Unintentionally hilarious if you ask me.  Fortunately, Cube and Ren more than make up for E's fumbles.All in all, an essential hip-hop document, even if it's not the most poetic or intelligent disc on the rap market."
1770240,B002KHNCSS,Not bad! Comfortable grip could be a touch larger...,"I don't have much to complain about. I've been using a set of wood handled picks for the longest time, and I swear the short, square handles were made for children.These rounded, textured, hard rubber grips are worlds better than my old wood ones. In fact, they're so good, they encourage more aggressive tugging, scraping, pulling, and picking. But nothing yet that's caused me to dull, snap, or bend a point.They come packaged in what possibly be used for a storage case, were it not such an annoyance to open (it's very much reusable). I'm quite sure they'll end up finding a home rolling around in a tool drawer, instead."
1376888,B000GE7O9K,"inventory control, plus weapons","i'm a mature gameplayer who recently bought a dozen videogames and an xbox 360 just to see how the technology has evolved. compared to other games i've tried i found this game to be boring and in parts annoying, and after a few returns have not been able to finish it. for me the core problem is the insane level of depth and arcana you are required to manage -- a cluttered map; a panoply of characters, tribes and evil thingies; a menu for all your clothes and armor, another for your spells, another for your weapons, another for your trinket odds and ends; a self designed avatar; several maps; powers and attributes that come and go -- it's like managing a special needs preschooler. (and this is a *game*?) and then there's the open ended scripting of a plot that is so complicated you need to take notes to keep track of it all. the visual design is ok but i found it insufferable to interact with the character ""talking heads"", whose mouths are really annoying to look at as they patter the lamest interactive dialog of any game i have tried. and the action elements are uncompelling and don't require much skill to accomplish. the only grace is the landscape rendering, which is fun just to roam through and leads to all kinds of random, sometimes bizarre encounters."

1682374,B00DS842HS,Nice alternative skin treatment,"We are using virgin coconut oil as an alternative to lotion specially during the dry winter season. We have already tried a couple more different brands and this is as good if not better than the others. It does prevent chappy and dry skin throughout the day. I just use a little dab, just enough to cover the skin. It will be absorbed after a few minutes and would not notice it is there including the coconut oil smell.Cons:the only con I can think of is more of a subjective matter. Coconut oil is fragrant, it is just not the kind of smell that you would expect from a regular lotion.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes."
1650321,B005G2FCSC,Better than gummy candy,"I was suffering from a sweet tooth, but did not want to purchase the famous gummy brands we all know.

1309834,B00002STH0,Diddy Kong Racing,"Diddy Kong Racing is the other major kart racer for the Nintendo 64. When it came out, most people were accusing Rare of copying the Mario Kart 64 formula. That may be true, but at least they made modification. For example, there is a major decrease in emphasis on items in Diddy Kong Racing. In Mario Kart 64, you need a good hold on the items to win. In Diddy Kong Racing, items are merely an afterthought. What are really important are the boosters strewn all around the levels. This creates a different racing feel that some people may like more than others. I personally feel that the karts are not as agile as they are in Mario Kart 64, and that decreases my enjoyment of the game. Ah well. The inclusion of two extra vehicle types adds a different feel to the gameplay. I didn't really like the plane, but hovercrafts rule! In a racing game, level design is just as important as the controls. The courses are nice, but a bit lacking in variety. Oh well. It was obviously a way to fit in with the five different sections in the single player mode. Gawd...the single player mode...the Silver Coin Challenges are no fair, I tell you!As the game is less focused on the items, the battle modes are a bit drawn-out and boring. However, Fire Mountain and Smokey Castle are brilliant. In Fire Mountain, your goal is to take eggs to your nest and make sure they hatch. The game becomes frantic with the addition of the ability to steal your opponents' eggs. In Smokey Castle, you must take 10 bananas (2 at a time) to your respectable treasure chest. It's not as awesome as Fire Mountain, but it's fun just the same. Graphics are actually decent for 1997. It may not be as visually stunning as what Rare would achieve in half a year with Banjo-Kazooie, but the game looks nice nonetheless. Most early Rare games have lousy backgrounds, but DKR's backgrounds are impressive. The music is terribly catchy, and the voice samples are cute. The Silver Coin Challenge is still unfair."

154803,B00BW4OM7K,Best S4 Screen Protector!,"In the past I used Zagg products, in fact when I bought my S4, I put a Zagg on it - thankfully they have a 45 day, no questions asked money back, because I hated it. I did my research and saw that this brand had become quite popular. I found inside my case, also a SPIGEN, a free screen protector, ripped off the Zagg, put on the free SPIGEN and loved it. No ""orange peel"" effect, crystal clear, didn't have issues with the touchscreen. The only problem was, the free one was a fingerprint magnet! I ordered Ultra Oleophobic and changed it and it is not a fingerprint magnet, so now I have the best of both worlds! I will continue to buy from SPIGEN, as long as they continue to make top quality products at great prices - more than half the price of a Zagg!As for protection, well, I was using the GPS on my phone and I had ""stuck"" to a sticky pad for GPS units, etc. on my dash board, but hit a particularly steep hill and off it tumbled, hitting the dash, console, gear shift and who knows what else. I thought for sure I just smash my brand new phone. I picked it up and not a scratch, dent, or crack anywhere! Thank you SPIGEN! If you are having trouble putting it on, the first review that shows up on here has great tips which worked perfectly for me (the second time - I messed it up the first time), but would add that instead of simply ""dropping"" the cover on top, to peel a little bit back, use your hand or cloth to smooth it down, peel a little bit more off and do this until the whole cover is on to keep down the bubbles. I didn't do this with the first cover and the bubbles wouldn't come out. At least 2 only cost me $13, so wasting one wasn't a big deal My previous cover as $30 for one! I also like the dry method, as opposed to my previous cover, which was a wet method."

1846513,B000006AXS,Surely one of the Art-Rock Scenes unsung heroes....???,"For a person that originally started out in the early days of the English Art Rock scene, Robert Wyatt has come a long way.  Still remaining something of a cult figure, for his uniquely English style of Canterbury scene music, that Incorporated elements of Post-Psychedelic, mixed with Improvisational rock-rhythms and highly articulate songwriting, coupled with a quaint retro-whimsy, that not only referenced a subsequent form of 'Instrumental Jazz', but also linked art-rock and psychedilia skillfully together.  He has remained on the musical fringes commercially, but remained critically acclaimed, even if that acclaim hasn't translated into mainstream sales, happily churning out albums that immensely pleased critics, and his fanbase.  But It wasn't really until 2003's exceptional ""Cuckooland"" (and a subsequent 'Mercury Music' prize nomination), that people are starting to catch wind of this guys remarkable talents.""Sea Song"" is the most gorgeous of songs, initially a sad sounding song, it has the willfully detached & melancholic tones, of singer-songwriter derived music, but the droning synths and delicate keyboard & harmonised vocals feel more like left-field ballads, are thoroughly steeped in a decidedly sombre tone, with Robert plaintive lyrics: ""You look different, every time. you come.... From the foam-crested brine, Your skin shining softly in the moonlight,  Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale..... Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?"", coupled with the quirky nautical theme.  A song that is as, slight and lyrically searching, as it is wonderfully sad, funny, and very, very strange.  It redefines what the accepted notion of what 'Pop' music should be.Second track ""A Last Straw"", is more subdued, Nocturnal, intimate & reflective.  The downtemp bass & ringing Hi-Hat open the beginning of this track, before Wyatt's high-pitched voices bursts forth with: ""Seaweed tangled in our home from home, Reminds me of your rocky bottom, Please don't wait for the paperweight....Err on the good side"".  The sound is one of an Jazz-improvisational feel coupled with jazz-tinged piano chords, mixed with the warm sounds, and atmospheric drums, that are more in line with the cerebral and hypnotic relaxed mood of electronica.  Curiously...Wyatt, begins to use his voice as a atmospheric instrument, adding 'Wah-Wah' sounds over the lush arrangements, that although proves to be slightly disconcerting at first, although after a few listens it begins to feel as integral as the music being played, before the track then begins to drift out, with a simple, lightly subtle ethereal background of piano composition.""Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road"", features huge trumpet and Saxophone arrangements, with a decidedly 'Afro-centric' percussive drum beat layered underneath the warm soothing synths.  Think a more improvisational unstructured Jazz, with a nice helping of swirling psychedelia, mixed with a weird turntable 'spin-back' effect, that seems to be simultaneously distorting the sound &  Wyatt's voice, over which he textures the sound with vocal 'Hums' & 'Ahhs', before choosing to sing some 3 minutes into the track, one of the strongest tracks, held together by the strangest of ideas.  Track 4 ""Alifib"" leans towards, the eerie detached, reflective electro-synth, that feels like the evocative, mournful, sample-laden downtempo sounds of electronic outfit ""Boards of Canada"", that starts this track, with delicately plucked guitar shuffling quietly in the background.  Wyatt lets the track slowly build momentum, and along with the melancholy synth, is arguably inventive and builds on the abundance of ideas throughout the album, and although the unusual sounds, may disorientated new listeners, they demand several listens to fully appriceate.""Alife"" uses a crackily sound distortion, with a odd off-kilter tabla-esque percussion and gloomy piano, a decidedly downcast saxophone, that punctuate the sound with wild Sax flourishes broaden the sound.  Wyatt sounds like he's having a theatrical conversation with someone (or indeed himself??), whilst the instrumentation gathers pace, with drums gaining in tempo, whilst the Sax shrieks, with the unrestrained fury of the 'Free-Jazz' that someone like the legendary 'John Coltrane' so vigorously championed.  It will at this point become a little clearer to most, that with each song, Wyatt is pushing the level of experimentation on each successive song, moving from more accepted Pop-conventions, into a more left-field Progressive Art-rock sound and becoming more increasingly psychedelic, that have some listeners (like myself) applauding his genre experimentation and attempts to offer a varied suite of songs that although broadly based in conventional genres (Pop / Rock ), are fused and intergrated with other genres to thrilling effect: (Jazz / Art-Rock / Progressive / Psychedelia).""Little Red Robin Hood Hit the Road"", is possibly closer in overall sound and composition to ""Sea Song"", with more jaunty feel....but a driving and militaristic Drum beat pounds over the top, with a stunning electric style Guitar, that immediately evokes comparisons to 'Pink Floyd' , with a uniform tone, ranging from the pastoral, but swiftly making the excursion into more lilting 'Space-rock' rhythms, mixed with gentle Violin, that isn't usually applied in these sorts of tracks, yet remains frequently intriguing, feeling like an appealingly mannered, very English form of psychedelia, before the track takes a complete U-turn and morphs in a distinctly theatrical dance production based on the idea of a cosmic and rustic theme.  The transition into theatrical music, will surprise many, and I myself had to check to see, if it was indeed a hidden track that had started playing, as it seems a slightly strange choice to finish the album on, but theres no denying that The melancholy strings and plaintive piano are beautiful, and feels like an underrated orchestral epic.Giving this album 5 Stars, hasn't been a difficult decision, as Wyatt has a sound that is uniquely his, and his ideas and styles are so varied that, it's an album that has enough ideas to double the 6 tracks that make up this album.  It's a album that'll certainly blur (or indeed Change) your preceptions of what can be accomplished within Popular music, and even though his music isn't something associated with retail performance, he is most definitely deserving of the critical praise heaped upon him.  But the harder decision to make is who to recommend this album to???  Newcomers would (as it pains me to say it) , be probably better served with a 'Best of' (try his : 'Greatest Misses' album for starters), as it's a easier introduction to his music, as the decidedly quaint and English eccentricities that are littered throughout this album, may cause first timers to wonder, 'What all the fuss was about?', but those that are familiar with his work: fans or otherwise (I downloaded a couple of tracks....loved it, and then bought the album), are advised to add this exceptional gem to their collections immediately."

When I freeze berries in them, it is almost impossible to get the bags clean once I thaw the bag. To my dismay, the replacement bags are no longer available. I tried those made by Zip Lock because they are supposed to work just as well. They don't. Almost impossible to get a tight seal and then it leaks air so food does not stay air-tight. Now that I am unable to purchase additional bags, I'll have to purchase the Reynold's electric one. I bought one of those for my daughter and son-in-law as a gift and they say it is wonderful. I'll keep my old battery powered one along with the few bags I have until I cannot use them anymore. Now I wish I hadn't used so many of my bags to seal gifts I was mailing. I don't regret those that went to Iraq as they kept even sand out of items for my grandson but those that were mailed to U.S. destinations could have been in regular bags with the air squeezed out.

1859669,B0000646TK,A Thousand Miles... minus five hundred,"Ah, Carlton, do sit down.  It's about this album of yours which you titled Be Not Nobody.  To be quite frank, you've hit the ground falling.Now there are a few bright spots on there, that wonderful ballad &quot;A Thousand Miles,&quot; which if memory serves, initially made its way on the Legally Blonde soundtrack,... yes, there it is, and your cover of &quot;Paint It Black.&quot;  &quot;Ordinary Day,&quot; well, I'll concede that to you.  But as for the rest of the album, well, it does leave a lot to be desired.It's one thing to use piano and strings as backing instrumentation--it's worked well for Tori Amos and Sarah Brightman, but these ladies have wonderful voices to support those instruments.  So, marks off for overutilization of instrumentation.Which leads us to vocal style.  You do have a styling that's somewhere between Jewel, Ms. Kilcher to you, Tiffany, and Nelly Furtado, but without enough range.  At times, it's as if someone's twisting a knife in your belly.  One of the problems is the listener being able to bear fifty-odd minutes of that without gnawing off one of his/her legs to survive.  I'm made of stronger stuff, but I can't speak for everyone else.  I can see you made a good effort on &quot;Pretty,&quot; but not on &quot;Unsung,&quot; which would have been first-rate.  So, let's mark vocal improvement here.Marks off for an excessive amount of filler, apart from the songs I mentioned and &quot;Unsung.&quot;Now, I've had a talk with the headmaster and he's willing to put you on probation, but he and I advise you to come up with something a bit more palatable next term or else your career will last a thousand hours and you will be not somebody.

1609227,B002MRNULA,"Not very good, poorly thought out","I had another GoPicnic box, and it was ok - this one on the other hand fails on too many levels.The positives:- The hummus, crackers and Almond Roca toffee all taste pretty good.What I didn't like:- Dried fruit was way too sweet. (dried fruits - specially pineapple - are already very sweet naturally, but this particular pack has additional processed sugar added, I couldn't get myself to eat it due to how sweet it was.- This is a ""picnic box"" where you can give it to your kids to eat out in the park, etc. However, you cannot open the hummus unless you got scissors, a very big oversight. There is nothing in the box that would help you open it. It's a really hard cardboard pack, no kid could open it by themselves, neither would most adults without the aid of a sharp knife/scissors.- The edamame (though relatively healthy) were just very dry, after a handful of beans my mouth was incredibly dry, and had a hard time finishing these - yes, even after drinking water.I cannot recommend this particular GoPicnic box to anyone. They have better options available."
1816308,B00CH97SES,"Nice, practical LED work light fixture","This task/work light uses LED lights in a compact fixture that can be attached to a cabinet or other locations. It plugs in with a standard A/C cord and is designed to be linked up with more fixtures (comes with a cord to link it to another one). The light is fairly bright and LED means energy savings and long life. The item I received was missing the screws that are supposed to be used for the hooks that hold the cord, though I didn't really need to anchor the cord in my setup. Overall this is a nice, functional item, and easy to install. LED is still fairly expensive, though with time I expect that the cost of fixtures like these will come down. One thing to be aware of is that the instructions say you should avoid installing this over a sink or stove, so perhaps heat and moisture would cause it to corrode."

Eventually after concentrating on steady breathing, and other anti-anxiety exercises, my heart rate came down, and I started to relax despite the unusual numb feeling in my head.Obviously I won't be buying this, or any other drink with L-Theanine.While I'm sure most people won't have the kind of adverse reaction that I had, I think it is important to understand that such a reaction is possible before you invest in buying a case of this stuff.As for flavor, I found the taste to be a bit, well, fermented.

760466,B00768WTXA,Just Not For Me,I love hidden objects games but this one is just not for me.  The artwork is gorgeous but it gets tiresome looking for ALL birds or butterflies.  I thought some of the levels would mix the butterflies and birds at least but not so.  After the initial 8 or 10 objects it was mostly blindly tapping to find the others.  The level I liked the best was the one with hearts and roses.  Really beautiful.  With all that said...I am sorry about opting to buy this game for I have one on my kindle fire that was free and like it so much better.  Actually what tempted me to buy this game was the reviews that extolled the quality of the artwork and I don't disagree about that....but the game itself gets tiresome.

Despite some negative reviews, I've fortunately never had a problem, nor been disappointed in the taste or quality. I'm not one to buy into the hype surrounding certain products, but I must admit that all of the positive things I've heard about coconut water have held true for me. Maybe the most noticeable thing is how much more &#34;hydrated&#34; I feel after drinking it. I work 12 hour shifts as an RN and this really helps as I often am too busy to drink as much as I should.

1389512,B000QB058U,Diablo in Purgatory,"In a word; BORING. Too much effort spent on lighting effects such as weapon flash or demon attacks and too little time on the environment. The levels are so similar that they quickly become tedious, so much grey, grey, grey everywhere. The way the NPCs jump and jerk around (bugs in  their pants?) when you're interacting with them is irritating. Also because of a game flaw they can be in two places at the same time and remain after their dead with one NPC superimposed on another. All this time spent to develope the game with so little to show for it. Certainly not the worst game ever but don't pay more than $15. The story line? Hmm, not sure of what to say there, confusing? All the weak parts of Diablo with little of the good.Diablo 2"

1794398,B0051V5DAK,The Mini is great only!,"I really like the mini version in this set, but the big/normal size knife is seriously flawed.  I will start by saying I am keeping this only because the mini knife is a very nice knife and operates perfectly with the blade secure.The problem is with the big/normal size knife, I have many cheap utility knifes and decided to buy the Bessey version just like this one but with brown wood which is nice with it's own flaws, but at least the blade is secure in the Bessey.  Not realizing the issue I was about to experience, I opened the Craftsman knife and started to cut my next package open with it and the blade slid out!  I was shocked by this since it almost rolled off and into my hand as I was applying pressure toward the box.I opened the blade latch and placed it back in and noticed the tiny notch that attempts to secure the blade, it is WAY too small.  I latched the blade back in and was able to pull the blade out of the knife with my fingers and then put it back in place without opening the blade latch.  This is a dangerous knife!  I will stick with the Bessey.I am saving this secure in the case it came with and put it in a safe place from anyone using.  I might have to video demo this!  I really hope the one I received is a onetime issue with this knife and nobody has the same issue and seriously hurts themselves with the big/normal size knife...  The mini-knife is a great knife though and to me is worth the price I paid for both.I have to mark this as 1 star for the dangerous flaw in the big/normal knife, but the mini-knife is a 5-star knife."

3353801,B005LAIH2C,Hansel and Gretel  Lifepath,"The film ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" centers around the close knit duo of Hansel (played effortlessly by Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (played in an incredible way by Gemma Arterton).  Both Hansel and Gretel are pretty much forced into a life of being witch hunters after they dare to eat from a secluded candy house in the forest.  I enjoyed the fact that Hansel and Gretel were created as characters of a brother and sister who stand by each other through good and challenging times. Hansel and Gretel's character evolutions are indirectly shaped (in different ways) by a discreet white witch named Mina (played in a heartfelt way by Pihla Viitala) and a troll named Edward (played naturally by Derek Mears).  In all fairness, Famke Janssen also played her witch character in a convincing fashion and in a way that also helped strengthen the tight bond that Hansel and Gretel have.  ""Hansel and Gretel"" is fine for those who are ok with watching films that mash fantasy and dark comedy in the plots."

1772509,B002Q8HGV0,"OK for household use, but nothing special","This appears to be a ""household"" tape measure. That is, this is a tape measure that you'd use for jobs about the house: minor repair tasks, hanging pictures, etc. It will also work for bigger jobs, but is definitely not the type of tape measure you'd use at a construction site or for a big remodeling task. I also do not think it will stand up to frequent use, and probably won't take a lot of abuse (drops, knocks, etc.).Keep this in mind, and it appears to be suitable. However, it's nothing special and you can find a better tape measure at a local hardware or home improvement store for the same price (or better). The only thing that really distinguishes it is its coloring scheme.The construction of the tape measure is reasonably solid. It is all plastic and rubberized plastic. It should be more than tough enough for use around the house. However, some of the plastic (the purple part near the locking switch) was literally a little rough around the edges and showed a lack of finish.On the side of the tape measure is a ""microbrake"". This is simply a button you push and hold to keep the tape in place without having to use the locking switch. When you release the brake, the tape retracts. Unfortunately, it's not easy to use if you hold the tape measure in your right hand and the tape itself in your left. You have to use your index finger to push the button, and it requires a lot of pressure, making it uncomfortable. If you hold the tape measure in your left hand, you can use your thumb, but the markings on the tape will be upside-down. Personally, I feel the microbrake is fairly useless. It's not a big deal to just use the locking switch.Based on its higher price and lack of features, I feel this is nothing spectacular. If it were priced lower it would rate higher."

1859964,B00006690F,THE REAL DEAL:,"With all the press and scrutiny that Marshall ""Eminem"" Mathersgets,you can't help but be  bombarded with his overly publicized,scrutized very public profile.After becoming a househould name and the (mostly white)press' poster boy for ""bad behavior"" with his multi-platinum 2000 opus ""The Marshall Mathers LP"",Eminem comes back to stir up more ""controversy"" with his followup,""The Eminem Show"".Now I know that surburban kids and even many real hip hop heads are going to applaud this album but the real deal with ""The Eminem Show"" is that it's no real ""Show""-stopper...This album is rather dull,predictable,and redundant.Never have I seen a hardcore hip hop album so blantantly targeted to white,surburban youth.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what Eminem's formula is:spit raunchy,""shocking"" rhymes over slow,menacing beats that give kids in the ""boondocks"" a taste of the thug life and mischievous excitement that they so crave and then whine about how bad your life is.That's the basic formula and ""The Eminem Show"" milks it for all it's worth.Eminem tries to play with the issues of race and the governmenton this 77 minute opus' opener ""White America"",spitting rhymes that claim that his white skin color was the real reason for his MTV success and that the government just wants to blame him for society's problems.Good premise but Eminem sounds so dim and harried that his point never leaves the ground and ""America"" comes off flat and as yet another attempt to shock.Obligatory ""I hate my life""-styled tracks like ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and the perky,Dr. Dre-produced ""Business"" will get the ""TRL"" crowd cheering but won't do anything for real music heads,if you ask me.Now I'll give Eminem props by saying that ""Show"" is very well-produced but what's the point when the rhymes are so redundantand so forced.The misogynistic sex rap ""Superman"" sounds very odd coming from a man who once rhymed that he wanted to slaughter his wife now boasting about his prowess with the females.And the unattractive sex rap ""Drips"" is just simply another boring turn-off.Trudging cuts like ""Till I Collaspe"" and the Dre-produced Jermaine Durpri diss ""Say What You Say"" also make you want to get a pillow and call it a night because this has been done so many times before by him.(I won't even mention the unabashed MTV-aimed first single""Without Me"":Is it me or does it sound like he's rapping over bad club music?)So yes,that's the deal,Mr. Mathers is out to swear his way to the bank(which he's already done,considering that this album sold a million copies in it's first full week of release) and unnerve the establishment but instead in reality,""The Eminem Show"" is basically a stale,repetitive,un-shocking bore."

1871500,B000A2H1D2,"Over Two Dozen ""Berries"" - Ripe for the Pickin'!","If you love Rock and Roll, you're going to love this CD. It's really that simple. Chuck Berry isn't the only early rock guitarist worth listening to (Eddie Cochran, Duane Eddy, and Gene Vincent's guitar players immediately jump to mind)but it's hard to think of another songwriter and performer from the era who contributed so many of the building blocks of the style. Before this CD was introduced, the best Chuck Berry collection was the legendary ""Great Twenty Eight"" but ""Definitive Collection"" is slightly longer, has better liner notes, and contains practically all the best-known Chuck Berry songs.Listen closely and you will hear where Angus Young, Ace Frehley, Jimmy Page, and Keith Richards got the foundations of their guitar licks from. Listen to the lyrics and you'll be treated to some clever vignettes, surreal 1950s imagery, and playful rhyming with an exceptionally lighthearted touch. To me, it's no wonder why so many songwriters and musicians from rockabilly, the British Invasion, and punk rock love this stuff. Chuck Berry practically invites you to play and sing along with him.I strongly recommend buying this CD (or the Great 28) rather than going on the cheap and picking up one of the questionable, shorter compilations. There's always the chance you will get burned with mid-1960s recordings of these hits or sketchy live versions with bad sound. Stick with the original recordings.The only better-known Berry track that isn't included here sadly enough is ""Run Rudolph Run,"" and I suspect that's because Chuck Berry didn't actually write that song. You can find it on various Christmas-themed compilation CDs, however."

Anyway, regardless of the comparisons, Travis has a great album here in ""The Man Who"". You may be tempted to get ""Singles"" instead, which is also great, but this is their best album. Like many, I picked this up for the hit ""Why Does It Always Rain On Me?"", then found the rest was just as good. The opener ""Writing To Reach You"" is excellent as well, and I believe both ""Driftwood"" and ""Turn"" were singles also. All four of those songs make this worth the purchase, but I really enjoy ""The Fear"" and ""She's So Strange"" too. There's also a hidden track, which I think should stay hidden. This album is very consistent in mood, and the musicianship and singing are both tops. My only regret is not getting this sooner."

What I can't tell you is how well they actually meet humidity ideals because I've never monitored the humidity in the case to see what it is and if it is on par with what the manufacturer says. I have taken it pretty much on faith that they deliver what they say and they have read some endorsements by people like Bob Taylor of Taylor guitars that they work. Bob has too good a name and no incentive that I know of to be frivolous about endorsing such a product that might not work, so, I take it that Taylor had his lab people check them out thoroughly to be sure of Humidipaks effectiveness before Mr. Taylor would give them an endorsement. That was good enough to sell me. But I didn't just buy it because Bob Taylor says they work--they occupy a very cool niche which I was hping someone would fill. Planet Waves Humidipaks are for the person who is willing to spend a little extra to not to have to keep fiddling around with water, sponges, gauges and those Oasis water bag and just have something that you can dispose of and replace every so often. That's what I want. Sure, water is free. But it evaporates fast and it's a job to keep having to take care of. So, is it worth it to buy a disposable thing like this that you don't have to mess with? Or do you want to save $15 or so by doing all that work wetting sponges and whatnot weekly? I'll gladly pay the extra few bucks not to have to worry about hydrating my guitars and cases but once avery 6 months.None of my guitars have shown any signs of humidity issues and I have lived in New York City and Virginia Beach in the years since I've been using the Planet Waves Humidipaks. One accolade that I will give Planet Waves is that they did recall the product a few years back and promised replacements when the new model which resolved a potential leakage problem was released. That re-release seemed to drag on for a while and when I contacted Planet Waves to gripe, they sent me a check for the ""list"" price of all the units I had returned to them. Well the list price was three times the retail price at the time and that was a bit of a minor windfall at the time for me which impressed the heck out of me and I used the money to buy their other humidity products in the interim to humidify my guitars. But when the Humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements ANYWAY. That was really being treated well by Planet Waves and I have never used anything else but Humidipaks since. Humidipaks give me peace of mind that my guitars are being humidified and I'm more than satisfied with how long the paks last."
1878580,B001HUBFPG,Enough is enough,"First the good news.  ""Careless Whisper"" isn't bad.  ""Right Here Waiting for You"" isn't awful.  They are listenable, and won't make your ears bleed.Unfortunately, the rest of the album features BM again, taking iconic, flawless songs that should never be re-recorded by anyone.  Just as his 70's project proved, sometimes perfection should be left alone.  You just don't remake ""I've Had the Time of My Life,"" ""Open Arms,"" and the rest.  They're still played constantly on popular radio stations, and the original performances can't be topped.  BM sounds like he's doing (bad) karaoke on most of these songs.So, BM, please stop the madness.  If you're tapped out on original songs, and Clive Davis insists on inflicting this punishment on your fans,  go back a few decades and find some unappreciated, underplayed songs that could use some new life.  Stop forcing yourself to re-record songs of recent vintage that you cannot possibly improve upon.And for God's sakes, don't even think about the 90's...unless you're prepared to do ""The Macarena,"" ""Tubthumping""  ""I'm Too Sexy"" ""Gettin' Jiggy With It"" ""Gangstas Paradise"" ""MmmmBop"" and ""No Diggity.""  (Hope I didn't give Clive and Barry any ideas)"
1828520,B0000024ZL,Streisand In Concert - An Experience To Treasure,"Hard to believe this concert was actually part of a fundraiser for 1972 Democratic Presidential-nominee George McGovern (who would go on to lose to Nixon).  You would never know listening to this incredible CD.  Barbra is in GORGEOUS voice, hitting all her signature notes with ease and finesse.  There's something about this performance that definitely transcends her earlier concerts in the 1960's.  The voice now is a bit more mature and knowing, still singing with plenty of power to spare, but now with a sense of ""woman"" in her interpretations.""People"" ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" ""Starting Here, Starting Now"" now all have a lived-in sense of feeling that her earlier 1960's performances somehow lacked.  Her interplay with the audience is PRECIOUS !  Streisand's audience command is definitely underrated with all her talk of stage fright.  You wouldn't know it listening to her interaction with the crowd.  She's very funny !The CD becomes invaluable with her rare performances of ""Where You Lead"" ""Stoney End"" (one of her biggest ""Rock"" hits) and the Burt Bacharach composition ""Sing"" (popularized by the Carpenters), songs she would never sing in public again for some reason.  This performance was taped just at the start of Barbra's transition from singing Broadway songs to her attempt to be more ""Rock"" oriented, so it's a nice combination of songs from both eras in her storied career.  A Definitely ""Must Have"" from one of the greatest entertainers of the last century.  Most would not argue with that assessment."

1645296,B004YV7YH8,Misses the boat...,"I am giving them a two star for the thought.  However, this product seems to miss the boat.  The candy is about the size of a small little M&M, Sweet tarts or Smarties.  They taste like little Sweet Tarts.  You only get 10 tiny cards in the package.  Each card is about the size of a small address mailing label.  It was even hard to get the candy out of the little plastic container.  It's like trying to pop the pill out of a plastic sheet of pills.  The candies do have cute emoticons on them.  Overall, I thought it was a really cute idea that just didn't go very far.  I will not purchase them in the future or recommend the product."

I thought I would take a chance and buy a copy of this flick.  It's not all that and then some.  The movie's nothing more than a glorified porno with a few scenes of violence thrown in.  You'd think they would throw us a bone and have a girl-on-girl scene, not even that!Not worth anyone's time or money.  Just a lot of hot air over nothing.Not recommended."
167898,B00DGZXNOQ,Good for a back up battery.,Arrived quickly and works good as a back up battery. I think my dog got a hold of one of the 2 batteries and it exploded (dog is okay - but burned a hole in my carpet) due to him biting into it. Down to one back up battery (which isnt a big deal as my GN3 rarely consumes a full charge in a day).  Edit 12.25.13..... 2nd battery bit the dust today. Went to put it in the phone and the bottom edge of the battery is missing making it too small to fit the battery cavity or the charger.  Very disapointed with this purchase.  Merry Xmas Hyperion! :^(

3704614,B004P8JMY8,Great treats,"I have a five-pound mini-chihuahua and an 85-pound huge GSP; these are perfect for both of them.  The kneecaps are small enough that the big dog can polish one off in half a day, so there isn't a gooey bone lying around for a week...and the chi chews an hour every day for three days and then it's done.  Both dogs can drag the bones around with no problem.  Local pet food chains want $3.99 each for these--the 'best price' on Amazon was a case of 30 for $49. and free shipping.  The item shipped UPS and was delivered to my door in less than a week...too good a bargain with the gas saving(no trip to store) and price!"

My hubby who is so sweet to eat GF with me, wasn't happy with the taste at all.  I've used this box up with several different sauces and havent been happy with this pasta at all.  I seem to be the odd man out on this, but why eat something with little to no flavor?"

Well when I got the seat coverit was only one, who only buys 1 seat cover? Plus it's not soft to sit on, rather slippery. Butit does fit way better then the picture shows and is better quality then I thought it would be.So I went and ordered the second seat cover for the second bucket seat.

461568,B006SA2EMS,works for me,"I've been taking coQ10 supplements for a while now (a few years), and the one major benefit is that I don't feel sleepy after lunchtime.  Basically helps me through the day without the need for coffee.  One thing I do like about this supplement is that it does not contain magnesium stearate or vegetable stearate, which can cause digestive issues and can slow down the rate of nutritional absorption.  The only ingredient that I might have questions is the organic olive oil and where it is sourced.  Olive oil can be heavily adulterated with other oils.  Most olive oils in the supermarket, are in fact, guilty of being adulterated to some extent.  If it doesn't cost at least $10, then there is a good chance it is adulterated olive oil or a brand that carries some adulterated olive oil in some of their bottles.  Not implying this brand does this of course.  Of all the major brands of vitamin manufacturers, Nutrigold at least appears to be the best in terms of quality.  Although their selection is somewhat limited.There is still some debate about which type of coq10 is better (ubiquinol and obiquonine).  From the research I've read so far the jury is still out.  Some tests on people that took either supplement did not notice any difference between the two or only a little difference.  Some even had digestive problems with ubiquinol (which is the more expensive form of coq10, at the time of this writing).  But there is a lot of hype concerning ubiquinol.  I'll be taking it soon to see if there are any differences.As to the effectiveness of this product compared to other coq10 products I've been taking, I'd say the results of this product is more or less comparable in terms of effect on my health and well being, with the added benefit of not having the negative ingredients in it."

1942488,0783226705,Poor visual quality,The copy of this movie ordered from Just Classic Movies took too long to reach me and the quality of the movie was poor.

I was sorely disappointed and am torn between returning the product and trashing it.
1300040,B0018TIADQ,Cheaply made and not very durable!,"I purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when I placed my guitar in it. Upon close inspection, the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube. The tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe .025&#34; wall, so don't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was. Just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.For $10-11 I did not expect perfection, so to it's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.This stand does have one other good quality- it is CHEAP! Since it was less that $11, I cannot see going through the hassle of returning it. I was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most. The stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but If you need portability and durability- I would definitely purchase a better quality stand."

His poor little tail was so swollen from biting at it and he was even losing hair under his face from scratching.  Once I stopped this product the issues went away.  Again, I never had any issues with this product in the past and I wonder if I really bough Malaseb or was it something else?!"
1867003,B0001MDPOK,"""Pimp the System"" may be the message, this album does not.","If you have heard of Dead Prez before, you've already formulated your opinion about them.  Regardless of the quality of this album, if you do not like their message, nothing (and certainly not any reviews) will make you like this album.  Dead Prez has always been completely focused on there message and you won't escape it on there albums.  If you don't like it, I can understand why this music does not appeal to you.The big difference between this album an their debut is the expectations.  Let's Get Free came out of know where and blew people away.  With RBG, not only did they have to live up to that hype, but the hype around the release of the album.  The 5 Mic rating from the Source before it's shelving, made RBG more desired than it should have been.  As a result people were more than eagerly anticipating a revolutionary album in every sense of the word.That being said the album does not live up to expectations, but from that how could it without being perfect.  But, RBG is a solid album in many ways.  For the most part the production by Stic hits well, laying down dark beats to match the subject matter.  Both Stic and M1 flow really well over both hard-hitting and fast paced tracks.  Lyrically every line is focused on a message, making the quality of their rhymes even better.  Once again, the message does not change and if the revolutionary concept is not for you, you will not like Dead Prez.  Perhaps you can accuse the group of being monotonous, but then again you have to give them credit (how many rappers have an album with no messages or meaning).Both the intro and conclusion work well (Don't Forget where U Came From, Don't Forget where U Goin').  Walk like a Warrior is a pretty nice track, nothing special.  I have a Dream, Too is the most violent song on the album, calling for straight up police brutality, an ok song the message does get lost and jumbled on this song however (""we bout to turn drive-bys revolutionary"").  D.O.W.N. is a solid track.  W-4 & Radio Freq are the highlights of the album, the latter address the popular crap they play on the radio.  F***ed up switches the message to a surprising take on the evil's of alcohol, an impressive somber track.  50 in the Clip is fairly short, easily skippable.  Way of Life is a nice song but fairly short and lacks content to back it up.The downfalls of the album occur far more than they should.  The first being the production tends to blend together, most beats are somber, dark and sound too similar.  It's just not as varied musically as it should.  Radio Freq & Hell-Yeah are the only exceptions.  Which brings up another problem, Hell-Yeah appears on this album 3 different times, which is unnecessary.  Jay-Z appears on the Remix, and rips the track, but at the same time makes you question the integrity of the song.  Jay-Z is certainly one of the best, but he never has come close to ever being militant or revolutionary (let alone gangsta).  Finally the album is only 45 min. long. Take away 2 versions of Hell-Yeah, the intro & outro, and the skits in between its really less than 35 min!!  Illmatic would be missing a lot if it was only 35 min long, so certainly any other album could not pull this off.  This is just too short; it just makes you wonder what happened?  They certainly didn't run out of material seeing as they released two mixtapes in between albums.  All in all nothing really jumps out at the listener, nothing really captivates your attention and with a few exceptions (F***ed up, W-4, Radio Freq) it fails to make you stop and think more than 3 seconds.Overall the album just feels like it lacks the fire of their first album.  If you're a Dead Prez fan, chances are it won't live up to your expectations.  Same goes for those who herd a lot of hype about the album.  Sometimes it is necessary to live up to expectations, especially when you create them for yourself.  Dead Prez didn't really fall off in there talent, production, or message; they just didn't satisfy the army of people that were hungry for more."

Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings.

1588268,B001EQ51NA,"Adequate Jerky, but No Teriyaki Flavor","My biggest complaint is the flavor.  The package says teriyaki, but I got barely a hint of that flavor.  The soy sauce came through most definitely in the saltiness, but you're going to get that kind of flavor in any jerky.  But there was not even a hint of ginger, garlic, and no onion either, none of the flavors I was expecting out of a teriyaki product (both garlic and onion powders are listed in the ingredients, but no ginger).  They need to improve their recipe, or repackage this as regular jerky.The piece size was good, not too big but not tiny little shreds.  The texture was good, pliable, not prickly or crunchy, and easy to get chewing.  I encountered no gristle or otherwise inedible pieces.The packaging is interesting.  I'm told front and back that this is premium beef jerky, but nowhere am I told why it's premium.  There is a pseudo-watermark, again on the front and back, which tells me it's made from grass-fed beef, but does that make it premium?  Or are we just calling it that to make me, the buyer, feel like I'm getting something special?The back of the package says clearly, ""No refrigeration required,"" but smaller type says ""After opening, refrigerate or use within three days.""  Now, I grasp what this means and what needs to be done, but I have no doubt that some consumers will be left stupefied.  This needs to be communicated much more clearly.The product's modest little write-up tells me that the products are ""ready to be eaten...""  Well, duh, that's a good start, for beef jerky.  The text informs me that ""they are made of beef...""  Again, that's more or less what I'd expect out of beef jerky.  And finally, I'm told that it's all ""specially prepared to satisfy the most demanding consumer's need for a delicious meat snack.""  So, how is this specially prepared?  I'd like to hear more about this; maybe this is what makes it ""premium.""  I'm not that demanding, but I did expect that it would taste like teriyaki, which it didn't.  This text is nothing but stock, hollow marketing copy, the kind of stuff that strokes me as a consumer without telling me anything.  IFC: get a better copywriter and improve your narrative.There are a lot of chemicals, with smoke flavor added, and soy and wheat, with caramel color added.  There's MSG, too, along with some emulsifiers and preservatives.As for nutrition, overall it's not too bad.  The entire package contains 320 calories, with 20 of those calories from fat.  The saturated and trans fat numbers are zero, and the cholesterol is relatively low, with the sodium quite high, of course.  There's lots of protein, with good iron content, but precious little else in the way of vitamins.Packaging:  It's easy to open, with a notched starter at the top.  But there is no reseal strip, so you've got to eat it all at once (the cynic in me believes this is the intent) or figure out how you're going to seal it all back up.  A good addition to this package would be a seal.Bottom line: As jerky goes, it's okay.  It's not bad.  But the package says teriyaki, and I've had any number of other companies' teriyaki jerky, and every single one of those has delivered on that promised flavor; this one doesn't even come close."
283144,B000WHNI2I,bought these at the same time as the toothbrush,I wasn't sure I'd have an easy time finding and buying the replacement heads so I purchase these replacement 3-pack because I felt they were a good deal. I like switching out the standard head for the compact head to better reach behind the teeth and in the back molars. Fine product.

3644523,B000WFNQ6S,Best Food for the Price,"Best food I've found for the price.  I buy the Large Breed Puppy and Large Breed Adult for my 2 cane corsos.

Chicken Soup makes their poops consistently solid and they seem to like it just as well as anything else I've bought.  A+"
1675801,B00B9AAI9S,Nice idea but...not my taste,"I loved the idea of a savory tea...imagining it being a warm and cozy treat to enjoy while making dinner or on a cold evening.  And, I had tried Numi products before.  But these savory teas tasted much like I imagine a hot cup of dirt would taste.Very earthy, and not in a pleasant way.  I'm no wimp on teas and drinks...yerba mate is my go-to beverage.  But these taste too weak on the one hand, and the flavor that comes through is not pleasant. Of all, that tomato is the most tolerable, but there's no real enjoyment to be had...I'd rather have plain old Lipton than this."

164776,B00D13066Q,BEST. CASE. YET.,"I love this case, it's sleek, has cut outs for all the buttons and ports, so you don't have to push through plastic to turn off, volume, etc... Even has a cut out for the magnetic dock, which I haven't been able to find one with that yet. Not the most durable...but I have a different case if I need that. It's similar to the wallet case, but much slimmer and the window makes it easy to see the time even when closed. Highly recommend, just don't wipe it down with alcohol (like I do to everything...) or the black will rub off... I just spritz it. Gotta keep those phones clean...they can be dirtier than a toilet seat. As long as you have screen protector on, it's safe to wipe down quickly with alcohol..."

1474869,B004FS8LYK,Too much fighting & gore.. needs more exploring & puzzles,"this game is too focused on killing compared to other tomb raider.. and exploring actual tombs is treated like a side-thing.. when it should be the heart of the game.I preferred the past tomb raider games that had only occasional enemies and little attention on the blood/guts.. with a strong focus on roaming around and collecting artifacts and exploring and solving mysteries.The game is good in a non-tomb raider sense.. and should have been a different title and not use the TR name so as to not interrupt fans that play for the exploration purpose.One of the main reasons why i've played tomb raider games is because the combat was few and far between.. and when you did fight, it was rated pg.. so it didn't gross me out.. but this new game grosses me out and i dont even like looking at it as there is way too much attention put upon the detail of killing.. so much so that it reminds me of horror films and kids should definitely not play this game.i have some friends that use to play this game series because it wasn't too much about killing and now they won't touch it and are so disappointed like me that it's like any other killing action game.This game is not a TR game.  It is a Survival game. it changed genresHopefully the next TR game is a true one and gives me the experience i'm actually looking for.. before some other company takes up the reigns and steals my heart...The company that made this doesn't have the same vision and talent of the original Eidos [edit: Actually it was ""Core"" who designed it. eidos published it] team that started tomb raider.  and that is too bad.I'm sure this game will be a hit, but it could have been a bigger hit as a new ip with a new name..."

1841565,B000002R0R,Transitional British prog from 1977 that really isn't bad,"I have to admit that this 1977 album is really not all that bad in spite of what most people say about Gentle Giant's post In'terview studio output from 1977 to their last gasp in 1980 with the Civilian album.  The Missing Piece shows a band that was trying to move on from the incredibly complex prog they were known for and attempting to update it with musical styles that were ""new and fresh"" in 1977, including more mainstream rock styles and punk rock.  This is especially apparent on the track ""Betcha' thought we couldn't do it"", which is very punkish/new wave sounding in a Gentle Giant kind of way, and at 2'22"" is the shortest track on the album and also the weakest.  As a general trend, the first half of the album seems to cater somewhat to the powers that be that wanted to see Gentle Giant become a commercial and financial success and is poppier (well, as poppy as Gentle Giant could get), while the second half is pretty good - in fact tracks like ""As Old as you are Young"", ""Memories of Old Days"" and ""For Nobody"" are as good as anything off of In'terview (1976), and feature the virtuosity and dense counterpoint that made Gentle Giant such an incredible band.  Although I may be reading way too much into the lyrics, I think Gentle Giant was angry and perhaps a little cynical about the change in the musical climate in the late 1970s.  Certainly, the bitter lyrics to ""Betcha thought we couldn't do it"" describe a band thumbing their noses at a larger audience of pop/punk/new wave music fans that thought them incapable of anything but prog.  The remastering job by DRT is just OK, and the CD features decent sound quality along with the lyrics to the songs, although that is about it - there are no photos of the band or anything informative in the liner notes.  The bonus track is a live version of For Nobody, which was taken from a concert in Cleveland (1977).  Unfortunately, the sound quality is pretty awful - in fact it sounds like a poorly recorded bootleg.  Following this album, Gentle Giant moved in an even poppier direction with albums like Giant for a Day (1978) and Civilian (1980).  To be perfectly honest, I do not own either of these albums, although as a Gentle Giant freak and ""completist"", I may have to bite the bullet and pick them up.  For folks that are new to the band and want to hear Gentle Giant during their creative peak, check out any of the following albums:  Acquiring the Taste (1971); Three Friends (1972); Octopus (1973); In a Glass House (1973); The Power and the Glory (1974); and Free Hand (1975)."

1761325,B001KKRCFA,"Wonderful idea, won't fit my strange toilets","Let's be clear: there is nothing wrong with the construction of this item.  It looks like it would work well.And Customer Service was excellent, responding to an email on a Sunday!But it does not fit my toilet and they don't make one that does.Our toilets are about ten years old.  They have elongated seats, and at the time it was stylish to make the top of the toilet base the same width as the tank.  This puts the left-hand seat bolt about 5.5 inches in from the edge of the base - and the largest distance that their adjustable design will handle is 5.0 inches.&lt;sign>I thought about making it fit by cutting it apart; but I think I'll wait instead until they come out with another model - whenever that is.In any case, the design is brilliantly simple and should work quite well for most toilets."

1829265,B0000025DT,what a great ELO album,"""Tightrope"" begins an upbeat and melodic adventure.  Electric Light Orchestra was something special- they mixed classical with pop rock, and as a result the music sounds loud, shiny, and super melodic.""Telephone Line"" is almost like a ballad.  A real ballad, that makes you cry.  ""Rockaria"" is an updated version of an old 50's style rocker.  Good choice!  ""So Fine"" is a typical mainstream-sounding mid to late 70's rock song.  Because of ELO's talent, it's highly melodic.  Everyone knows ""Livin' Thing"" and ""Do Ya"".  Great songs, especially the rockin' energy of the latter.The bonus tracks are rather sweet as well.  ""Surrender"" RULES.  I absolutely love that song.  The instrumental version of ""Telphone Line"" is pretty awesome, too.  All ELO fans should have this album."

3750046,B000QFVJ5O,"Works well, would buy again!","Way better than my other irons. Like the spoon design much better as it distributes the load over a larger area when applying pressure, even with that I recommend getting a set of Motion Pro 08-0357 Rim Protectors. I used the spoons to take the tire off but did do a little damage to the rim, bought the protectors to use when putting the tire back on and they did their job, no more damage. Also recommend a Motion Pro 08-0471 Bead Buddy II when putting a tire back on, it is your third hand allowing you to focus on putting the tire on an not keeping the part of the tire you already put on."
1297494,B00074B67A,usual immaculate Levy's quality -- but since when is it a receiver holder?,"What's most impressive isn't the top-drawer leather and craftsmanship -- that goes without saying from Levy's.  it's the clever design, the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap, adjusts to almost any position, and adjusts to (almost) any small wireless transmitter.  transmitter, not receiver!"

3755397,B002RW244Y,Great Mirrors!!,"I have had these mirrors for over 1 year and have not had the first problem.  When I got my truck I didn't want those big towing mirrors, so I tried these out.  Once you get them adjusted they will stay adjusted unless you push them with your thumb while taking them off like I do sometimes.  Also do not over tighten because they will start moving around a little bit.  But once you mastered on how much pressure to put them on with they stay put. I highly recommend them.  I drive a 2007 Toyota Tundra and they fit right over the standard mirrors  perfectly."
80815,B007G51XOO,does not hold charge,"This indicated it could charge a device for 5 hours - I have never had more than 20 - 40 minutes of charge. I've used this 3x and each time I charged the unit fully. I specifically got it for a work trip in Europe. The first time I went to use it, the charge was completely gone. I figured that maybe somehow it was accidentally turned on - even though it was stored in a spot in my backpack where that was very unlikely. Anyay, I tried 3 more times to use this and each time I was able to rapidly charge a dead iphone to 30-50% in just 20-30 minutes, then the unit was drained. I was intermittently using my phone at the time, but not heavy usage.Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the power indicator never seems to accurately reflect how much juice is left; I have had 1/4 of ring lit, and yet I'll get my phone to 50% charged. Sometimes, it won't light up at all and it will charge my phone the same amount.It's really too bad - the unit seems sturdy and is not that big to carry around. Maybe my unit's defective? Huge disappointment"
1302249,B00466HM28,OK for the price and USB connection without interface needed,Works as advertised but the keys are stiff. Pads take too much presure to activate. Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.After the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless. Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed. I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one. I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.Not recommending this product.
3621290,B000AUJFHE,You would think it would be perfect...,"We have two other ""Yeowww!"" catnip toys which our cats both adore.The first night we had them, they were fighting over them.Then came the banana.Neither cat will touch this toy!One cat looked at it and walked away. The other one sniffed it, walked around it and left. Hasn't shown interest since.We've had it long enough for them to be used to it.I thought maybe we just got one with ""dead"" catnip. It smells like catnip to me, but then the toyisn't for me! I thought they would love the shape, since they both love to chew and kick with toys.Not this one. I tried pinching the banana to see if I could crush some of the nip, making it stronger.Nothing. No response.I don't know if we just got a ""bad banana"" with old catnip, or what, but neither catwants anything to do with it.Sad, because it was much more expensive than the other Yeowww toy that they fight over!Bummer...UPDATE Jan 27, 2012:Well, time has passed and neither cat will even touch this toy!They are still going strong for their other Yeowww! toys, so I have no ideawhy this was such a bomb, unless the catnip arrived DOA."

3533057,B00CFPC8EO,Reviews may not be accurate - CAUTION!,"I take writing reviews very seriously and my primary goal is to give other movie buffs an honest opinion of what I liked and what I didn't like.  As I read through the reviews of this movie, I'm amazed at the ALL 5 STAR ratings - I've never seen a movie with a solid 5, have you?  Curious?  Me too.  I looked at every review on the first screen for the movie Forgetting the Girl and found EVERY ONE OF THEM had only 1 review ""under their belt"".  Which one?  Forgetting the Girl.  Although well-written, why would all the reviewers only have this movie reviewed?  Coincidence or are we being tricked into believing this is the sleeper of the year - a diamond in the rough - the be all end all movie of all time.......I doubt that is the case.  Almost fell for it though."
1335115,B00006F2ZS,Don't Forget To Blink...Game Causes Dry Eyes,"If you're a long-time DDR player, the rating should be closer to five or more stars; it's gonna be a gamble with first-timers, but four stars should be accurate.What is DDR? Players face a screen with four directional arrows lined horizontally at the top; as arrows come up from the bottom of the screen, players must hit either their dance pads or controllers at the same moment the incoming arrows line up with the top arrows. To music, and often times, a very active background. The basic idea is simple enough, but the challenge never gets old.DDR players familiar with the older mixes generally available at the arcades should see Max as a significant upgrade over all other versions. The music is significantly better. Those who were hesitant to dance to So Many Men, Silent Hill, or After The Game of Love--out of the sheer fear of not only playing a strange game, but to an embarrassingly titled or uncool song--will have plenty of new options. New songs such as the Aurora re-mix of Wham!'s Ordinary World, Darude's Sandstorm, Steve Rhyner's Dark Black Forest, Insertion, Healing Vision and many others, are songs you wouldn't be ashamed to have playing in your car, or would expect to hear at the club.There are newer challenges. There are freezes, which involve stepping on a single arrow for an extended period of time--Ordinary World is an excellent song to try this on--or moments where the pacing changes dramatically. Healing Vision starts of extremely slow, perhaps less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) then accelerating to the high hundreds after the first pair of arrows. Expect the game to freeze the movements in mid-song of a fast song as well.There are several new modes, although the clever and entertaining battle mode from the fourth mix is missing. Basic features such as a practice mode that allows you to try harder songs at harder levels all the way through without being failed are still there, as well as the double mode; two players in versus mode can still pick different skill levels simultaneously.What's the challenge? As usual, you continue to aim for higher scores, more &quot;perfect&quot; steps, and the ever elusive AAA rating. Playing the game over and over and getting higher and higher scores and ratings for all songs opens up new songs and modes for you; be sure to have a memory card.From experience, it's best to look for a pad with a stronger, hard plastic covering that doesn't shift under your feet when you play--they are available. Those who have tired of using the pad will find that controller play is just as interesting, and can be extremely challenging when first playing multiple-freeze songs.And yes, don't forget to blink. Your eyes will get dry."

1886127,B00IDXIP1M,Reductive,"Honestly, this whole folk-pop wave is getting out of control. It all started with Hey Ho! by the Lumineers, then everyone wanted to jump on the Americana bandwagon, from EDM superDJ Avicii (Wake Me Up!) to pop-rap's resident sleazebag (Timber) and British newcomers Passenger and Bastille. I would like just a little more diversity on the pop airwaves please."
1733033,B000K9V12W,Think twice before you buy this set...,"First of all the bit set is made in China... Wow, what a surprise!!! I thought it will be like Katana, Freud or MLCS (like it supposed to be) - made in USA at lease, but not in China.Secondly, the bits are NOT SHARP at all. They look like (actually they are) sharpened by hand file. The cutting edges have small splinters, a tiny spikes that tears and burns the wood in place of clear cut. I'm disappointed... The only good thing in this set is nice and solid wooden box that I'm going to use for my router bits. I don't recommend this set."
3707900,B004X3VQ5I,Good For Them But My Dogs Don't Really Like,"These treats aren't bad, but they're not my dogs' preferred treat.  We have three of them and they're pretty much in agreement.  We usually give them something before we leave the house for an extended period of time and they'll generally get distracted and start chowing down and not even notice us.  When we gave them these, they just sort of looked at them and then looked back at us as if to say ""That's it?"".That being said, when we've given it to them and stayed around, they will chew on them and seem to enjoy themselves.  They're also good for them, providing the calcium that a lot of dogs are lacking.  There's a good number of them in the pouch to keep the doggies happy.  They're probably better on their teeth than the moister ones they like better.I'm torn on what to give these as a review.  As I mentioned, they're not the ones that our dogs get really excited about, but on the other hand they do get chewed on and they seem like they'd stay ""fresh"" for a long time.  They're a decent product we'd probably buy again.  I'd really suggest getting a small quantity first though to make sure your dogs will eat them."

1880197,B002QB190Q,7/10 (3.5/5),"Alright let me start by saying, how dope is that cover? I mean it's nothing special, it's just him wit a mean mug on, but I don't know I just really like it. Alright so this is Jeezy's fourth project and we all know how much this has been pushed back. Almost to the point where it became annoying. And in turn it kind of killed my hype for the album. But it's here, so that's all that counts right?From his last album to the release of this one we've seen Jeezy release a string of mostly mediocre mixtapes, with a dope one every now and then. We've also seen him release a bunch of promotional singles. Some which are on the Deluxe Edition, some which were left off entirely. As a whole the album really isn't all that bad. Is it his best work? No. Is it a proper follow up to ""The Recession""? Honestly, no.Production wise it's your typical southern album. In terms of subject matter it's like his first 2 albums. He has some songs about drinkin', drugs, sex, him just spittin' bars, and a deep song or two. But in today's world that's honestly nothing new. But it works. I mean for Jeezy it just works. He's one of those rappers that you can't expect too much from. You just expect some dope music. And that's what he does on this album, for the most part.A couple things I found odd/terrible. Track 13 ""Higher Learning (Feat. Snoop Dogg, Devin The Dude & Mitchellel)"" obviously it's a track about smoking weed, but it's just bad. It throws off the whole flow of the album. So I'm glad it was at the end. Track 10 ""Trapped (Feat. Jill Scott)"" it had potential to be my favorite song on the album, but there's two sections where Jill Scott tries to... I guess we can say ""rap"" and it's terrible. At the very begining of the song before Jeezy comes in she has one of these ""rap"" section and she says ""whack sauce"". ""Whack sauce""? Really? Every time I hear the song and she says that I cringe. And it's sad because she does amazing on the hook, but whatever.Standout Songs: ""Waiting"" & ""F.A.M.E. (Feat. T.I.)""Overall Score: 7/10 - In short it's a nice Jeezy album. It's Jeezy doing his thing, and for the most part it's what we've come to expect from him. As I've said before I don't feel it's a proper follow up album to ""The Recession"" but I'll just wait patiently for him to make another album like that."

1375584,B000G0LE0Y,Unfairly treated; an anti-bandwagon review.,"Is this the best-made Sonic game? No. Is this one of my faves? Yes.Sonic 2006 takes a whole new epic, slightly-more mature turn of events on the story. People who say this is cheesy obviously don't care much for Sonic to begin with. This game was amazing when I played it, and today it's graphics are still incredible, at least for the cutscenes. The overall gameplay isn't bad, just takes some getting used to. Sonic has a few annoying high-speed levels and Shadow's vehicle controls take awhile to get used to, but if ANYBODY has a shred of patience and willing to try out different STYLES of gameplay, then they'll enjoy it.Sonic 2006 has a similar theme to Sonic Adventure 1, spending time running about towns in an RPG-like style, and I like it. It feels like you're more in control of the characters. There's some fun town missions, and overall a great experience as a true Sonic fan.If you wanna whine and complain about it being too clumsy, yes it takes some adjusting, but it's beatable and masterable. Give it a chance, haters. If you keep failing, maybe you just suck."

Since he absolutely hates feeling like a hairy beastie he tasks me with doing his haircut and trimming.Before the Remington BHT600 Body and Back Groomer we were stuck in the dark ages, equipped with a simple 14 dollar hair trimmer by Remington which I would also then use to try to shave and tidy up the rest of him. Well, those blades are a little rough on sensitive skin and they get pretty hot. It did the job, but sometimes caused discomfort.Enter the Body and Back Groomer, thanks to Remington and the Vine program we got to test this baby out for the last trimmings.The good:- multidirectional trimming which actually WORKS.- no skin irritation at all with the foil shaver (which I used on his back and neck)- adjustable trimmer worked through his thick, curlyish chest hair, although needing frequent dehairing of the comb- works as well in the water as it does on dry hairThe bad:- it should have seemed obvious to me, but the trimmer will not work except for on a charge. Inotherwords, you cannot plug it in and use it. Silly me, that whole waterproof claim..should have sent up a clue.- travel case? um, no that is a simple mesh bag which really doesn't do it for me. So I sprung for a 50 cent pencil container from my local box mart and stuck the shaver and its attachments in there. Viola!- the adjustable trimmer to reach the back? Nah, I would not buy that unless you are super flexible or don't have a well built back like my husband. He'd have to dislocate a shoulder to pull that off. if he actually had to lift a finger during the process, that is.. :)The final verdict? DH loved the trimmer. He also loves being spoiled haha.As a side note here - probably not the gift to give for the woman in your life. Hiring a trimmer operator for a wooly husband is not something that you will get by dropping subtle hints like a Remington stuck in a Christmas stocking. Instead, try wearing tank tops out in public and when she starts to suggest wearing t-shirts instead sweetly suggest she take on the job. :D That's how I was suckered!"
1847315,B0000087NS,"Totally Hot is indeed, totally hot","Any guy alive in 1978 remembers Olivia decked out in black leather during the final scenes of Grease. Totally Hot was her own musical release follow-up album after the movie Grease became a mega-selling big deal. But ONJ, being the talent that she is, didn't just throw together some sloppy songs, toss the black leather on, and try to sell it to the public while she was in the spotlight. What she did do was assemble another in a long line of outstanding albums filled with the top stuido musicians of the era and her trademark soulful, sultry, heavenily voice. While many of her earlier albums are soft and subtle, Totally Hot has a lot of spunk. It's just a fun record. It sounds like she had a great time belting out these tunes, and as a listener in my opinion it really comes across. The funky and playful title track kind of summarizes the album. It's not too serious, yet it's Olivia getting comfortable as a ""sex symbol"" while maintaining her innocent charm at the same time. Other standout tracks include ""A Little More Love,"" ""Please Don't Keep Me Waiting,"" ""Deeper Than the Night,"" and  ""Dancin' Round and Round."""

3747765,B000E2CVIS,Disappointing - Not the same K&N filters from a few years ago,"These filters now come from Korea/China, etc. They are no longer USA made. I have read on some forums that when the manufacturing moved overseas that the filtration percentage has also decreased. For the price they are charging, it doesn't seem worth it anymore. I usually stick with OEM filters, which is what I did for my VFR. Yes, the 17mm nut is nice, but I'm not going to spend more and risk filtration for ease of install."

It is worth the price, but there is absolutely no fancyness in it. Plain black plastic.  Very plain but funtional. The pump does have plently of power. It does need to be weigh down which is really no problem."
1699338,B00005AUXJ,Love at First Cut,"Always finding them too expensive I had never hoped to buy a compound miter saw. But the apparent quality of a nice looking Delta for $79.00 was hard to pass up, though I knew something was probably wrong and then I would be hooked on the dam thing. Sure enough, the value of a too-cheap to be true saw was revealed in the angle cuts. The machine was obviously Not True, so I returned it and started some more serious looking, this time with a square in my pocket. Measuring shelf displays only gives a rough idea, but it's a start, I.E. I got suspicious of any saw minus a blade or that had a bolted-on display blocking the throat. When I spotted the DeWalt, it was simply the only choice for the money, bang-on accurate just sitting there. The same was true when I set it up, most impressive. It was also one of the few saws that swung beyond 45 degrees each way, I don't know if that will be important someday or not. It is also one of the only saws that has a separate steel plate for the table index, all the others are cut or cast into the base. This will be important someday. So far it's a pleasure to use, and yes, the dust collector is funky and knocks stuff over. All features are exactly as I would want, built in wrench holder, easy access to the blade, excellent finish. It seems lasers are still the new fad, but it also seems unequipped models are becoming less expensive. Maybe a ""pro"" could find fault, but the DW703 has my vote.**************Three years later, it's still going strong. Having now been dragged into the commercial arena, (did I say, ""pro""?) this saw still dispatches itself with honor. I have used it on-site for four fences and three gates, and while the blade size is a little challenging for larger posts, the accuracy, size and durability still make it a great choice."

By the second season the base had fatigued and cracked in a circular manner and by the third season I had to remove it from service because I felt it would not safely hold the weight of the tongue.  I was pretty disappointed considering how much I spent and inconvenient is was to store away.  I've moved on to the &#34;Flip-foot&#34; jack extension."

2658569,B0000C23HY,Sheer Theatre,"This is a great production of a great musical play. To start with, it was produced with the participation and approval of the original composers families. The stage design was fairly simple visually, letting the actors and music tell the story without interference, but clearly placing the setting in turn of the (20th) century Midwest.Then, There's that cast. Pure O.D. talent. This is the first time that the singer hero, heroine, and villain were the same actors as the dancer hero, heroine, and villain in the ballet scene of any Oscar and hammerstein musical. The character parts were each and every one outstanding,too. There was not a single moment during the show when you could realize that the actors were all british. The illusion of being in Oklahoma was perfect. Particular credit is due to Hugh Jackman. He played Curly as a true western character down to the least mannerism while singing up a storm. It was only after hearing him speak in his true cockney voice during the commentaries that I realised the full scope of his performance.This show is a landmark in the history of musical theatre, but you should buy it because, in final analysis, it's just a whole lot of fun!"

1865496,B0000CC6QG,"Great Songs, But Flawed Compliation","After 12 years, 7 albums and countless singles, here appears the first ever compilation of Tori Amos. &quot;Tales of a Librarian&quot; (20 songs; 78 min., plus bonus DVD) is neither a &quot;best of&quot; nor a &quot;greatest hits&quot; but simply a compilation of great Tori Amos songs.The first half of the album is the &quot;rockier&quot; one, with such classics as &quot;Precious Things&quot; (Tori's best song ever?), &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Spark&quot;, &quot;Crucify&quot; and the new song &quot;Angels&quot; which sounds straight out of &quot;Scarlet's Walk&quot;. The second half is the more reflective half, with &quot;Mr. Zebra&quot;, &quot;Me and a Gun&quot;, &quot;Baker Baker&quot; and the new ballad &quot;Snow Cherries from France&quot;, quite beautiful.The problem with this compilation is that it ignores, for whatever reason, the latter part of Tori's career: only 1 song (&quot;Bliss&quot;) from the terrific &quot;To Venus and Back&quot;, nothing from &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot; and, due to contractual label issues, also nothing from last year's &quot;Scarlet's Walk&quot;. That means only 1 song from Tori's last 5 years! Also missing from earlier albums are essential songs/hits such as &quot;Caught a Light Sneeze&quot; and &quot;Hey Jupiter&quot;. Why?The bonus DVD puzzles me completely. Sure, the 3 songs on it (recorded at a soundcheck on Tori's 2003 summer tour) are terrific, in particular &quot;Honey&quot;, with Matt Chamberlain (drums) and Jon Evans (bass) providing excellent support. However, considering that a DVD can contain 3+ hours of content, we get 15 minutes?? What is the point of that?"

1300278,B001GH4H3W,Small package does the job.,"This little jewel is so small it can hide in your hand, but it delivers decent tone at a decent volume to your headphones for practicing indoors or outdoors over traffic sounds even. Its 1/4"" TS plug goes directly into your bass's instrument cable jack, and it has one 1/8"" TRS output jack for your headphone plug. But it also has a second 1/8"" TRS input jack which allows you to connect your computer or mp3 player or cell phone so you can hear yourself playing over play-alongs or any such music source, both directly into your headphones.Its on-off switch has a third position for overdrive distortion, which I never use. It has both gain and volume output controls and both work. It also has a tone control but I cannot discern that it does anything. Could be that I just have a defective sample, but I don't care because the tone is fine just as it is.Others have described this little headphone amp as seeming somewhat fragile, and I don't argue with that--it does feel a bit thinly made and the 2xAAA battery door does seem weak. But I just take a little extra care not to drop it or bang it around in a gig bag. If the battery door eventually falls off, I'll use duct tape, and when this little thing completely wears out, I'll buy another. It's just too handy and easy to travel with not to own--and, as I said, it does the job.EDIT 2013-04-07: Still working fine."
3618361,B0009YHTA6,"So, so flimsy","I don't know if I just got a bad one, but this toy was SO dang flimsy. I have one dog who guts toys and one who treats them like babies. Even cheap, seemingly poorly made toys will last a LONG time with him, normally only developing tears/holes after months if not years (yes, his babies are kept locked away from his destructive ""sister""). I bought this platypus mostly because I thought he might like the game of finding the eggs. He's not the brightest bulb in the bunch and absolutely did not understand it-- but my dog's lack of problem-solving skills is not why I'm rating this poorly. Why then? Because every single egg we were sent developed giant tears in a matter of days. He was NOT at all rough on them, they were just sewn very poorly. Did he, despite his absolute confusion about the ""game"", enjoy carrying around the platypus and eggs (well, once we freed them for him, anyway)? Yes, he did... and that's why it gets two stars instead of one. But having all the eggs split open and start oozing stuffing after such a short time, when this dog can leave a dollar store stuffed animal unmarred for months, was a vast disappointment. For this reason alone, I wouldn't recommend this toy."

1886103,B00HS7BZIE,Where The Pavement Ends,"Anyone familiar with Real Estate's sound should know what to expect: jangly guitars, smooth mid-range vocals, and lyrics that resonate a pining for a simpler life.  With Atlas, Real Estate pick up where they left off with Days but this time the themes are explored more deeply.  With Martin Courtney now married, the focus on Atlas shifts slightly from Real Estate's past repertoire; on this record, Martin and the band are very much rooted in the present.Had To Hear &#8211; A nice little lead riff leads in a song that recalls the debut album but through the clean production lens of Days.  This track sets the tone for the rest of the album.Past Lives - Arguably the most Yo La Tengo-esque track on the album, a warm 70's keyboard and ride cymbal keep tempo as Martin laments over memories of the long-lost suburbs, in keeping with Real Estate tradition.Talking Backwards - It's obvious why this song was chosen as the single.  The fastest, most uptempo track of the bunch, Talking Backwards is an instant classic and shows how much the band has grown in the last year.April's Song - An instrumental that sounds like montage music for a bunch of people having a good time on a road trip.  This song will find its place on many mix CDs to come.  Blissful, hazy perfection.The Bend - The background sounds like a chorus of crickets giving this track major nighttime vibes.  Easily the most introspective track on the album.Crime - Reminiscent of that early-90's hit &#34;Big Me&#34; by Foo Fighters.  Intricate riffs and pleasant echoey chords abound.  Long live the electric guitar.Primitive &#8211; This song could very possibly be the next single.  A bit more melancholy than their usual fare but when the chorus rolls around, it's such a sweet relief.How Might I Live - Was this song recorded in 1972?  Everything about this song smacks of the era's nature-obsessed folk rock (in the best way possible, of course) with Bleeker's twangy voice taking center stage.Horizon &#8211; Fresh off the down-South folkiness of the last track, Horizon retains a very western folk guitar and bass interplay that complement the vocals nicely with pastoral lyrics that tie the whole thing together.Navigator - The chorus breathes and really let's the lyrics sink in. The tableau is one of minute beauty.  &#34;Cross the kitchen floor / steal out the back door / past the monument / I'll meet you where the pavement ends.&#34; Like a short story by Raymond Carver, this song isn't so much about what is said but rather what has been left unsaid.Despite the fact that Real Estate's guitar playing will always sound wistful and classic in a way very few bands can pull off, Atlas seems to shy away from the overtly nostalgic intentions of Days, instead focusing on a new chapter of life; one fraught with miscommunication (Talking Backwards), occasional regression (Past Lives), and reluctantly forging a path into adulthood (Crime).  As Real Estate continues to hone in on their sound, the production only grows more lush and the songs more meaningful.  We'll be hearing from the guys for a long, long time."

1871820,B000AL730O,Music Okay; Lyrics and Singing NOT Okay,"There are two particular problems here: First, music this minimalist needs lyrics that are incisive or clever or at least interesting in some way. These lyrics are consistently banal and in many cases inane. Second, McCartney's singing voice appears to be tired or ravaged by age or overuse. His lowest pitches (and none are THAT low) sound strained, and his higher pitches, which are mostly taken falsetto, sound thin and weak. His intonation is generally faulty; he is often painfully out of tune. Oddly enough, his singing seems to deteriorate as the record wears on, almost as if it had been recorded sequentially in one session, as I doubt it was.There are chord relations in the first three songs (although only briefly in the first) that I never expected to find in a McCartney song. Possibly someone finally pointed out to McCartney that John Lennon's and George Harrison's Beatles songs were generally much more harmonically adventurous than his and he is seeking belatedly to even the score or possibly he is letting himself be influenced by David Bowie or by people who were themselves influenced by David Bowie. The opening of each stanza of ""This Never Happened Before"" (""I'm very sure/this never happened to me before"") derives directly from Burt Bacharach, and McCartney unfortunately lacks the compositional technique to develop Bacharach's motive--or else he's too lazy to try. ""A Certain Softness"" is more or less reminiscent of Thomas Dolby's reading of ""I Scare Myself"" or perhaps of Brian Ferry going thirties-Latin. An otherwise pleasant-enough melody is destroyed by singing so out of tune on the critical last line of each verse that it is nearly impossible to tell what pitches were intended. ""Follow Me"" surrounds with filler some bits taken from George Harrison songs.The best things about this record are Joby Talbot's tasteful, unobtrusive string arrangements and the remarkable clarity with which it has been recorded. There ought to be a law against letting McCartney touch a fipple flute, however. He murders the instrument on ""English Tea"" just as he once murdered it on ""Fool on the Hill"". The liner notes tend to be very specific--fussy, let's say--about instruments played, and although I think a ""A Fine Line"" one of the better songs, I'm a little saddened to learn the piano that McCartney is beating up here--banging out chords on--is an expensive, refined, and delicate Bosendorfer. Speaking of beatings, the booklet-back lengthy paragraph admonishing us not to make copies of this record (which I notice below is being blithly ignored) includes this sentence: ""By [sic] carrying out any of these actions it [sic] has the same effect as stealing music."" I don't know who is responsible for mangling the English language in this way, but I shouldn't be surprised to discover it to be the author of the lyrics on this disc; I find a stylistic consistency."

1544367,B000E1DSPE,For those who really can't stand the sight of vegetables,"Kraft Mac & Cheese Vegi original tastes like cauliflower.  You can't see it, but it's there.  And it's delicious.  But then, I like vegetables.  In fact, if I was searching for something good to eat, I would probably cook a box of macaroni alongside a pot of ACTUAL vegetables.  I would certainly get more nutrients that way.It seems as if this product is being marketed toward people who don't get enough vegetables in their diet, and therefore need them to be inserted into something they already eat.  Kind of like V8 Splash.  It's good for you, but it doesn't LOOK like it is! Score!!Yet, Vegi Original still tastes very much like vegetables, so unless the SIGHT of veggies is the only thing that offends you, you're not going to be able to get past the cauliflowery taste.Let's face it, Kraft Mac & Cheese (any kind) is delicious, but unless you prepare it with half the butter and non-fat milk, it's really not very good for you.  Even if there IS ""1/2 a serving"" of cauliflower thrown in.  You'd be better off just eating your darn vegetables straight up.But hey, Kraft enthusiasts, give it a try.  You might like it more than the original!  I found them to be pretty equal.  Yum."

I've played and beaten the original Mega Man 1-8, and have also played and beaten Mega Man X1-8.  The other side games like Mega Man soccer, the gameboy games, etc, I have not played but I decided to finally try Mega Man ZX for DS thinking it would be great.  Let me tell you it definitely is not.First, the graphics are pretty lowsy at best.  In fact, these are Super Nintendo graphics for goodness sakes and for a DS game I expect more.  I just got done playing Mario 64 which looks to be an exact port from the N64.  Then to play this trashy looking game is depressing.Second, the game play seems promising but it isn't.  All you do is run around over the same areas over and over and over and over and over doing minute mindless tasks.  Why the hell can they not stick with the same chemistry that has worked for 20 years?!  I bought this game expecting the classic Mega Man game and it is far from that.Finally, the game is extremely kiddy.  So, kitty that I actually can't stand it.  When you complete a task you get a...teddy bear?  WTF is that all about?  What was great about the X-series was it was a little more grown up.Avoid this game seriously.  Hopefully Nintendo will come out with a X-Collection pack for DS so I can enjoy the classics."

1833903,B000002GXG,Happy Recklessness,"Once I heard that this album featured performances from people like Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, Larry Carlton, Alex Acu&ntilde;a (called Alejandro here), Don Alias and Chaka Khan, I just knew I had to have it. Mitchell was reportedly coming to the end of her contract with Asylum records when she made the record and figured she could be as experimental and loose as she pleased. She didn't hold back and the album mainly deals with themes of recklessness, destructive relationships, alcoholism and despair. Not that you'd know this at first listen as musically, Mitchell manages to keep things sounding relatively upbeat.As anyone familiar with the work of Pastorius might expect, there are lots of yawning (and thumping) bass lines and they are coupled with plenty of guitar riffs, African-inspired rhythms (Haitian maybe?), a sprinkling of jazz manoeuvrings and multi-layered vocals. It's interesting. The glorious 16mins 21secs long ""Paprika Plains"" sounds like the score to a movie and the booming title track is simply breathtaking. Mitchell plays a mean guitar.Pastorius and Shorter were both members of Weather Report at the time this album was made and the band was then at the height of its powers. Pastorius went on to play alongside Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays and Michael Brecker on Mitchell's 1979 live albumShadows and Light. (He'd played on Metheny's brilliant debut,Bright Size Life, the year before THIS album was made). Shorter went on to become a frequent Mitchell collaborator. All songs were written by Joni Mitchell, except for ""The Tenth World"", which is by Joni Mitchell, Don Alias, Manolo Badrena, Alejandro Acuna, Airto and Jaco Pastorius.""Don Juan's Reckless Daughter"" was released in December 1977 to mixed reviews, but peaked at #25 on the Billboard charts and attained gold record status within three months, which isn't to be sniffed at. I'm guessing though, that the album is much more appreciated now than it was when it was first released. Every Joni Mitchell CD I've experienced so far has offered something fun and something different, with her joyful voice and rich lyricism remaining the one constant. She's a unique talent indeed; no wonder she's revered as much as she is.As much fun as this one is, I'm already looking forward to my next Joni Mitchell album."
3749778,B000NPR33O,Cheap but working perfectly for 2007 bmw335i sedan filter cap.,I bought it for 2007 bmw335i sedan filter change.  It matches and works perfectly  Great torque as described.  Highly recommended for people looking practical products.
3761574,B00CCOBOI4,Not one of 3M's best products,"Let me make one thing perfectly clear. I have a very nice shiny black luxury car.  I thought I'd check this system out to see if it would help me keep my car shiny and protect the finish.  The simple answer is - yes it will protect it but you won't like the way it looks.  I tested this on a small part of my car's hood first and it was difficult to spray without dimpling.  Then, once the finish is on, it makes my shiny black car look like it is covered with gray film - not at all what I wanted.  I think this may just be a problem with shiny jet black cars and may be less visible on other colors.  I think it would protect the underlying finish but you just may not like the way it looks."

1759965,B001GS6LDA,"This light breaks, often","The one I bought off Amazon in Jan. 2012 broke before I had it for very long, maybe 2 months.  When bending the arm, it would go out.  Then it quit working completely.  It was too late to return it to Amazon when it started doing this.  So I emailed the manufacturing company, Ritelite.  It took a little over a month for them to send me 2 replacement lights for free.  I got them around the middle of April, 2012.  The first one started doing the same thing again last night (Aug.19, 2012).  So if you want a nice little light that will break in 4 months, go ahead and buy this thing.  This last one also seemed to be harder on batteries, which was annoying because it would just get dimmer quickly.  I have a drawer full of half used Energizer and Duracell batteries.So I have one more of these lights left, and then I'm done with it.  I guess I will have 3 battery operated USB ports when all is said and done, but likely won't have a working light.  If I could now rate it less than 1 Star I would.  Someday I am going to tear one of them apart to see if I can see what the issue is, but it would be my guess that there are wires inside the flex arm that are fraying over time, which is probably due to poor insulation on the wires -- just a hunch.Nov. 2012 -- the last one I had is still working because I quit using it in my laptop which was the main thing I wanted it for.  I use it as a nightlight when needed, or mini flashlight and don't bend it much.  Duracell Ultra Power batteries last longer in it.  Never used it much as a book light; it seems bulky for that.March 2013:  The last one is now dying.  This is one of the most annoying products I have ever purchased.  I will never buy anything from Ritelite again."

Though I have not played it offline but once(which I did not think much of). The online play is the most awsome experience that a RE freak like myself could ever want. Though the game would be a litlle better if it included a headset(voice chat) option, because the game requires a very strategy base and there is no why to talk to players except in the chat rooms before play. Though while playing the game you can mash the square button and the character will say a random phrase for the situation that you are curently in(most of the things that they say are laugh out loud funny). But dont take my word for it. If you are the slightest bit of an RE fan and have online play. Get your butt up and go buy this you will not be dissapointed, trust me."

It really does stay cool unlike a lot of the chargers that get real hot.  I recommend this charger.
2788829,B00097E70I,clever social satire,"""Straight-Jacket"" is a very funny satire showing what it must have been like for closeted homosexual actors living and working in Hollywood in the 1950`s (and who`s to say it`s really that much better now?).  Matt Letscher stars as Guy Stone, a matinee idol along the lines of Rock Hudson, who leads a tricky double life.  To the public at large he's a macho superstar heartthrob, the fantasy love object of women the world over, all of whom dream of being the one to finally strip him of his status as filmdom`s ""most eligible young bachelor.""  In his private life, he spends most of his time prowling the bar scene for the next available hunk.  In fact, Guy is so shallow that he doesn't even bother to learn the names of the star-struck men he sleeps with.  Desperate to get the lead role in the upcoming epic ""Ben-Hur,"" Guy agrees to enter into a sham marriage with a nave young secretary working at the studio (she is unaware of Guy`s sexuality and believes he actually loves her).  Soon we're deep into a laugh-filled version of ""Far From Heaven,"" with Guy struggling to maintain interest in his new heterosexual lifestyle, a charade that becomes even more difficult after he meets the man of his dreams, an idealistic young writer named Rick Foster, who makes Guy think twice about the life of deceit he's leading.Director Richard Day has written a script (based on his own stage play) filled with lacerating wit, hilarious puns (starting with the title of the movie and the name of the main character) and absurdist situations.  He casts a scathing eye not only on anti-gay prejudice but on Tinsel Town phoniness, Red-baiting and superficial relationships as well.  The movie shimmers with the bright, shiny look of `50's films, while the sets and costumes capture the period with rib-tickling fidelity (Guy`s peeling himself off a plastic, slip-covered sofa is priceless).  The actors are all wonderful in their roles, particularly Letscher as Guy, Carrie Preston as his perfect little wife, Victor Raider-Wexler as the studio head and, above all, Veronica Cartwright (the young girl in ""The Birds""), absolutely hilarious as Guy's understanding but pragmatic agent whose job it is to make sure Guy's career and hers don't suddenly come crashing down in flames around them.""Straight-Jacket"" is really a story about a man's coming to terms with reality, accepting himself for who he is, and changing society a little bit for the better in the process - with the Red Scare references serving mainly as allegorical allusions to the homophobia of today.  This thematic layering is what makes ""Straight-Jacket"" one of the sharpest and most thoughtful movie comedies in a long time."

It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However, animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."

1297167,B0002OOMW6,Cleans real good,"Lemon has been known for quite some generations to be a good cleaning solvent because of its acidic nature and this certainly does the job. As the label warns: do NOT to use on Maple-wood frets (mostly Fender strats) due to the softer & lighter quality. It is only for the harder, darker woods like mahogany (which I have) or ebony (high quality - i.e. expensive - used best for fretless). The solution is perfect, but the applicator (attached to the neck of the bottle) could be better. I would rather take the neck applicator out and apply lightly using a 100% cotton cloth.This solution has been made specifically for use on guitars, though I think you could find a similar lemon oil cleaner cheaper at local stores. It's only 4-oz, but what little is used each time, this bottle should last the guitar owner his/her life."

Promoting this thing as a hair cutting device amounts to fraud.

I just don't get any kinda of vibe from this album. Even though Dreamline and Ghost of a Chance are good songs, the rest seems like filler material. I give it two stars for those two good songs, but otherwise I really can't recommend this. If you want Rush from the 1990's, go with Counterparts. Its easily a 5 star effort and the best from that decade"

The litter itself does have a smell to it, but it smells like tree trunk, branches, natural ingredients. It's natural, so it's going to have a natural, woody smell to it.It clumps and keeps pooh covered.I wouldn't recommend letting the pee balls roll around the box, cause it will eventually break a part. If you roll the box the way your supposed to, the litter holds very well.I also recommend the Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter box. AWESOME!!!

I have several phones and have tried Otterbox cases with every one of them and I'm still wondering what people are talking about when they say it's ""a great case"".  This one is no different from other Otterbox cases I have tried.  I am disappointed with this case.  Fit is sloppy.  The rubber seems too soft and pliable and does not stay in place.  Recharging batteries in smart phones should be done without a case in order to keep the temperatures of the battery as low as possible and removing the case is easy but installing it will find you fighting with overly soft rubber parts that get mangled until you play with it for quite a while.  I find it uncomfortable to hold the phone to my ear because of the plastic edges on the case and all around quality seems lacking.  I don't get the hype."

Doubting that two in a row could be bad, I tried the ""recommended"" alkaline batteries.  Low and behold, both lights worked.  I checked the rechargeable batteries and they tested as fine.  That is, this light works EXCLUSIVELY with alkaline batteries and does not work with rechargeable ones.  The ad does not mention this.  I guess it needs the full 1.5 V and 1.2 is not enough.  Bummer.  As I hope to use this light a long time, I was hoping not to have to buy new batteries for it every six months.  Also, there are no adjustments for how long the light stays on or how sensitive the motion detector is.  Otherwise, it is fine.  LED's are bright ones and focus light well.

However, by that point it's too late and the album is basically over.Even on the few decent tracks, there is too much mentioning of how much money they have and all the nice cars they own. I'm not jealous, I just think that sh@t is played out and boring to hear about.  I'd rather hear street anthems along with some nice story telling tracks.But then again, WTF was I expecting from an 08' G-Unit album.Overall, a pretty crappy CD.  Stick to G-Unit's early-2000's mix tapes for some better material by them.I'll give the CD a generous 2 stars, because there are 2 or 3 decent songs on here, but you're better off downloading those tracks and putting them onto a mix of other songs.If you want to shake your booty, then by all means purchase the CD, but I'm not into that stuff, lol...."

1395019,B000U9TXJ0,A slick system... but watch for dead pixels!!,"I bought this package having no previous experience with PSP, having only owned Nintendo portable systems leading all the way back to the original ""grey brick"" Game Boy. Eventually, the allure of certain games such asMega Man Powered Upforced my hand, just as many excellent games for the PlayStation 2 led me to buy that system long after I already had a GameCube.This pack includes a game (Daxter), a 1 GB Memory Stick Duo, and 5 episodes of Family Guy (Family Guy - The Freakin Sweet Collection (UMD  Mini for PSP)) for only $30 more than a pack including only the system itself. It's an excellent deal. I haven't played too much of Daxter, but I played Jak and Daxter/Jak II/Jak 3 on PS2, and if the quality is just as high I expect it to be a great game as well. Keep in mind that the game, the UMD video, the memory stick, instructions, a battery and an AC adapter are the ONLY things in the box. Although this PSP model is capable of video out, you have to buy the cable separately:PSP 2000 Component AV Cable. Note also that, when the cable is used, it blows up UMD video to full screen but shows games at their native resolution, 480x272. This means they will be letterboxed on the top and bottom as well as the sides on nearly any screen. This system also has a USB cable output which is not proprietary, as it can be connected to a PC with any cable that has a male mini USB on one side and male standard USB on the other. The system is crippled when connected to a computer, however; you have to select a special option from the main menu to transfer files, after which the screen merely displays ""USB mode"" and cannot be used to do anything other than access the Memory Stick from a PC, similar to a USB flash drive.From what I've seen so far, the PSP is an excellent system for things other than games. If you don't have an iPod capable of displaying video, it handles video podcasts and other video in a variety of formats quite well. It also plays music, and you can fit a decent amount of it with the included memory stick. The internet browser is also capable, though it displays fast-paced video or flash, such as Homestar Runner, very slow and choppy.Gaming is the main focus of the PSP, and games look great. If you've played PlayStation 2, the PSP looks just as good. 3-D is rendered well, though from what I've experienced, slowdown is common when there are a lot of things on the screen at once. Also, the analog stick is terrible. It's not in a good place, and for someone with big hands like me, it causes thumb cramps. Supposedly you can buy a bigger stick to put on top of this one, and I may end up doing so. The other controls are top-notch, however. Loading is typically fast - perhaps faster on the Slim PSP, but I have no basis for comparison - though the CD spin-up noise is fairly loud.All that said, I come to my biggest gripe. I have bought three of these in a row, and ALL THREE OF THEM have had a dead pixel. Two displayed white on a dark screen, and one won't display red at all (it's black on a red screen, green on a white screen, but indistinguishable otherwise). I will be returning this one today to roll the dice for a fourth time. Sony claims that dead pixels are a common problem with all LCD screens, and you should play with the PSP for a week to make sure it really bothers you before you return it. This is BS! Sure, I'm getting irritated with all these returns, but they can't talk me into buying a damaged system.For those trying to decide between this and aNintendo DS Lite Onyx Black, I should note that Nintendo systems seem to be built to much higher standards. They rarely fail (I have accidentally dropped a Gamecube from 6 feet up onto a tile floor, and it wasn't even dented) and their customer service is top-notch. The same thing cannot be said for Sony systems - not only because of the dead pixels but in that numerous PlayStation 2 systems (including mine; I was forced to buy a new one despite having taken excellent care of it) have failed years before they should. The unique stylus input, dual-screen output, and vastly superior game library make the DS, in my opinion, a better system. That said, the DS cannot drive pixels quite as well as the PSP - 3D games look better on the PSP in general - and although Nintendo has produced several DS titles that are not technically games, such asBig Brain Academy, there's not much to the DS without a game inserted and the firmware offers only tiny bits of customization compared to the PSP's customizable colors, wallpapers, and themes. The DS can't play music, the Game Boy Advance Video titles can't compare to the quality of true UMD/DVD video, and although there is an internet browser available separately, it is vastly inferior to the one included in the PSP's firmware. If you don't want to mess with the unique playing style of the DS, and just want a PlayStation 2/music player/video player/internet browser for your back pocket, the PSP is the way to go."

3705280,B004QGYY9M,Drinkwell filtration for water bowls,"I am not too sure about this product.  From my initial reading of the description I expected something different, more like a fountain.  The need for this device is limited.  For the price you may just as well dump out the water and refill this dish.  While it seems to work just fine, the filters are small and have to be replace fairly often as most pet bowls are on the floor, close to dirt, hair etc.  I cannot say I would recommend this product."

3754624,B002BC4N5I,Review From A Professional Auto Detailer,"Griots has numerous products for which they really ought to be lauded and recommended.As a professional Auto Detailer (who has spent, and therefore blown, THOUSANDS of dollars testing products), I simply cannot do withoutGriot's Garage 11104 Interior Cleaner - 35 oz.,Griot's Garage 11040SP Leather Care Spray - 8 oz.; or (and especially!) theirGriot's Garage 11173SP Vinyl and Rubber Dressing - 8 oz., which is -- hands down -- the most superior product on the market for dressing and protecting one's interior vinyl, rubber and plastic components. (I have purposefully linked the smallest, lowest cost product offerings for you to test for yourself).That being said, Griot's Undercarriage Spray is... well, it's garbage, really. And ""garbage"" is not a word I use lightly as a pro detailer.1.) It will, in fact, re-color one's under-carriage and wheel wells... for about as long as it takes to drive through a hard rain and all the water left on the road from such a soaking.2.) It smells AWFUL of petrochemicals: DO NOT use this product in your garage or any sort of confined space: you WILL get the mother of all headaches.3.) Holy Moses, is this stuff EXPENSIVE for what it is and what it does: which is true of a lot of Griot's stuff. I need not say this to most people, but just in case: buy the PRODUCT, not the hype behind it. Further, trust the reviews of those that are probable to know better.The truth is this: ANY spray tire dressing will work as well (and likely better) as Griot's Under Carriage Spray for reconditioning one's wheel wells (which is what most people buy this product for).Here's a free tip: most tire dressings are silicone-based and are therefore very heavy. When squeezing the trigger, give your wrist a fairly quick flick in the direction you are spraying to minimize running of the product.AJBest-Auto-Detail.com"

1298560,B000J5Y214,Dead after less than a year,"Considering the price is so cheap on these, I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. To say that I used it ""rarely"" is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges. That said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up.Aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. However, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.Pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero."

418582,B004BKP4A6,No effect,"I have always had problems with gradual wax buildup. One time it got so bad that I ended up with swimmer's ear, getting a splitting headache and requiring a doctor's visit to remove wax. Every so often I try one of these wax removal products, hoping it will at least keep the buildup down. I've been looking for one that is safe, painless, and works. I've used store brands, syringes, name brands (Debrox, Murine, etc). This is my most recent attempt, and I'm still looking.I don't know if it's because the wax that forms in my ears is extra-hard or what, but the drops seem to have no effect whatsoever. The first time I applied them, I heard a fizzing noise and thought it might be working. However, upon rinsing... nothing came out. I repeated this for 4 days with no effect (this by the way, used up a good third of the bottle). Subsequent applications produced no noise at all, and I still saw no visible result. I know the wax is still there- it's plainly visible to the naked eye. I do notice, however, that water does enter my ear canal a lot more easily now- it's possible some excess wax was dissolved by this, but if so it was an insignificant amount.In the end, I ended up having it done the old-fashioned way- my wife just dug around in there and pulled some of it out. Not the most comfortable way to handle it, but it got the job done. It really didn't feel any easier to remove the wax this way than other times I've had it done, leaving me wondering whether the drops are anything but a placebo.I will say one thing about this package though: the earplugs and syringe do work and are useful for treatment or to wash out your ear canal. If the drops worked, I imagine this would be everything you'd need. Anyway, I still have some solution left so I do plan to use it up on the off-chance it just takes longer than the directions state (it says 4 days on the box). I'll update this if I get any meaningful results."

192250,B00J5DS8NE,Perfect for charging peripherals and international travel,"I love the compact size of he review sample that I received. Having five ports for charging the myriad of headsets, speakers and other peripherals I have laying around is a major convenience. In fact, this is perfect for those types of devices. If you are in a household or office with a few tablets and high-end phones this may not be as ideal. That is not an issue for me because the price to performance ratio still makes it a value, but I want to set expectations.Since this charger will operate on AC voltages ranging from 100 to 240 at 50 or 60 cycles you can use it internationally. Just replace the two prong figure-eight style cable with one that matches the outlets where you are visiting and it works.The specific limitation is this charger has a total of five amps output. That is clearly stated in the specs on this page, but is easy to overlook. What that means is the internal circuit is intelligent enough to level current as you plug more devices into it. for example, if you add up the ratings on each port you will see that they total 7.5 Amps. If you plug tablets drawing 2.1 Amps into ports 1 and 3 and a phone drawing one Amp into port 4 the two tablets will get only 2 Amps each. If you were to fill all of the ports, each device will only receive a Amp at five volts regardless of how the port is marked. This is not a problem. In fact, it's a safety feature because the device has the built in logic to ensure that it will not over charge a device.For someone like me who has a tablet and a high end phone this has value because I can charge both simultaneously at full speed and still manage to charge a headset. If I plug more devices into it, my phone and tablet will still charge at a respectable rate, while the other devices will also charge. For overnight charging this is an excellent solution.I am giving this five solid stars because the specs are clearly state the maximum output and this has protections against over heating and over charging. I love the small size and the fact that the AC cable can be replaced with any figure eight style when traveling internationally. Those are a lot of features for the modest price."

1811755,B009PMETZG,A Winner,"The following items were included in the shipping carton:Impact DriverBatteries (2)Battery ChargerBelt Clip w/attachment screwScrewdriver BitCloth Zippered Case w/handle for carryingUser ManualI have been phasing out lesser quality (IMHO) tools, such as Dewalt for example, and replacing them with Bosch. This is a welcome addition to my collection. I am installing gutter guards so this impact driver arrived at the optimum time. Since this gutter guard work involves a lot of ladder time I was curious to see how heavy the load would be if I used the belt clip. The impact driver weighs in at 2 lbs and 2 1/2 oz. The battery is an additional 11.6 oz. That totals up to the product description of 2.9 lbs. Not bad.The batteries have an indicator which shows the amount of charge. Both of them indicated a partial charge. To get to a full charge one of the batteries took 29 minutes and the other battery took 27 minutes. These are the new small but powerful Lithium-Ion 18V batteries. The battery charger displays a solid green light when it is plugged in without a battery installed. After inserting the battery the green light on the charger begins to blink. When the battery is fully charged the green light stops blinking and is solid. Very nice feature.One of the helpful features with Bosch is the provision of an actual user manual. It is a for real manual as opposed, for example, to many products with no documentation at all to the Dewalt choice of providing a single foldout sheet that is as big as a king size bed sheet and impossible to read. Bosch provides a manual that is easy to read, contains useful information and has clear illustrations.This Bosch impact driver has been a big help in assisting me with my gutter job and I am sure it will continue to perform as well on other projects just as my other Bosch tools have been doing.The impact driver and the batteries were made in Malaysia."

Max output is 15 amps @ 12 volts.Shop around. An orange logo home improvement place sells these for a good price.PROs:The CC2300 is perfect for tires.The built-in pressure gauge and clip-on inflation hose make tire inflation a breeze.You're going to waste money on gas unless maintaining your tire pressure is real fast and easy.

Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan."

1296703,B0002HLL8G,"Beautiful bridge pins, slightly small but should work with correct stringing","I put these on my ""campfire acoustic"" Black Yamaha F335 and they look stunning. The tone seems slightly brighter, however, I go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference I am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings. Since they are replacing plastic pins I am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective ""sounds good"".These pins are a little thin (small) so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing. If you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins. This may not be necessary, however, even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole. The string should go all the way through the hole, into the body of the guitar. Insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches, if possible it should be listing toward the neck. Then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly. Unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this. Then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin. Instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin. The pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own. Usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole. If you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you're trying to get your guitar in tune (typically ruining a brand new string in the process). If you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body (correctly) or hanging on the pin (incorrectly). Also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation.These fit my guitar snugly but not tightly, however I do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that I do a lot of string bending a whole step or more (sometimes using two fingers' strength to bend that far). Overall I am quite pleased with these."

61501,B005TDWT4I,Much nicer than it looks- quality materials and fits exceptionally well!,"I've learned there are a few things that I have to have in an IPOD Touch case: solid nice weight material (not polycarbonate), a case that goes over onto the touch screen just a bit to help protect it, some level of style and panache to the design and color, and a feel that is comfortable to grasp, hold, and carry. I use my IPOD Touch primarily at the gym and for casual trips on planes and trains. My level of protection need is medium - I like to have a little extra assurance but I am careful with my electronics (at least at the IPOD price point!)This case arrived and the color is brilliant purple in a good way and the picture very much represents the product color. Though it looks, in the picture, like there is a wider separation on the back between what look like blinds in reality it is not that much but it does create a very unique and engaging look.It fits very well with no problems. All appropriate things are covered and I didn't have any problem with any buttons and such. It's comfy to hold and carry-providing good gripping power so the IPOD is less likely to slip through hands (particularly while working out). The material is thick enough to provide some peace of mind but not bulky enough to bring to mind a Nerf style protector. Overall I am very pleased with this. The only issue I've had with Belkin cases (the silicone or rubberized feeling ones) is discoloration from carrying it from sweat and such on my hands so I will update this review if that becomes an issue."

It was what I imagine chalk might be like in both taste and texture if eaten.But these are for kids, that the texture might not bother them. So, I did test them out on my one year old.

357273,B002CE3518,I love these blades.,"I had been using razors from my local drug store which were not great (generic drug store brand) and Wilkinson Sword. The Wilkinson Sword Blades were not bad, but are only available in my local store in 5 packs, were often out of stock, and are a bit expensive for what is supposed to be a cheaper alternative to cartridge razors. A friend recommended buying a sampler pack from Amazon so I gave that a try last year (120 blades assorted brands for about $22). There were some junk razors, some okay razors, and some very good razors, however these Crystal Super+ were my favorite. Very sharp, very smooth, with no irritation at all. I was very glad when it came time to re-order and found that Amazon carries this brand in a package of 120 for less than I paid for the sample pack. This is a great deal (more than $50 less than buying razors from my local drugstore) and the quality of the razors are superb. I have noticed that people's taste in razors is definitely subjective, but for my money I will be using Crystal Super+ as long as they are available on here on Amazon."

1308110,B00001ZWNA,Much better on the PC,"In Rainbow Six, you assemble a highly skilled team of anti terrorist commandos, plan out your assault and then control one or more of the team as you commence your invasion.The critical item to note here is that the majority of the game is spent choosing your team, equiping them properly and then planning out the raid.  This is not Syphon Filter where you jump into a room of bad guys and blaze away.  You can be killed in a single shot.  Once the action begins, you can play any one of the raid team that is engaging the enemy, otherwise the sophisticated computer AI will guide them according to your plans.I agree with the reviews that suggest that you rent this game first.  It is very detailed and realistic.  If you don't want to spend hours analyzing and preparing the missions, then you wont't appreciate the game's considerable depth.I find that the detail level does not lend itself well to the standard dreamcast controller.  There are too many things to do and the interface layout is awkward without a keyboard and mouse.  I also found that the action part of the game (moving the aiming cursor) was overly sensitive and very frustrating to use.The other reason that this game does not rate highly for me was the poor, boxey graphics and the medicore sound.  They just do not take advantage of the Dreamcast capabilities.  On the otherhand, the game does have a lot of replay value and very sophisticated AI."

Not your typical Oreo, but a good idea!The entire thing is thinner than the original Oreo cookie and a little chocolatier. My little sister is an Oreo fanatic and I am the type of person who likes the Oreo flavor, but not the cookies by themselves. We both agreed that these cookies were a good addition to the Oreo family. I personally thought that the peanut flavor was a little bit strong, but I tend to prefer a weaker peanut flavor.I really like the design for these cookies and am looking forward to trying the Mint version!"

My assistant holds the cat and tries to cover his eyes while I grind down the death talons one by one. The wireless design is awesome. My husband has also taken to using them to trim his toenails.

1506012,B007RNWUC4,You will not regret buying this game,"I have to begin with some information about the release of this game. This game was originally released in Japan on June 10th, 2010. It took a lot of effort to finally get this game released in the USA. Credit goes to a few sources such as Operation Rainfall to help rally support, Gamestop for help funding the release (more on that later), and Nintendo of America for finally publishing this game for North America. I purchased this from Gamestop as it was the only retailer selling this game besides purchasing directly from Nintendo. The manager informed me that Gamestop made a deal with Nintendo to purchase all the copies of this game, essentially funding the North American localization and giving Gamestop exclusive rights to sell the game. Long story short, yes you have to purchase from Gamestop but that shouldn't stop anyone as it will help support these types of games for future releases in the USA. I would recommend playing this game with the Classic Controller or Classic Pro. The Wii remotes and Nunchuk aren't really complicated but it is much easier to move around and attack during combat with the other controllers and you don't have to hold two controllers.This game is a JRPG (Japanese Roll-Playing game) from director Tetsuya Takahashi (worked on a lot of the Final Fantasy games, Chrono Trigger, and Xenogears Saga). The story is amazing and will keep you hooked. The gameplay is addictive. There is a reason why game informer magazine gave this game a 9.5 out of 10, metacrtic a 92% and several other reviewers gave it a 9 out of 10 or a 10 out of 10. When you play it, you will see why.Battle System: Uses a real-time battle system with positioning. Similar to Dragon Age and Knights of the Old Republic, you select enemies (the main enemy is robots called Mechons or you can attack local wildlife), and choose to attack them. Some enemies will attack you on sight or sound. You can sneak up on most enemies and do a back attack for major damage. What is similar to Dragon Age and Knights of the Old Republic is that when you choose to attack, your party automatically attacks. The difference from those games is that the player you are controlling, you have to move them into position for them to auto-attack. Everybody has special attacks called arts and talent arts. These are spell-like abilities such as healing, shielding, defense, etc. and special attacks that can knock enemies down. Each art has a recharge period before you can use it again and talent arts recharge by using enough regular attacks. Some special art attacks will depend on positioning of the enemy, such as back attack you need to be behind the enemy or a side attack you need to be on one of the enemy's sides to deal the maximum damage. Other aspects of battle include combo attacks and the ability of your main weapon (the Xenoblade) to see future enemy attacks that will essentially knock out a party member. This ability gives you a chance to stop it from happening by warning that party member or doing something else to prevent it. The battle system is somewhat complex but very manageable with tutorials and they don't throw all aspects at you from the beginning. You can lock-on to enemies before actually attacking them and see what level they are at and if they will attack on site, sound, or just leave you alone. Obviously if you see an enemy or animal at level 75 when you are at level 20 you will know not to mess with them, but keep your distance as they may attack on sight and wipe you out fast.Inventory/Leveling up: Inventory is massive and found all over the place and obtained in treasure chests from defeated enemies. You can see if each item will help raise or lower the stats of each player. Some clothing items have slots on them where you can add ability gems or some come with ability gems already attached to them. More about this in the next section. You can buy and sell inventory. Leveling up is done automatically when you gain a level. Each combat art must be manually leveled up. From each battle, you gain points to use for leveling up these abilities.Gems: This is somewhat complicated to explain. There are multiple types of gems you can create including gems for increasing stats, attacks, defense, etc. You have to craft these gems from the raw materials you gather. Each material has one or multiple stat enhancements attached to them. These stats are measured in a percentage. When crafting gems, you have to choose a combination of materials that will take one of those stats to 100% or higher in order to create a gem. If there are multiple stat enhancements that don't reach 100% during crafting, you will be able to save 1 or more of them in pure form and reuse them. Materials also have different levels so you can craft higher level gems as you progress. All of this might sound confusing and granted I am still experimenting with this, but it is easier to do than to explain and the tutorials do a great job of explaining this.World Map/Exploration: Each area you explore has a map. Different points you come across in each area will have an auto transport icon that lets you warp to that location. If you want to go back to Colony 9 (where the game starts), you can just warp and then warp back to where you were). Exploration is very open and the area to explore is huge. The director described the area as the size of the Japanese Archipelago (basically the size of Japan itself) but the game moves along nicely. Each new area you reach on the map will also net you some experience points so exploring is beneficial to leveling up. There is day and night time during the game and enemies are different during the day and night. You can change the time of day at any time which is a nice feature and you can save anywhere (except during battles).Missions/Side Quests: The main story missions are easy to find and follow. A lot of times you get an arrow pointing the direction and distance you need to go. Side quests are plenty in this game. Most of them are not complicated just collecting certain items or defeating certain creatures. When you collect an item that is used for a future side quest or mission, the Manado tells you and marks that item for you so you know not to sell it. Side quests net you experience and money.Conclusion: This game is simply amazing. This is the first game I have ever reviewed before I actually complete it. I am about 20 hours in and loving every minute of this. I want to get the word out to pick this up and support this game. If you are a fan of JRPGs (and who isn't), get this game. If you are new to JRPGs, get this game. I believe this game will have aspects that every gamer will enjoy. Story, battle, exploration, crafting, character development, etc. This game has it all. Can't wait to finish it. If this game sounds complex, just remember that there are tutorials along the way and you can review them at any time during the game. I will update this review with any other details that I come across that could help other gamers make their decision to purchase. If you have questions, feel free to ask and I will try and answer them quickly. I give this game a 10 out of 10 and I don't see that changing as I progress in the game. This is the best graphics I have seen on the Wii and although it is not HD, I'm just glad I get to play this game and I thank all the efforts that went into getting Nintendo to release this in North America."
1298979,B000OY707S,Absolute Junk,"I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp.  The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy.  However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate.  This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch.  The worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out.  The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made.  For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that Boss would put out a better product.  I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site."

But he wised up, and so did I: the Duck & Pea formula is ghastly.  The smell is so bad and lingered on my fingers (blech!) so I started using a hospital glove to make it into a ball after I stick the capsule in.  I'm changing my selection to another flavor."

1415904,B001COV1CY,really really new stuff and pont of view for a FPS,"I've been hearing about dissapointment for this game, somehow i kind of understand, because maybe they where expecting something like CODMW2, which by the way is a really good game. This one is something apart, different, its not about just shooting a reflexes, its aobut strategy, it remembers me Age of empires or command and conquer the first ones, because you cannot rely on yourself, its more about teamwork. Its like a sand box, where you can build an awesome game or a crapy one depending on yourlself only. Not the game, is like actually war, yo can take your chances by yourself or a team, to whom yo can relate in many different ways. Like a Little Big planet or Mod nation Racers but about war, and not about building something fisical, but builiding you own experience. I'll give it a 5.5/5, if i could. For the actually freedom the have delivered. Though.... Uncharted 2 is more my kind of game, and Gran Turismo 5 in comming months.... Great year"

1306881,B00000K4MC,How fun!,"In this game, you can build your own dream park with lots of rollar coaster, shops, merry-go-round, beautiful games, etc. You can design your own rollar coaster with any colour and can design your own park. Except this, you can also kill people in your park. You can build a non-finish rollar coaster and then start it, when the rollar-coaster-car reach there, it will throw away and 'BOMB', all the people in the car will die immediately! But this is a healthy game for children and kill people will diminish your park's rating so I don't think you should do that."
1294845,B0002D0PB4,"I had been using 1.5 mm picks, but needed teardrop picks, for shredding","Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones, so I used them as templates, to cut these down. I would have rated them higher, if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks, but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks, 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper."

1661523,B007FK3CVM,Better Aloe Drink,"This natural aloe water is made in California from aloe harvested in North America.  It is 15.2 ounces and 35 calories.  They suggest it provide two servings but I drank the entire drink down quickly.  The first thing I noticed was that it faintly reminded me of the taste of tequila.  Maybe that was just wishful thinking but it had a pleasant taste and no chunks, strands, or slime that I'm used to in most aloe drinks.  It wasn't sweet but it does contain organic cane sugar and stevia.  Yet, it only has 4 grams of sugar in it so it isn't sugar heavy.  I think it is so smooth tasting because it is made from the organic inner leaf aloe vera powder.  I definitely prefer it to the heavy, slimy aloe vera drinks that I've been drinking for the health benefits."

264603,B000N4G8IQ,I can't imagine wearing these at work or anywhere,"Let's see.  Gloves...sure, let's get some scissors out and cut the fingertips off.  Oops, the edges are raw, so we better overstitch them so they don't unravel.  Wait, these are too small to wear for rough work, not to mention, too thin to wear to keep my hands warm during the winter, when I need to do something with my fingertips for precision.  I know!  Let's market them for arthritis use.That was my guess as to how these gloves came about, fictional?  Maybe.  In any case, good luck getting these off properly so they don't rumple inside out when you're making a mad rush to the bathroom.  If yours fit loose, is that going to do you any good? Maybe not.  If tight, you'll still be wrestling these off.They look cheaply made too.  I would rather wear something like isotoner gloves, more fashionable and better colors.  Charcoal is O.K., but they used black thread at the fingertips.  Were they too frugal to buy some matching thread?  Also, since the fingers (on the gloves) don't do much for me, why are they so long?  A little shorter and then they may not interfere with my keyboard clicks.  PASS.They do look pretty much like the picture, like everything, they could stand to make an in between size.  There always seems to be a gap.  I was on the extreme outside of the measurement that I bought, but I think that the larger size would have been too large. Yep, they do seem a tad stretched.  Live and learn.  Not worth what I paid for them."
3564190,B00GD9GNEY,"Epic fail DC...again, Yes I've actually watched it.",Epic fail DC...again. The plot was rather cliche' and rather dry. This is supposed to be when the heroes meet for the first time. I assume this is their way of introducing the &#34;New 52&#34;. The voice casting was awful to be blunt. I kept expecting Batman to pull out a cigar and say &#34;see&#34; after every sentence. Wonder Woman sounds and acts like Xena warrior princess. The outfits are fine except Wonder Woman's. I honestly could have liked it if weren't for the long gloves that look too gaudy. Plus the chest design is way too small. I think she would have looked better if they had made it into more of a body suit. It is not the &#34;New 52&#34; design which I like better. (Actually I like her original &#34;New 52&#34; design where the outfit is basically the same but in silver and with pants.) I not sure who decided Wonder Woman should act like...a man. Basically all the characters are vastly different than the ones we are used to. Superman is very arrogant and unlikable. They spend most of their time posturing and strutting around &#34;waving their swords&#34;. This is the worst Justice League movie ever. VERY glad I just rented it.

1827453,B000001IU1,So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes,"So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes~ NOFX is a not an awfull album but it is just not very interesting and sounds like any other punk album. Simply chords, lyrics that are laced with curse words and seem to be talking about absolutely nothing in particular and sounds like kids playing around with politics but they have no real idea what they are talking about so the end result is that it just sounds trite and forced. Someone should have taught these guys to write decent lyrics instead of these trite and boring schlock that they produce. Knowing how to sing also helps and being able to play your instrument also helps. This album is so boring..but it is not awfull enough to get one star."

I say this because you can't say anything bad about this pedal. It sounds amazing. It just might not be your sound. I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9. People who say this is better than the TS9 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording. They prefer it. It's not better. Both are great."

1839213,B000002MTI,Awesome,If you're a fan of thier earlier work you'd have to be the most boring idiot in the world to find this album short of great. If you are new to Faith No More expect nothing but great songs and dont go in thinking you will hear one kind of music. Faith No More have always changed thier sound and to assume for one second this album is lacking takes a really screwed up ear. Faith No More was never anyones band but thier own to do with as they please. The most nonconventional band that ever was next to any else of Mike Pattons off the rocker projects(if you like Faith No More try Tomahawk and Mr. Bungle(Mike Patton is lead vocals of both bands).Its almost disturbing that errogant music puritans have so much to say about a band that had so much damn fun. You think they'd listen to music to loosten rather then tighten up.

I was doing really good but then I had to face this cave troll, unfortunatly it had alot of armor so it was hard to kill. So then I died and I went all the way back to my last checkpoint, and quess what, I got that chectpoint about one hour before I died so it was like that entire hour never happened. So I sugest you never get this game. Of course you can use the game for nice firewood. Yeah thats it the game will make exillent firewood. If you want a good game I sugest Metal Arms, Halo, Halo 2 (when it comes out), or PGR2 (Project Gothem Racing 2).  Any of those games are fine, but don't get The Return of the King video game unless you want good firewood."
2942714,B000NDJGTK,Break up with this movie; fast!,"When a film stars a slew of respectable actors and or comedians and or celebrities you kind of hope and pray that the film is going to be good; right?  You hear the name Jason Bateman and you think of that subtle humor that coats his serious tone and you get kind of excited about what he'll do with his role.  You hear the name Amanda Peet and you recall her scene stealing work in `The Whole Nine Yards' and dream of her capitalizing on that shining moment of brilliance.  You hear the name Mia Farrow and you think `OMG, ACTRESS' because she is, like, the definition of one.  You hear the name Zach Braff and you think of `Scrubs' and the fact that he carries that show on his shoulders with his spin on the whole `man-child' theatrics.  You hear the name Amy Poehler and you think of her hilarious SNL skits, or Amy Adams and her dynamic knack for creating layered comedic characters.  In less rambling terms; you see all those names on the front of this DVD and you expect a sleeper hit.If you expected that then you would be DEAD wrong.The film is barely funny (I thought MAYBE one or two scenes were funny) and in the end it is insultingly predictable and somewhat (ok, a lot what) preposterous.  It was like the filmmakers (screenwriter, whatever) got stumped by his own formula and decided to just throw every possible logistics he attempted to create out the window.  I mean, the whole character that is Chip is a complete waste of time and energy, and that character was handed to Jason Bateman!!!WHY?!?!?!?!Yuck; this movie is so incredibly stupid I want to beat my face against a wall for wasting the time reviewing it (not really, but almost).Anyways, I don't even know if it's worth the time, but I'm bored so get a whiff of the plot.  You have Tom and Sophia who are married and in love and have a baby.  Tom can't hold a job, and Sophia (who has a successful legal career) has decided to put her career on hold to raise their new baby.  Tom, recently jobless, accepts an offer to work at an add agency with Sophia's father.  The agency is weird and eccentric (unbelievably so) and so obviously Tom is out of place.  Then Tom meets Chip, a wheelchair bound middle aged jerk who once slept with Sophia and (creepily) makes his affections known for her every way he can.  Surprisingly (or should I say, clich&eacute;d-like) no one by Tom even notices all the blatantly obvious ways with which Chip proves himself a total creep.Of course, the whole world loves Chip, Tom comes inches from losing his wife, and then instantaneously the world realizes Chip is not what he says he is, he gives up his charade without even a fight and Tom is the world's biggest hero.This movie is retarded."
2723412,B0002J58NI,Definitely for beginners...No muscle afterburn... :-(,"I guess I should have noticed the title of this video...Target Toning for BEGINNERS.I was looking for a toning video that targeted different parts of the body in short, 10-minute segments; thus I discovered the 10 Minute Solutions series. This video is geared EXCLUSIVELY towards beginners. I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser, and this video didn't make me break a sweat.The only thing good about this video is that the exercises themselves are quite unique. You won't likely find these same routines on other videos. If you are looking to mix up yor routine, this video may assist you in that venture.I did not like the instructor. Her dialogue seemed so scripted and fake. She was overly peppy and, in my opinion, extrememly annoying."
1815782,B00C1CF1S6,"Maybe Hold Off Until the ""Bugs"" Have Been Resolved ...","I see that there are already a number of reviews that reveal the ""bugginess"" of this system. I can confirm the validity of these reports. To piggyback on the words of others, here is my experience:Pros:-Easy to install. (Seriously, do not let it intimidate you, I promise that even your grandmother could do it). We were able to accomplish the installation in about fifteen minutes.-Inexpensive.Cons:-Not what I would expect from Chamberlain. It is clunky and looks like a throw-back from the 1980s. I would expect something slightly more sophisticated in appearance.-Buggy. (I uninstalled it in less than two days after being wildly frustrated with the ""bugginess"" of this product). I simply cannot instill my faith in this system (especially when it involves the security of my home!!)Put this in your cart and then keep checking these reviews. When the reviews state that Chamberlain has resolved these issues, then I would consider buying it (wait for multiple reviews to confirm this)."

490328,B0096J28Z6,Problems with Sensa,"I've seen a million commercials for Sensa and always been a little curious.  I have read, however, that when the commercials promise a ""free trial,"" what you will actually encounter is automatic enrollment into a monthly plan that they make it impossible to get out of.  So I was happy to take Vine up on an offer of an actually free trial month.Initial reaction: even though I could detect a taste difference, it wasn't very strong or negative. It's easy to remember to use and the packaging is fairly attractive.I didn't notice any appetite difference, and I'm definitely not the type to sign up and pay for another month on the bet that it kicks in.Most significantly, though - two nights in a row about a half an hour after using Sensa on my dinner I experienced really severe and long-lasting muscle cramps in one of my feet.  Since I've never had a problem with muscle pain before and it happened two nights at the same time where the Sensa was that only thing I consumed both times, for the moment at least I have to imagine it's the culprit.  Don't a bit of reading online it seems like even though foot cramps aren't the most common side effects of Sensa, it is something other people have experienced as well.  I'm not willing to keep sprinkling for further evidence."

1299461,B000VBH2IG,Poor quality recorder,"I purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price. After trying to use it I promptly returned it. I do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows.  I have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer.  I tried recording on the H2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my Mackie sound board or my stereo receiver.  No matter how I set the levels the recording on the H2 was very distorted.  I played with the record levels and the AGC and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal.  I have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound.  The problem with my H2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp. Recording from the internal mics seems to work fine.  I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the Zoom recorders are the only brand where I have found this problem.The H2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else.  I exchanged this model for an H4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the H2.  I finally ended up getting the Tascam DR-07 which I am very happy with.  It has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder."
528337,B00GLO7M00,Like it,"Pros--the rotating lights are cool.  I can pick just one or have no light if I want.  The mist comes out as soon as I turn it on and the essential oil smell fills my office nicely.  It's a conversation starter because of how it looks.  Many people thinks it has smoke coming out of it!  It shuts off when the water runs out.Cons--It does not last 8 hrs like the package says it will.  This is why I gave 3 stars instead of 4. It lasts about 3 hrs every time I've used it, which is twice a day (6 hrs total) for the last week.  Also it says to use tap water and not purified or distilled water which I don't really like.  I've been able to use my purified tap water though and it's been working.  One time I didn't have my tap water so I used Evian bottled water.  It kept shutting off after only a few minutes.  So I emptied it out and went to get regular tap water down the hall (this is at work).  Then it worked with no problem.  So apparently the type of water does make a difference."

1294143,B0002CZV82,Wish I knew then what I know now...,"From Greg Abrams review, entitled ""For all but the tone snobs,"" a review further down on this product's page:""Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat ""basic"") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal.""I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a ""big amp"" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU."

The only perk that's worth upgrading is hacker pro.  And the programming of the game is awful.  Yesterday I played demolition.  Well some kids from Canada would camp at the spawn points and kill people as they spawned in.  In fact one guy would knife people in the back as they spawned in one foot away from him.  The shotguns in the game are worthless.  Explosive rockets aren't as deadly.  And overall graphics for the game are a real stepdown from MW2.  And so are the maps.  While this COD did away with ""no scoping"", no one really snipes anymore because you can't replenish claymores and very few maps which have good sniping points.  The care packages are a joke.MW2 was a far superior game, but they did nothing to stop hackers.  I won't be buying anymore COD games.  I will be returning the Black Ops game I bought for a friend.Update:Well the game is flooded with hackers.  You can't compete unless you cheat.  Activision doesn't care.

I doubt most people would care, but it's annoying to me that my keys wouldn't rotate around freely on a metal ring.If you don't care about that, it's an interesting and sturdy product.  If you do, then just do what I do and use a staple remover to hold a regular key ring open."

3030603,B0013XZ6NO,What the hell did I just watch?,I love western movies. But this.....forget it. I don't understand how Val Kilmer got involved in this movie. It made no sense at all. It was stupid and rediculous. Some of the actors were hard to understand. Val Kilmer's charactor was easier to understand; and he was DEAD! I would never compare this movie to any of Clint Eastwood's westerns. MONEY WASTED!!

I don't regret renting it but for anyone who hasn't seen it, don't be prepared to be blown away."

I have been using that product for going on 4 years now and have not had one instance of revisiting any oops.
373677,B002UKOTZK,"good product, I recommend","My husband loves this little machine! My mom gave it to me, though I don't need any help sleeping - I could sleep through a hurricane, it has been said - and my husband has been using it for more than two years. His favorite sound is the thunderstorm setting, and though it's on a pretty short loop, it helps him to get to sleep quickly and easily. I was glad that he could use it, because I just left it in the box until after me and my husband started dating. When I found out he was having trouble sleeping in the city where he lived, because the street he lived on had a lot of bars and drunken people screaming at each other all hours of the night, I suggested he try this little conundrum, and it just so happened to be the answer to his problem. Now he falls asleep to it nearly every night, since it helps him relax and fall asleep pretty quickly. If he hasn't fallen asleep by the time it goes off, all he has to do is reach over and push the power button again, and he has never done that more than once in a night as far as I know. The one we have is more than three years old and still works fine, except the power button never goes off any more, which is no big deal. I highly recommend this simple machine for anyone who has trouble sleeping due to sound disturbances (though my husband has moved now and no longer needs it to cover up the drunks), but I wouldn't suggest you pay any more than $15 for it. I know when the one we have goes bad, we're going to get another."

3621684,B000BL0BJI,It's HUGE and high quality,"I bought this Activity kit, the Lookout kit and 7 packages of assorted tubes to build a fun maze in my 55 gallon aquarium for my hamster. I built the tunnel free standing, relying on the aquarium glass to provide support and stability.When I took this activity kit out of the box, i was surprised by how HUGE everything is, especially, the wheel and the circular part at the top. Although I didn't measure it, it is estimated to be about 6&#34; in diameter for the circular tunnel and the wheel. HUGE. The lookout is a decent size where I can put treats in it for my hamster and still has room for her to hang out in.The parts are made with thick plastics and the connector rings are pretty easy to work with. One thing that I don't like is that the parts are somewhat lose when connected together. The tunnel can turn and slide downward when putting heavier parts on. Keep in mind that working with gravity can be challenging. As long as you are building the tunnel with gravity in mind, it should be fine. I rely on other parts of the tunnel to provide support to the lookout. Since it is in a glass aquarium, I can use velcro to secure the tunnel onto the glass, if needed. Not sure if this will work well for a cage without exterior support, like I do with the aquarium glass. The parts also have a good weight.I highly recommend this product. It is very high quality. With multiple packages of these assorted tubes and the space you are working with, it allows you to be creative. Keep in mind, gravity is not a friend when it comes to building tunnels with these parts."
3404316,B006OFN0BQ,J. Edgar Hoover changed the FBI,"Rated ""R"". Running Time: 2 hours, 16 min.The adult life of J. Edgar Hoover is dramatized in this movie as we see him as the Appointed Director of the Bureau of Investigation. The movie jumps around through his life from 1919 to 1972. In 1921, he became the Deputy head of the Bureau of Investigation.  He had no wife, no girlfriend, practically no social life, and so, the Attorney General promoted him to Appointed Director in 1924.  J. Edgar became obsessed with wanting to solve crimes, including the disappearance of the Charles Lindbergh baby case. He believed that ""information was power"" and used wire-tapping. The organization he created was the introduction of fingerprint files, crime labs and agents. He also kept personal and confidential files on several people and anyone that was after him, he wanted them investigated and a file started on them. He wanted agents to photograph them.J. Edgar kept his personal life very private. This movie depicts his speculated personal life as having a relationship with Clyde Tolson, his FBI Associate Director for nearly 40 years. Whatever went on behind closed doors of their homes will never be known, however in the end, Hoover left his entire estate to Tolson.Leonardo Dicaprio as ""J. Edgar Hoover"", Gunner Wright as ""Dwight Eisenhower"", David A. Cooper as ""Franklin Roosevelt"", Jeffrey Donovan as ""Robert Kennedy"", Josh Lucas as ""Charles Lindbergh"", Emily Alynlind as ""Shirley Temple"", Jamie LaBarber as ""Ginger Rogers"", Christopher Shyer as ""Richard Nixon"".Also in the cast: Naomi Watts, Judi Dench, Ken Howard.Option of Language: English, French.Option of Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.I did not care for the color processing of this movie. My television made it look awful.Note: J. Edgar Hoover served under eight Presidents of the United States from 1924-1972, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover (no relation), Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon.  He had power that no other FBI head will ever have.He probably would have loved the Internet which didn't gain speed until 1995, 100 years after his birth.Other movies:The Private Files Of J. Edgar Hoover (MGM Limited Edition Collection)(1977). Starring Broderick Crawford.J. Edgar Hoover (1987-tvm). Starring Treat Williams.Hoover(2000) Starring Ernest Borgnine."
2072750,1572522232,A Horror Masterpiece...,"...  This is an excellent movie, full of atmosphere, mystery, and suspense. It is not, admittedly, for those who don't like a slower pace, and is not a cheap-shock-a-minute gore fest like alot of horror films, but thoughtful and artistic. The color saturation is beautiful, and the screen is drenched in greens and reds, making the viewer feel quite uncomfortable (it grabs you so much that, later in the film, when the main character actually leaves the primary setting, the outside world doesn't quite seem right). The music is insane; one of the best ever. Goblin has never been better. And there is blood and gore and frights. This is my favorite movie ever, so don't listen to a few negative reviews by people who don't get it ... - check it out for yourself. It won't be a waste of time."
3754837,B002E2WMWG,"Looks good and decently priced, questionable quality","Originally I was satisfied with this purchase because they were decently priced and bright, but already after a short 3 weeks; one of the bulbs has burnt out.  When I installed them I wore gloves and was still careful not to touch the bulbs as best as I could so I don't think it was caused by an error during installation.  Maybe I just received a faulty bulb, but either way I will not be ordering from this brand again and I wouldn't recommend this product."

Many of the other reviews have gone into detail in regards to what is wrong with this game.  I am adding this review because somehow enough people liked this game to make it 2.5 stars.  THIS IS NOT a 2.5 star game.  THIS IS NOT a one star game.  It's games like this that make me wish I could give products NO STARS.To make it clear how bad this game is - IF everything worked as the developers intended, this would STILL be a one star game.  It's boring and beyond stupid. This game is so bad it's beyond being so bad it's funny.  I really can't think of anything positive to say about this game.Congrats to Deep Silver for making the worst game of the year.Wait!  I found a good use for this game!  Give it to someone you hate.  They will return the feeling in spades after receiving this as a gift."
1838055,B000002LBV,"""Just Thanking The Lord For My Fingers""","Sometimes separation can be a blessing, and Paul's debut solo album seals this fact. He abandons his overrefined folk leanings and employs much more assertive and primitive textures even with material that's in the realm of folk. Most notably, it's in the music itself that his artistic reinvention is unveiled with his cultivation of diverse shades of World Music - reggae (""Mother and Child Reunion""), Peruvian (""Duncan"") and calypso (""Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard""). And whew, these are the three chosen singles!This record is one of the most autonomous and bravest moves in mainstream rock and there's nothing that veers towards a wasted track. Blues is also a new source of his inspiration. He has a less-detached perspective concerning his own private horrors. He becomes unstrung on ""Paranoia Blues"". But ultimately this album deals with the choices of acceptance and survival in mostly inevitable afflictions - physical malaise, bad dreams, lost youth, divorce and a death. He ensures that his emotional state of mind will carry him through all this somehow.The three most powerful cuts (in addition to the singles) are ""Peace Like A River"", ""Congratulations"" and ""Run That Body Down"". Man does he know how to project his voice, even through the electricity. His acoustic guitar playing is both tasteful and rockin'. On top of that, he distills a language down to a clarity of substantive truths with a sharp wit underneath. Lord knows how long it took for him to live these songs. A rare gem that not only holds its own, it deepens over time."

And my husband started a saying then ""an opened bag of these chips is and empty bag of these chips""  and once we came home we could not find them anywhere. No store around our town of Grand Junction Colorado carried the baked cheddar chips. So I looked to Amazon and there they were. So now we have them available and we will order more. Yesterday we had sandwiches for lunch and as my husband ate the last few chips and crumpled the bag up he said"" an opened bag of chips is an empty bag and he laughed. They really are good tasting chips whether a person is watching their calorie intake or not. We will buy them again!"
1752764,B00168VZ86,"Works great, for maybe a year.","This product works great out of the box, but there is something wrong with either the battery or the internal charger, and the battery dies inside a year, even if lightly used. A SLA battery should last at least 3 years.The Coleman website reviews for this product show this to be a consistent pattern.It is _possible_, of course, that the units being sold _now_ are better than the one I got in December of 2011, but given that Coleman doesn't state the length of the warranty up front, I suggest giving this product a pass until Coleman gets their quality control figured out."
1326606,B00005Q5CW,"A reviewer from a non-skier, non-boarder","HiI don't ski, don't snowboard, and I've never played games of this genre before. I recently got interested in SSX3 from seeing a review about it online; so I tried out a friend's demo disk to see if it was something I'd like. It was actually quite fun.So then I decided to look around to see what other snowboarding games are out there besides SSX.I went thru all the reviews on the web comparing SSX, Amped, Dark Summit, Transworld, etc... and eventually.... settled on Amped.It has been reported that Amped is too difficult. Since I have only played SSX3 for about 15 minutes, I can tell you that the folks who say Amped is too difficult are very likely those who have played the SSX series extensively and are used to the simplicity with which one can do outrageous stunts. Since I've never really played those games I don't have that bias.So is it too difficult? No. It is no more difficult than any racing game where you will spend some time learning all the controls.In comparing my brief exposure to SSX3 and Amped here's my summary:- SSX3 has too short a draw distance. I found myself  trying to look up and off the screen to see where I was going. Amped has very very long draw distance making it very easy to see where you are going.- SSX3's physics is significantly exaggerated over Amped. You can land sideways on your board and keep going- I'm no snowboarder but I know from common sense that if you tried that in real life you will wipe out!- SSX3's snow effects are inferior to Amped. SSX3 carves out simple trenches where you snowboard travels. Amped creates beautiful texture mapped trenches with dust trails.- The overall degree of realism in Amped is far greater than SSX3's. The outdoor scenary in Amped is wonderful. I found SSX's scenary extremely artificial.- There are no time limits in Amped like SSX. I hate racing games with time limits. There is never ever enough time.- Amped's track is quite large and the game allows you to explore unintended paths at any time. SSX3 now provides the same thing but at specific branch points only.- I found the radio in SSX3 incredibly juvenile. There was some chatter about somebody in high school- I found myself wanting to switch the radio off. That pretty much told me who the game's targeted age group is."
3747824,B000E8P77O,Filtrate too dense?,"Some months ago there was a review here where a Tacoma 2.7L owner talked about Purolator filters being too restrictive causing excessive valve noise and possibly contributing to the early demise of his engine. I don't know where that review went but having used Wix or Purolator filters exclusively on my 2008 Tacoma I have noticed occasions where it was exceptionally valvey sounding though I did not equate it with a particular oil filter being on it. On my last oil change I replaced the Purolator that was on there with a Toyota filter, and used the same weight Mobil 1 oil that I always use, and the valve noise went away! I realize now that our old Corolla went through periods where I thought the valve noise was excessive too and it was probably when I had a Purolator on it. I hate to say this about Purolators, because I have always considered them to be fantastic filters, but maybe they don't play well with Toyotas. I am going to stick with Toyota filters from now on.Edit: I finally found the other review I had seen and it was posted to the Purolator PL14476 (which is the Corolla filter) instead of this one as I had thought. Now there are 2 reviews there talking about the same issue."
1354295,B0002MPT6Q,"For a RTS playing oldtimer, this game rocks!!!","I know a lot of people (kids) are comparing this game to MTW or Shogun. I have never played those games at all. Why? Well, I've been on a FPS kick for the last couple years playing such games as Far Cry, M of H, Call of Duty you name it! But I have played many RTS games including the Age of Empires 1, 2, 3, Empire Earth, Empires: Dawn of Modern Warfare, Rise of Nations, Home World 2, Orb, American Conquest/Fight Back, etc.... the list goes on and on but here's my point!I have never played a RTS game with such depth and top-notch graphics to boot that captures your imagination and takes all of reality and time like this game does to me!!! The main reason is there is soooooo much you can do with this game. You can fight every battle you want (battle map) or have the Computer resolve it for you. You can in-slave the population after you successfuly take a settlement or put them to the knife. You can micro-mange to a depth I have never witness before!!! What really inmpressed me about this game is it is user-friendly!!! Anyone can play this game! All those other RTS games I previously mentioned, most are so confusing and boring to play I don't even bother anymore.No, I never played this series of games before and it may not be as good as MTW but I know that you can do anything you want with the game. It's endless and it has more diplomacy and stradegy than any game I have seen to date (2004) including all those RTS games I mentioned. I should of played Shogun/MTW and I didn't but I don't regret it. Besides, this is more up-to-date than Shogun/MTW?In all, I think you guys are right (most of you guys) about this game. It's awesome! The world map is the best thing going for this game and the battle map makes this game un-believeable!There will be always someone who will not like a game but for you guys and you know who you are, this game is better than what your willing to admit, you can't fool an old RTS gamer now can you????"
3646544,B000YIWVA0,"Good for the cleaning, not so much for the brushing","I had high hopes for this brush, since I have to do a lot of brushing and I hate stabbing my fingers while cleaning a regular slicker brush. Well, the &#34;cleaning&#34; function on this brush works great---press the button and just swipe the hair off and into the trash---but the &#34;brushing&#34; function isn't effective for my dogs.On my very furry, fluffly-coated dog, the metal spikes on this brush are simply not long enough to reach down into the undercoat. It pulled out some loose hairs from his topcoat, but none of the downy undercoat. The dog is used to brushing, so I was definitely pressing this brush pretty hard into his fur. A regular slicker brush pulls out way more loose hair.On my semi-furry, coarse-coated dog, this brush removed hair on the first part of the stroke but then deposited the loose hairs back on him as I pulled the brush through! It seems like the small pins don't grip the loose hairs well enough, and his dense, coarse fur just &#34;grabs&#34; the hairs back. So, useless on that dog. Again, I have no problems using a regular slicker brush on his coat, so I think the issue here is the length and spacing of the pins.I have a Dyson vacuum attachment that has the same type of cleaning mechanism as this product, with the bonus that the hair sucks straight into the Dyson when you press the button. And of course a Furminator pulls mountains of hair off these dogs. I'll go back to those two along with the longer-spike regular slicker brush and donate this one to the shelter!"

It is well made, sounds like it has a well-built motor, and is submersible.However, this shaver does not give me a good shave; it misses hairs. Maybe this is due to the fine beard I have, but my old Norelco never had that problem. Also, if I have more than a day's growth, this shaver is useless."

1850885,B00000JY9N,I'm a convert:  Air Supply is AWESOME,"I grew up listening to Air Supply and watching their cheesy lip-synching escapades on 'Solid Gold' (remember THAT?) and mostly because of my friends, I always viewed them as a wimpy band that had bubble-gum musical releases that had no substance...boy was I WRONG!  I always harbored a few positive thoughts about their music, but about a year ago I had the opportunity to see Air Supply perform in a very intimate setting (Cactus Petes Gala Showroom in Jackpot, Nevada) and I was just blown away at how really fantastic they are not just live, but in general.  I came away with a healthy respect for these guys, and a renewed love of their music, which by the way stands the test of time very well.Both of these guys sound great, and about my only gripe is they didn't sing 'Making Love Out Of Nothing At All' because they were heading straight from the performance back to the recording studio and the song is particularly hard on their vocal chords and they were trying hard to keep their voices in tip-top shape for their next recording session.  While I can understand this, I STILL wanted to hear the song.  It in NO WAY means I had lost anything from my experience at the concert.IF you EVER have the opportunity to see these guys perform, take some time out and do yourself a big favor and pay for an evening you will not soon forget.  This album truly is a great example of how good the late 70's and early 80's really were.  If you are a fan of Air Supply and do NOT own this CD, you should probably pick it up and add it to your collection, you will NOT be disappointed.  If you are NOT a fan of Air Supply, either you just haven't had a chance to get to know them, or you don't have a proper grasp of what good music is.  Sorry but the truth hurts."

227496,B0009MFPZY,Tips and is uneven,"So, for a start I want to say that the product does inflate OK, and, that is all that it does OK. The only way you can use this is if you have the exact weight persons on both sides of the bed, giving EXACTLY the same weight on the item, otherwise, the one person has to be exactly in the middle of the bed and that is not really possible for disabled persons that you need to have a food tray to feed them. The person needs to be on one side or the other for the tray to be able to work when feeding.  If you use it with the person on say the right side of the bed, with a tray, the other side moves up MUCH FURTHER than the side that the person is eating on the tray, pretty much just pushing that person out of bed onto the floor. Stupid. Needs to pump up equally on both sides for this to be even a ""good"" product, and in my opinion, this is a very ""poor"", not well thought out product."
3715796,B005LVJM4I,Noisy,"I've bought a couple dozen different drinking fountains for my cats over the years.  It doesn't matter how much or how little you pay for them, they all have one thing in common  --  a cheap, crummy pump.  This one is typical in that it is noisy.  The pump is inside a plastic casing which also probably amplifies the sound. This casing also holds the filter, but I don't think the filter gets much use because the top of the pump casing will not stay attached and is always floating when I lift the tear drop. That means the water is not pulled through the filter. My experience is that the reliability of these pumps is very poor, even when following the diligent recommended cleaning regimen.  They may last through the warranty, but be prepared for sticker shock if you need to buy a replacement (and you'll get the same junk).  This could be a really great fountain  --  fun for cats, safe for cats, and easy to clean. The pump cost it 3 stars."

2745331,B00064AEOC,Professional & Emotive Show but Psychotic Filming.,"I missed the show in Tokyo and have been kicking myself ever since. Thankfully, this DVD provides enough of an ""experience"" to absolve me of my sin. In a nutshell, a fantastic tour with David at his best backed up by a great band but shot in psychotic fashion.I've always loved Bowie's alter-personas, in particular the Thin White Duke, but here we have David Bowie as himself, if that's possible. He's laid back, relaxed, and delivers a knock-out performance. He's like a kid in a candy store and enjoying every minute. It's also remarkable that his voice and vocal range are still intact when so many others of his generation have lost that ability. Listen to Five Years with your eyes closed and you would swear that Ziggy Stardust is alive and well.In an age where true, live performances seem to be an exception rather than the norm, many young artists could learn from this and realize that it takes hard work and practice to deliver Live. Yes, it's harder than lip synching or singing to a background track. And what a great band it is: Mike Garson (keyboards), Sterling Campbell (drums), Catherine Russell (keyboards, guitar, vocals), Gail Ann Dorsey (Bass & vocals), Earl Slick & Gerry Leonard (guitars). This band is tight and gifted. Bowie, already renowned for his selection of musicians for tours and albums, has again assembled a primo supporting cast.My favorites: Heroes, Cactus, Fantastic Voyage (beautiful), I'm Afraid of Americans, Ashes to Ashes (very interesting guitar by Monsieur Slick), Life on Mars, and especially Under Pressure where Bowie duets with Gail Ann Dorsey. Wow, I never knew who Gail was but I certainly do now. What a talent she is. One of the best renditions I've ever heard and it's live!!If it weren't for the fragmented editing and ""special effects"" which are more annoying than accentual, this would be a no-brainer Five Stars. You can bet that I won't make the same mistake twice next time Bowie comes to town."

2858097,B000EDWKXI,A very fun comadey of errors,I was really surprised with this film I thought it would be good but not as good as it was. The film is really fun from start to finish maybe becouse it's a fun movie of errors from mistaken identities and so on. The story is fast paced and has many funny moments. The acting is also really good from Heath Ledger to Sierean Miller and Oliver Platt who steals every scene. The film is really fun and a must watch.
1382608,B000LD3S5K,Doesn't Perform,"This was my dream come true for the playstation: a controller not designed to fit a five foot three japanese guy!!  It looks pretty cool, and feels a lot like a 360 controller with more grip; my excitement shrouded my better thinking until the day came when i put myself out of my misery and destroyed it.Unacceptable Terrible Qualities of this Controller:1: The ""re-chargeable"" battery wouldn't so i had to use AA.2.  You have to occupy a usb port while using this controller3.  I coulnd't sync to the ps3 with out the usb plug4.  The Sticks are un-sensitive to the point where aiming is improbable:  either sluggish movement, or all the way fast.5.  The buttons (epecially R1 L1) stick on the regular, but that can be fixed with (sparse amounts of) oil.so this thing felt great but sucked big time.  Pretty much worthless considering you can get a generic wired ps3 controller for around ten bucks."

2091355,6300184250,Skill and High Art.,"This is Fahrenheit the way it was meant to be.  Truffaut is a master film maker.  I also recommend &quot;Two English Girls&quot; and &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; as well.  It's impossible not to think of the Heinrich Heine quote, &quot;Where one burns books; one will soon burn people&quot; while watching it.  The inversion of a fire fighters who, rather than put out fires, start them was a very innovative idea on Bradbury's part.  The main character is quite compelling and easily evokes our sympathy.  This work is prescient and timeless.  In today's talk show era, do books still not remain dangerous and subversive?"

1299209,B000RW0GT6,Wonderful Guitar!,"Although not through Amazon.com, I recently purchased a Seagull S6 Original acoustic guitar. I compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range, as well as with the Seagull Entourage acoustic-electric which was also in the general price range.  The S6 has a nicely consistent tone which, although maybe a little too bright for some players' tastes, projects very well.  Some reviewers and guitarists with whom I've talked wonder how Seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in North America for the price.  I think that I found part of the answer when I looked inside some of the Seagulls.  The braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars.  Looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it, though, you'd never know.  I find the 1.8"" neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left-hand fingering.  It's a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width.  For me, it works.  Some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar.  Seagull does offer other models, by the way, that have a more traditional width.  The slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale Gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models:  just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering, but not so short as to cause floppy strings.  I couldn't be happier with the Seagull S6, especially for the price!"
1776720,B00339B0TU,Great Long Life Power Option - Until Meltdown,"DO NOT leave this battery charging in storage. See my update at the bottom.Original Review:This battery recently powered my Coleman 4D XPS LED Duo Lantern for two long winter camping nights in sub-freezing temperature. The light dimmed in the near zero temperature, but it was still bright enough to see by, and it never went out. I ran the light approximately 8 hours each night and it still had juice when I got home. It recharged completely in less than an hour.My one complaint is that the power plug connects at the bottom of the battery, so it can't sit flat while charging. This connection should be on the side or recessed like you see on a cordless phone base. This is minor and does not really affect performance.One missing feature is a power meter that let's you know if your battery is fully charged or nearly dead.This battery will save many disposables from going into the trash and it keeps me from running out at the last second for new batteries.Update: This battery melted down while on the charger. It was on the charger for about one month. I took it off to use it and noticed the LED was out. It was really hot to the touch. The port where you plug it into the AC adapter was visibly melted. I'm glad that it didn't start a fire. DO NOT leave this battery charging in storage."

He's a good boy, great with kids, but pretty much caves in to other dogs at every chance he gets.  I gave him one of these biscuits and I didn't notice a change, so the next day I gave him two.  He started acting weird, not in a good way.  He started chewing on his arms a bunch, which he never does.  Maybe it's an allergy?  But regardless, I did not notice a difference in his behavior besides the arm chewing, which again he's never done before.  It might work for your dog but it didn't for mine."

2713631,B000291Q52,Promising film ruined by Bettany's dead energy,"I enjoyed the book by Barry Unsworth titled, ""Morality Play."" Although slight, it has a lot of atmosphere, fine writing and period detail. The main problem with the movie is in the casting. Willem Dafore is fine as the Player's leader, even though I would have preferred a British actor in the role. The rest of the cast add nothing to their underwritten parts. A charismatic lead might have compensated, but Paul Bettany is so utterly colorless that he drags the movie down until it is impossible for it to recover. Tedious!"

This is one of the Best CD's released in 2012. Springsteen's being my top favorite.

1847940,B00000AFF9,Jigga just DOESN'T represent here,"So much has been said about this album, that Jay-Z was &quot;completely in a zone, focused and creative&quot; during the making of this album. After getting a few years of perspective on this album, how can ANYONE say that this album is EXCELLENT or BORDERLINE CLASSIC? How? This album might have sold many units, but top notch records sales DO NOT equal a classic album. Vol.2 Hard Knock Life was hailed by critics and fans alike as some of Jay-Z's best material. I &quot;respectfully&quot; disagree. Here's the COMPLETE review:Album Highlights: Hard Knock Life, A Week Ago, Money,Cash,Hoes(w/DMX), and N**** What N**** Who. Every other song on this album is ABSOLUTE filler and it's not worth your time in listening to it.Production: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards down. Not the best production in the world. Timbaland and Swizz made the best tracks, Everything else is either poorly composed or mediocre at best(check Kid Capri's track).Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards down. Jigga represents on the tracks mentioned in the album highlights section. On everything else, lyrically, is not material to gloat about.Originality: Thumbs WAY down. If Jay-Z would have done this album in a way like The Blueprint, it would have been better, but since NEARLY every song features another artist, this album loses SERIOUS points with me.The Last Word: Not too much to say here that I haven't said already. Is this album worth buying for the four best songs? Certainly not. Jay-Z didn't slip up with In My Lifetime Vol.1. He slipped up here, and it shows. Overall, I can't seriously recommend this album. But if you consider this a must have of any type, be prepared to be disappointed. Otherwise, don't even bother."
3743877,B0006IX87S,Crazy not to have one.,"If you RV, you want one of these. We never use the fresh water tanks in our RV for drinking (we buy bottled water for that), but for washing dishes, bathing, and other purposes, we do. So having clean water is still important.While no inexpensive filter will provide 100% clean safe drinking water, at least these filters get rid of most of the gunk that might clog up your water system."
3591909,B0002A5VK2,I'll stick with activated carbon,"I know A LOT of people like this product, which is why I got it. The activated carbon performed fine in my tank and the only reason I decided to buy the Purigen was from its popularity and I wanted to give my tank the best possible. I've also used a bunch of the products from Seachem and I absolutely love the company.It took about 2 months until the Purigen began clogging up my filtration and needed to be ""regenerated"" and this is where my problems stem from. I'm meticulous when it comes to details and I followed them perfectly from the Seachem website. I even went above and beyond by letting it sit days longer in the dechlorinator then called for.Despite my efforts something happened in the regeneration process and it resulted in the death of my fish and shrimp that I kept in the tank shortly after I added the purigen back to the tank, including the babies unfortunately. Due to how well the tank was doing (the fact that both shrimp and fish were giving birth, no deaths, etc) the only explanation I could think of was the regenerated purigen. I'm 100% confident that I followed the regeneration process perfectly and based on the input from others who have regenerated their purigen with no ill effects I can't really put the blame on anyone. Something happened, and neither I nor Seachem can explain it.I switched back to Activated Carbon and I won't use Purigen ever again, but I still recommend Seachem products to anyone, just not this one."

1745677,B000V77B4K,Bright from the start!,"Normally with other 23 watt CFLs I have used, there is always a little warm up time before they achieve full brightness. These bulbs have a very short warm up of around a minute before they produce brilliant warm soft light.All six bulbs came to me undamaged and like I always do, I pulled out my sharpie marker to put the date on each one before I installed them. I hit the switch and waited...and soon my room was bright! Like...really bright! Like 1600 lumens per bulb times six bright once they hit their warm up time! Just remember as with all CFLs, do not use them in areas that get switched on and off a lot, keep these burning for 15 minutes or more every time and they will last a long long time.I had previously been using some free 23 watt bulbs from my power company which took forever to warm up and they produced a sickly yellow cast light that made me really bored and put me into full squint mode due to the dimness. This was the complete opposite! If you have dim bulbs or want to switch to brighter bulbs, try these CFLs!"

1800486,B005Z29U6S,"7 Days In Power Outage, Bright As Sun For Almost 1/2 Mile","For decades, we always owned Mag-lite Flashlights, which have always had high ratings, and we thought were really great until now.  Owning this Coast HP314 Long Range Focusing 1132 Lumen LED Flashlight makes our largest Mag-lite flashlight look like a match stick. I would never have thought that anyone would actually need a $350.00 flashlight for regular home use until now. I would say the most important use for our flashlight has been in power outages. When the lights go out in the dark, we always make our way to our flashlight, then with flashlight in hand to our candles and matches. With more and more power outages now with our antiquated power grids and horrible storm weather, we found this Coast HP314 to be THE ONLY flashlight every household needs to own.For 7 full nights, this Coast HP314 was kept on every night from dusk to dawn and it lasted on the low 95 lumens for the entire week! That's 4 D batteries lasting an entire week in the dark! The 95 lumens is actually so bright, that we placed the flashlight in the center of our ranch house, and could see into parts of every room- it's that bright! You can't even imagine how bright the high 1132 lumens light is- it's like the sun in your hand! The 4 D batteries on this high 1132 lumens light lasts 4 hours, which is great in itself. This light shines almost a 1/2 mile with either a spotlight that is 7 and a half feet in diameter, or a smaller more intense spot beam. If you hear noises outside at night and are checking to see what is out there, you will see every blade of grass and every leaf in your neighbor's trees for blocks. I was astounded at what I saw, when I stood at the top of my street in the dark and could see for several blocks as this light illuminated every car almost a half mile away.When we had this light on in our house for an entire week, we could see strands of dust we never knew were on the ceiling. These are hair thin dust strands that during the day, you cannot see with the naked eye. This light is like bringing the sun into your house. Even shining this light up into the trees, you can see every leaf at 2:30 in the morning- and with this spotlight the area you see is huge! One of our neighbors works for the Coast Guard and he said this light is similar to the flashlights they use for search and rescue on the water at night! He said Coast makes lights so bright that you could find a needle in a haystack, they are that powerful. Once you own this Coast flashlight, you will know this is the only flashlight you will ever need for both security reasons as well as for power outages.The Coast HP 314 flashlight comes in it's own sturdy carrying case- the fabric is heavy duty like good luggage with a handle. Included also are the 4 batteries, shoulder strap, belt ring, bezel ring, tail cap cover and instructions. The flashlight is heavy, yet easy to handle. It is simple to turn the light head forward or backward to either focus on the accu-spot small beam or wide spotlight beam. To lock the beam in the position you want, you just turn the head of the light to the left. As for the 3 different light modes, you simply press the button- once for the 1132 lumens high beam, second time for the strobe beam and the third time for the 95 lumens low beam. Coast also gives a lifetime limited guarantee to be free of defects in materials and workmanship. The flashlight's aluminum casing is also waterproof. Coast also gives you a free mini flashlight for the price of postage with the included website information.For Amazon's much lower price than the actual retail price of this must have flashlight, you can't go wrong. You are also getting a mini flashlight for the price of postage. Just having a flashlight that illuminates a good part of our house for a full week during a power outage on 4 D batteries is worth the price, but the added security you get with being able to see in your yard with a spotlight as bright as the sun in the middle of the night makes this the only flashlight you will ever need for you and your family."

Don't waste your money and don't be fooled by overbudgeted videos that intice you to this trash.

I also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when I took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced. Shitty pedal."

1733328,B000KICSGQ,buy a right angle drill instead,"I bought one from Lowe's a year ago. Used it sparingly to screw and unscrew wood /drywall screws in tight spaces. After about two month later, the gears stripped. Definitely not worth your money."
1401106,B000ZK6950,This game keeps the series alive.,"I have been a resident evil fan since the beginning. I played all the main RE titles that came out on various systems over the years. When RE4 came out I thought the game would be similar to all the other RE's that came before it. Obviously it wasnt. And thats not a bad thing either. If you liked RE4 than u will like this one too.The gameplay is very similar to RE4. Only difference is that the graphics are better and the action is more intense. You still cannot walk while you have ur guns aimed at someone but thats not really a big deal to me.The graphics, as i mentioned, are really nice. That shouldnt be a surprise there. The acting in the game is pretty good too. But its the action that makes this RE the best one yet to me.There really isnt any puzzles that needs to be solved in this game as in previous titles. ITs pretty straight forwarD And u can get through the entire game without needing a strategy guide. You may need one for a few small parts but for the most part  the game is easy as far as navigating.If the navigating part is easy then the monsters are the difficult part. There are 4 difficulty levels. The first 3 (amateur, normal, vetern) are available to u right at the begining. The 4th difficulty (professional) wont be available until you complete the veteran difficulty once. I havent played veteran yet but based on some strategy guides I looked at its tough. The monsters are a lot stronger and they do more damage to u than u to them. And professional mode is 10 times as difficult as veteran. But that is the way it is with all games so if you play this game a lot then professional  mode wont b too intense. Also, this game has a feature where the longer you go without dying the harder it will become. The difficulty scale ranges from 0-10. Zero being the easiest. There is a limit though. If you are playing amateur mode (easy), for example, then the difficulty will go from 0-4. It wont go higher than that until you choose a harder difficulty. If you are playing normal it will go from 2-6 or something like that. Of course if you keep dying then the difficulty will stay at the lowest setting based on what difficulty u are using until you get good at the game. Professional mode, however, stays at a 10 difficulty level no matter how many times you die. Veteran mode maxes out at 9.They gave a lot of weapons in the game. Several different pistols, magnums, shotguns, etc. Lots of guns in this game. And most weapons can be upgraded as well. Just like in RE4, you find jewels and money in game that you can use to buy better weapons and and also upgrade them. The only ammo you can buy is grenade launcher ammo. Bullets and even grenades that u throw have to be found as you play the game. Ammo is scarce in this game as is health packs. (yes they still have green herbs and first aid spray cans).RE5 has always been about rewarding players when you beat the game and this one is no different. Ammo is scarce, yes, but you can get unlimited ammo for all the guns in the game except the grenade launcher i think. The way you get unlimited ammo is u upgrade that particular weapon fully and go to bonus features afterwards. You have to purchase the infinite ammo pack for the particular gun you want and then you have to turn it on. Its a really nice feature and you also can unlock speacial weapons that u only get after u upgrade a certain gun. If you beat the game under 5 hours you get the infinte rocket launcher.I dont have any major gripes about the game except i wish you can move around while aiming but maybe if RE6 comes out they might add that. This game is really fun and it has a lot of replay value to it. There are other features you unlock too after beating it once but you have to check them out yourselves.If you like RE games and 3rd person shooters than you might want to check this one out."

I purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it's worth.  But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture!Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommending product.

1864476,B0000AGWFX,one of the best hip hop albums to come out in years.........,"i have always been a fan of outkast since they came out with 'rosa parks' (which is my fav outkast song to date).  they have something different about them to have the staying power they have... it is about time the went commercial... i think if a artist does well with a certian audience and crosses over and dominates they are a true star... OUTKAST is the brightest right now...i like speakerboxxx better than the love below... he beats are crazy and big boi is a great rapper.... the best track on big boi's side is 'ghettomusick'... this is crazy... it sounds similar to 'B.O.B.' but crazier.... i like the transition to mad to soft r & b singing by patti labelle...the best track on andre's side is probably 'my favourite things' this is a different song because andre does not say a word in this song.... the beat is bananas and is a up to date hip hop update of the song....'spread', 'unhappy', ' i like the way you move', 'happy valentines day', 'hey ya', 'dracula's wedding', ' flip flop rock', and the hidden track on andre's side are instant classic... these songs propelled the album to win a grammy....outkast is here to stay... but just wondering how they are going to top this one....1 million stars out of 5 stars... pure brilliance"

These are very sturdy and never leak.  It would be nice if they were a little larger (since my dog sometimes pees on the edge of them and it winds up going under the pad), but they do the trick.  Four Paws makes an extra large, but I haven't been able to find a reasonable price for a large box of them."

3761607,B00CCOBOI4,Please read...,"There's a long checklist of things you should do before evening buying this item. I'll go through some but do urge stringent research before committing to this product way over and above my review.1) Do you even need protection? Put a few thousand miles on the car per year or the paint is already chipped. Then the answer is probably no.2) Is it worth the massive extra expense of going for a professional solution foregoing one at this price point? If your car is worth fifty grand plus then I would say so.3) Are you prepared for a more matte, cloudy finish on the front of your car? If not then no clear bra solution is for you and you should look for something else.4) Are you experienced with spray painting, do you know how much or how little to apply? If not then this shouldn't be your first attempt.5) Were you aware that this is a temporary solution that requires almost yearly attention? If not are you okay with that?6)Arre you able to let the product acclimatize in fair temperature of 65 or so then work at that temp? Too hot it won't work, too cold it really won't work.Okay with that out of the way the reason I mention all this is due to the current negative reviews. It isn't for motorcycles, it isn't for all over body protection, it WILL dull the area it is protecting, it requires a nice temp to use, it helps if you're comfortable with spraying, prep work done right is essential etc. You can't just shake the can and get going.I applied this, based on the above points, to my recent Yaris's front bumper and tiny hood. And you know it looks great, it works great and I'm happy that on a car worth less than ten grand I didn't have to outlay five hundred plus on professional stuff nor did I have to settle for a plastic black bra. My car looks great and is very well protected which for the price is no bad thing.Yes, I could point a finger at 3M for seemingly over-stressing the simplicity but some personal responsibility must also be applied, especially those here who attempted to do this in extremely low temperatures due to the time of year.Please go in prepared to work before your purchase and work during the installation. Follow the manufacturer's rules and be patient. Read up on other's experiences and set a few hours aside. For less than a valentine's night out you could have a very well protected car that looks great.Very pleased with this system and if you look around you may find just how expensive an alternative clear bra solution is. Good luck."
1295306,B0002E2GMY,Nice upgrade,"These Fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide(tree). Installed on a Tele I built. Much less surface of the string touching.

These look like rollers, but are not rollers. They do work well. and I will purchase more for other Tele's and StratsPros: Well made  Cons; None I can think ofSleek, well designedQuick installImproved soundInexpensive upgrade"

When I gave it to my daughter (thinking it may just have been me) she did not care for it either and commented that it kind of tasted like dog biscuits.  That is precisely what it became and our dogs LOVE it.  If you buy this be prepared for a salty taste and give it a fair chance as I see by other posts it may be something you love; I just didn't happen to be one of those people, unfortuantely we fell into the hate catagory."
1816717,B00CPTD5AQ,What a disappointment!!!,"Just like many others, I am returning this and sadly admit I'm a very disappointed early adopter.After HOURS of faulty calibration I gave up on this lovely lock and returning to Amazon for refund. I have called customer service but let me guess... the Kevo reps were up to their heads with calls, I opened a case but they didn't bother to return a call.The range of the iPhone when used as an eKey is ridiculously short, no more than a foot away from the lock itself. that does not make any sense.In my case the entry door is elevated about a foot from the ground, which makes the distance between your pocket to the phone even longer.This is an impractical implementation of technology, if I have to take my phone out of my pocket and put it against the lock, I'd rather use a simple key and unlock it without the blinking light.Thanks QuickSet, try again, but you won't have my vote. hopefully the friends at Nest would think of something more useful."

1873147,B000E5N62U,Won't disappoint the Dan Fandom,"Fagen has crafted some true works of art on this, his 3rd solo album.The best track on the album is definitely H Gang with it's heavily jazz influenced rock sound. It's like a jazz jam session gone horribly (read to mean wonderfully) wrong. The title track is nothing special.What I Do, Brite Nitegown, and Mars Shut The Garden Door are also truly inventive and enjoyable treks in to the jazz/rock world of Fagen's creation.The remaining tracks, The Great Pagoda of Funn, Security Joan, and The Night Belongs to Moana are certainly enjoyable but don't spark any great chord with me.Still, as a life-long Dan-fan, I am happy to hear anything that Fagen puts down and can only hope for more of the same.This was not a classic like Fagen's debut, The Nightfly, but it is a good album with moments of brilliance."
247258,B000GCJT8Q,Terrible applicator - would not use again,"When I've gone to the doctor for colds the last two years, my blood pressure has been high. I've never had that happen before, but they explained that over the counter decongestants can sometimes have that side-effect. The doctors prescribed Flonase instead and it worked wonderfully without raising my blood pressure. You squirt the Flonase into each nostril and that's it.Given that you must have a prescription for Flonase, I hoped that the Good Sense Nasal Spray Sinus would be a viable alternative for me. I have used it a couple of times now for congestion due to allergies and again this week when I had some congestion from a cold. I think it worked OK as a decongestant, but I don't plan to buy this anytime in the future. The applicator was just not easy or comfortable. Where the Flonase simply inserts upright into your nostril and is easily pumped to release a dose, the Good Sense Nasal Spray is clumsy, with a foul tasting liquid going up my nose into my throat.I'd rather go to the doctor or the clinic to get a prescription for Flonase than to try the Good Sense Nasal Spray again."
1603562,B0029JDUO8,Good but not my favorite flavor,"First, let me just say that the Xyla mint products overall are great.  The Xylitol really does clean your teeth.  If you have a meal and cannot brush afterwards, instead put a few of these mints in your mouth and run them around your teeth a bit.  You will be amazed to discover that the sticky plaque will actually vanish right off your teeth, as if you'd brushed.  This stuff really works.  (And I would also HIGHLY recommend the Squiggle Tooth Builder toothpaste, which also contains Xylitol.)This particular flavor does taste like chocolate mint; however the nature of these lozenges is such that they are a crumbly, almost chalky sort of concoction.  This isn't as awful as that makes it sound, but this isn't going to be like eating an actual piece of chocolate.  I used to be an Altoids addict, and I find I prefer the peppermint flavor (even over Altoids, now).As to the concern about ""laxative effects"", I noticed a mild effect the first few times I ate rather a lot of these; but I don't get any such effect now.  I think one is supposed to consume around 3-5 mints following a meal if you cannot brush, and/or three times daily, as the standard for dental health benefit.  I did read an article that also cited a study showing that people who regularly used this kind of Xylitol product found that it would cure sinus problems after a few months of use too, which I thought was interesting.  I myself feel that this is the case for me too.  Apparently just keeping the bad bacteria under control more in your mouth will also help keep it from moving up into the sinuses (I guess)....Anyway, personally if you are just trying Xylitol candy for the first time, and you do like mint, I would suggest the peppermint; but then if you become hooked like so many of us, you can branch out and try the other flavors too."

61747,B005U30660,Excellent!,"Very nice Epic 4G Touch case.  It met every expectation I had.  It's not silicone, it's more like rubbery plastic.  Slips on and off easily and the cutouts are perfect.  I take it off often as I use cradles to charge my phone.  The only caveat when removing it is to start removing from the bottom of the phone instead of the top.  When removing from the top of the phone, I have accidentally opened the back cover of the phone many times.The biggest plus is that it makes the very slippery Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch no longer slippery!  And it does not add any significant amount of bulk to the very svelte S2.  Most people don't realize that there is a cover on the phone.I think I'll order more to keep in the car and the office."

After consulting with support, we determined that it was faulty. No problem. It happens. The seller took care of it and I got a replacement. The second device worked great out of the box. After less than two months it has stopped showing up as a Bluetooth device to connect to. Now I just have a Qi charger with a clock. My 30 days is up, so I cant send it back. I wont be buying another one. I would pay twice the price for the same thing built to last."

3585409,B000084F2Q,old model was better - this one loud & no flow adjustment,"I had the old model of this fountain for 6 years - it was wonderful. The old model had an adjustable flow and was totally silent. The motor died on it finally. This new model does not have an adjustable water flow speed and is very loud, in fact mine was defective, the noise was too loud and my cat would not drink from it. A waste of time, energy and money to  order this, assemble it, find out it doesnt work, call for return, pack it up and ship it back, and order a different brand, which I ordered the Drinkwell fountain hopefully i'll have better luck with that one.Too bad they changed the design. Hint to Petmate: if its not broken, don't fix it! Add back the flow adjuster and make the motor silent again. Some cats are scared off by a noisy fountain that flows too fastUpdate 4-25-12: Spoke to Petmate, they seem to think the loud pump noise is ok, they havent responded to two of my letters complaining about the loud pumps. I've gone through 3 pumps now trying to get a quieter one, and they are all loud. They switched pump manufacturers and the new pumps they are making are lower quality louder and probably dont last as long. The very first Petmate fountain I ordered 10 years ago was extremely quiet, had an on/off switch and flow lever adjustment. The new pump is LOUD AND POOR QUALITY. PETMATE GET ON THE BALL WITH FIXING THESE LOUD PUMPS!On the PLUS side, this water fountain design is the best out there in my opinion. My cat doesnt like dripping water and the water chute with water drinking area this one has is great. Could be the best pet fountain out there if they started doing quality and noise control on their pumps! Probably sacificing quality for profit like most large companies today. The pumps are probably made in China sweatshops where everything is poor quality junk and the CEOs care more about their large salary than creating happy, satisfied customers. A sad commentary on American society and meanwhile my cat won't drink from this often enough because the noise makes him skittish."

3665562,B001ND9BHG,"""Salmon oil"" does not mean it's salmon flavor - it's still mint flavor!","I've used the PetzLife spray in the past, and it did work wonderfully for my pets' breath.  Can't say if it did much for tartar, because I couldn't use it long enough to tell.  My cats and dog _hated_ the spray action and couldn't stand the mint flavor.  I never finished the bottle.  I started brushing their teeth instead after getting dentals, and they likewise hated mint flavor toothpaste like I was putting acid in their mouths, but they'd come willingly for beef/poultry/seafood toothpaste.  That's the backstory.I have a couple young feral-born cats I'd hoped to use this gel on, as they are now 3 years old.  It said &#34;Salmon Oil&#34; all over the sell page and the bottle, so I thought, &#34;Great, they'll love it!&#34;  I planned to apply it with my finger.  Well, when I got the bottle, opened it after quite a struggle, and got the first squeeze on my finger, it reeked very strongly of mint!I was very dismayed after spending so much on this product to find that it's the same ingredients as the mint flavor just with salmon oil added!  I tasted it, and it's 50/50 mint and salmon, which is disgusting-tasting.  My fault for not reading the label, which was clearly posted in the product photos, but you have to admit that putting &#34;Salmon Oil&#34; all over the page and packaging is MISLEADING!I tried it on my dog, and she reacted again like I'd put acid in her mouth and was wary of me brushing her teeth again for at least a week until she trusted that mint was no longer going to be used on her.  I let the one feral cat who likes to lick animal-flavored toothpaste off my finger smell it, and he was not interested in the slightest.This product DID make my dog's breath much better that night than when I use regular pet toothpaste in beef/poultry flavors, but they all abhor both the spray and the gel for the fact that it has an intense mint flavor.  IF YOUR PETS DON'T LIKE MINT, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"

531274,B00HB0WUO6,An excellent multivitamin which also supports your immune system.,"I have used numerous brands of multivitamins over the years, but this is the first one (Airborne Everybody Immune Support Plus Multivitamin) that also included immune support ingredients as well.  I began using this product about two weeks ago and my wife recently had a very bad cold, sneezing all over the place.  In the past I  normally I would also catch her cold; however, since taking this multivitamin I have not caught her cold.I am not saying this Airborne Everyday Immune Support Multivitamin is a cure for ever catching a cold, but it certainly may have helped to boost my immune system to some degree. Another reason this product really interested me is because I have several immune system related medical problems and I am always seeking ways to boost my immune system.This multivitamin is loaded with a wide range of vitamins  such as A, C,D, E, B6, as well as folic acid, biotin Iodine, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium.  It also has Proprietary Herbal Blend and Amino Acid Blend. So far I am very happy with this immune support multivitamin. This is a one tablet a day multivitamin and I intend to keep taking this product in the future.Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: The Samurai Soul: An old warrior's poetic tribute)"

1824386,B000001A5X,"A musical, spiritual, and emotional journey like no other!","The best way that that I can describe this album in a nutshell is basically as, an airy journey through the heart and mind of an observant soul searcher as he responds to his social surroundings... for the most part anyway :-).  This album is unbelievably coherent both sonically and thematically, and just incredibly even in tone all throughout.  ""What's Going On"" is a true concept album in every sense and is the first great one that Motown produced. It is probably the first great one in all of soul music.  This particular piece of work is special even when compared to most concept albums because while most great concept albums present a strong, unified statement or vision, few embody such a grand idealism.  Gaye is the ultimate idealist all throughout, which is really what defines this album, and why it still resonates so well today.  It is almost unbelievable that Barry Gordy did not want to release it.  I guess that Gordy didn't think that this album was kitschy enough for the public; ""oh no, oh no, all of these unfamiliar words and grand ideas, not on my label!"" (Note: this is not an actual quote from Gordy, just my own feeble and unapologetically sarcastic attempt at regressive mind reading).  I've read that Mr. Gordy asked Marvin Gaye, ""what in the world is Ecology""? (Now that really is close to an actual quote).  Well Mr. Gordy, Ecology is basically the study of how organisms interact and interrelate with their environment, and it was brilliant of Gaye to use that as the core idea for a song here because the idea fits into the album's concept perfectly.  The lyrics of ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)"", all of the lyrics on this album in fact, are so incredibly effective because they are so convincingly heartfelt.  It is a blessing to all of us that Gaye finally got this album released.  Story has it that Marvin Gaye had recorded the first version of this album, but decided to change it because he was unsatisfied with the final results.  There was just something missing.  That  ""something"" was bass virtuoso James Jamerson.  James Jamerson was simply B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T, and he could embellish within a set song structure magnificently enhancing the melody, all while being absolutely impeccable rythmically.  Story has it that Gaye went out looking for Jamerson, and found him playing in a local club in Detroit.  He convinced Jamerson to come back and play on the album, and he ended up giving some of the best performances of his career.  Legend has it that on the title track, Jamerson plays bass on the whole song while lying on his back on the floor in the studio because he was simply more comfortable there !!!!!(Listen to the title track picturing that, focus on the bass, and simply sit back and marvel at Jamerson's genius).  It should also be noted, and this is something that I rarely hear mentioned, that this album is probably the greatest example of the influence that the influx of jazz musicians crossing over to the soul and R&B scenes had on the increase in the level of sophistication of the musicianship, and the overall spike in the quality of the material coming out of these scenes in the 60's, with their influence remaining strong throughout the 70's. The Funk Brothers (the in house musicians for Motown), we're all local jazz musicians who used the skill and savvy that they had acquired in that arena, to become an almost immeasurable influence on popular music in general; from R& B to Soul, and from Funk to Rock & Roll (a certain well-known British invasion group spent a large portion of the early part of their career trying to imitate these guys).  This album is their greatest single work.  And last but certainly not least, Marvin Gaye is one of the greatest pure vocalist ever.  His extra smooth tenor is one of the most distinct voices that I have ever heard, and it adds immensely to the effectiveness of his interpretations of the material here.  This album works brilliantly as a cohesive whole, and the sum total is about the most genuinely transcendent album that I've ever heard.  This is one legendary album that truly does live up to all the hype, and it should be a part of every music lover's collection!"

1459344,B003M2T8IS,The great shooter that could have been...,"Singularity isn't going to be setting records as a great Sci-Fi shooter  but it is a game that is a lot of fun, and has moments of old school FPS that some shooter games today seem to be unable to reproduce.  However does it stand strong or did the ""singularity"" devour the gameplay as well as time itself?Gameplay: As I mentioned earlier,  Singularity has a nice old school feel to it at times.  It reminded me when shooters were just simply shooters. Run through a level fighting enemies, not overloading you with graphic awe.  I attempted Singularity on ""HARD"" and was actually a little disappointed by this.  Hard really wasn't hard.  It felt like ""easy"" w/ enemies that did ungodly amount of damage to you. It did make me use strategy though instead of hulking through areas like I have super armor or something.  The gameplay mechanics are a nice blend of well polished FPS mechanics, with a very nifty time manipulation element that lets you influence certain objects in  your environment(E99 infused stuff) and then pulls various mechanics from other games.  The ""chrono-step"" is my favorite. Similar to Dead Space's objective tracking system, but this looks into the future to find out where you are going to goSound/Story:  Very creative storyline that has multiple endings (3 to be exact).  The game keeps you guessing as to who is the good guy and who is the bad guy.  Hidden messages in time, mysterious warnings, the more time changes the more confusing things get.  Essentially you are a US soldier sent to an Island outside of Russia to investigate a radiation burst.  Next thing you know, time changed and things have gone to hell; you must embark on your quest to try and repair time.  Sound is really good.  The weapons sound crisp and clean, with the voice overs being decent.** This game lacks Subtitles,  which is a bit of a downer especially for the hearing-impaired or someone like me who just enjoys having em on **Graphics/Presentation: Graphics are very good, not ground breaking or jaw-dropping but they are crisp and do a good job setting a creepy environment.  I was actually more impressed with enemy animations.  Very realistic.  It was nice to shoot an enemy and it wasn't an insta-kill shot , you can see them on the floor trying to crawl away or get back up. I had a rare time where an enemy even faked it on me and shot me from behind.**Presentation is where this game honestly loses a star and why I am going into a little detail with it.  The game is short, but falls in line with the 'norm' these days it seems. On HARD I beat it in about 7hrs  which means on Easy  it probably is a 4-5hr play through.  Check points save your progress but once in a while they seem spaced fairly far apart.  While the puzzles and gameplay were lots of fun, the game starts to rely heavily on the same puzzle but not to the point where it makes the game annoying.  As the game starts to approach the end it just feels squished together.  The pacing is off and I started to find myself rushing through areas simply to get to more action  --- In other words  the game probably could of used just a tiny bit more polishing towards the last hour of gameplayLength/Replay: As said above, the game is about 4-5hrs on easy,  7ish on Hard.  3 different endings  make for good replay value however, if you simply select ""continue"" after you beat the game you can literally Re-beat the game and get a different ending thus taking away the replay value of the campaign(I still will play through it again though, try to find stuff I missed)  The game has Multi-player included but it really doesn't hold up well compared to other MP shooter gamesOverall Score: 83%Singularity is a fun game.  Worth a $60 purchase, ehhh probably not.  However $30 would be a great deal for the game.  It has a very polished shooting element with a decent storyline.  The game is a lot of fun and it is nice to be able to use the power of TIME itself to influence your enemies and environment.  What really held this game back was a lack of polish to the pacing and constant recycling of the same puzzle element; plus a very generic, almost pointless tacked on MP(that has almost the same number of achievements/trophies than the game itself?!)  Still, Singularity is definitely worth adding to your collection.  It is one of those games that you can return to after a few months and have just as much fun as when you first got it** Seeker Rifle should be mandatory for all future FPS games ****Bonus: The included Graphic Novel.  Honestly, don't pay extra just to get the novel.  The novel itself is well put together and uses color images but really doesn't add much to the game.  It essentially details the discovering of E99 in 1940.  Really serves no purpose since the discovery of E99 isn't a shocking revelation as the game tells you this 10minutes in."
3644795,B000WHUOEI,Not sure if it works- gave me headaches,"I am not sure how effective this product is for the cats, I have heard great things from friends. I plugged it in and after about 3 hours of it being plugged in, I had a severe headache. I get headaches frequently, so I did not necessarily associate it with the diffuser at first. I noticed that the headache went away the next day about a half hour after I left the house and then came back almost immediately when I came home. I decided to try unplugging the diffuser, just to see if it helped. After about two hours, my headache faded. After having a nice night of headache-free sleep, I tried plugging it in again to see if my headache would come back and I sat close to the diffuser so the whole apartment would not fill up. The headache came back, faster this time. I have tried a few times to plug in the diffuser sporadically, convincing myself the headaches were a coincidence. Every time I have gotten a headache. I looked up to see if anyone else has this reaction- apparently it is an uncommon reaction to the ethanol medium that the hormone is in when aerosolized. I wanted to write this review so that if anyone else gets the headaches, like me, they know they aren't the only ones! It took me forever to find evidence that other people had a similar reaction."

1724487,B000ETWQ4U,Out of square in an unexpected spot,"I almost left a very lengthy review about why I gave this combination square 2 stars when so many other people gave it 5 stars. There are people that leave very lengthy reviews that are actually EXTREMELY helpful to me when I am making a purchase. I opted to not go into all that detail for this.I would have given this square 1 star but the rule was actually very square to the head. The issue was with the rule itself. The top of the rule was 6 inches in length as it was supposed to be. The bottom of the rule was 5 and 15/16"" in length as it was NOT supposed to be. Each end of the bottom of the rule was 1/32"" shorter than it should be, making it not square at each end. This difference in length creates all sorts of issues as anyone that knows anything about combination squares would know. This should have been the simple thing to get right in the manufacturing process. I really wanted this square to be worthy of 5 stars because it was made in the USA and because it was reasonably priced.If you are looking for a reasonably priced square that is very close to being square, this is it. If you are looking for a reasonably priced square that you can use to make measurement marks at the end of the rule, this is NOT it. I purchased the E250 12"" rule, had the same problem, and left the same review for it.I have contacted Empire by email to tell them about this issue and am currently awaiting their response."

1726087,B000FNR726,Bad quality,"The AA battery section is either too tight or too small, I have many AA's. If you pushed them all the way in in the slots that were too tight, they would get stuck in there, so I had to just lightly let them stand in which looks ridiculous, others were too loose and they just easily dropped in, which isn't a problem but just shows the plastic forming process is poor. The battery tester is garbage as it is very hard to keep the battery still and you can't clamp down on it like you might think from how it looks in the picture, it keeps quickly slipping away."
24069,B003ZBZ64Q,It works... mostly,"For the price this isn't bad.  I thought it would work like the others, where the device uses the battery pack before its own internal battery, but this is not the case.  This battery pack is just good for charging and not when your ipad or whatever is in use.  I had issues with mine turning on.  Sometimes I cannot get it to turn on without first plugging it into an AC adapter to jump start it.  This is when it is fully charged too.  I don't know what is up with that.  I may end up returning it if the problem persists."
1860477,B000069HKH,A master storyteller at the top of his game,"It's really a shame that The Rising -- Bruce Springsteen's first studio album since 1995's The Ghost Of Tom Joad, and his first with the great E Street Band band since 1984's Born In The U.S.A -- has been pegged as a ""9/11 album,"" because it's so much more than that.  In the past, Bruce has vivdly portrayed such characters as the ""Highway Patrolman"" who can't turn in his criminal brother, the young working-class couple in ""The River,"" the angry Vietnam veteran in ""Born in the U.S.A.,"" and the AIDS patient in ""Streets of Philadelphia.""  On The Rising, he does the same for grieving survivors (""Empty Sky,"" ""You're Missing,"" ""Countin' on a Miracle,"" ""My City of Ruins""), rescue workers (""Into the Fire,"" ""Nothing Man""), a casualty (""The Rising""), even a suicide bomber (the poetic ""Paradise"").  But will these mostly September 11th-inspired tracks hold up?  Yes, and for three good reasons:1)  Springsteen's lyrics are mature enough to avoid kick-butt jingoism, but they're detailed enough to stir real emotion and avoid becoming too sentimental.  For example, the suddenly widowed narrator of ""You're Missing"" says, ""The evening falls, I got too much room in my bed, too many phone calls, 'How's everything?'"", while the one in ""Empty Sky"" offers, ""I woke up this morning, I could barely breathe, just an empty impression in the bed where you used to be;""2)  subject matter aside, the album is NOT a relentless bummer.  Words such as ""faith,"" ""strength,"" ""hope,"" ""love,"" and ""rise"" appear far more frequently than the motifs of ""blood,"" ""fire,"" and ""rain.""  Also, many tracks offer words of hope and optimism, such as ""This storm'll blow through ... this too shall pass"" (""Lonesome Day"") and ""Everything'll be okay ... Don't worry, we're gonna find a way"" (""Waitin' on a Sunny Day"");3)  like U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind and Elvis Costello's When I Was Cruel, The Rising is musically a return to form without slavishly imitating past sounds (the sole exception being ""Mary's Place,"" a throwback to such early Springsteen classics as ""Thunder Road"" and ""Rosalita"").  Also, Bruce's tunes -- whether joyously upbeat (""Lonesome Day"") or achingly pretty (""Nothing Man"") -- are as catchy as ever, and the E Street Band provide solid backing.  I must also mention such nice touches as strings (on many of the tracks) and a Pakistani choir (on ""Worlds Apart"").Bruce Springsteen is a master storyteller at the top of his game here, and he and his band have crafted a pure rock 'n' roll album of real substance.  Born in the U.S.A. and 1982's Nebraska are still my favorite Springsteen albums, but I believe The Rising is nearly as good as they are."

She draws, paints, makes 'things' every time she has the opportunity and the S Pen stylus and the software that supports it plus the ability to access media and play it on the Note's large screen are exactly what she dreamed for 'on the road' creativity support.The Note II may not be for everyone but for anyone who doesn't mind a 'giant' phone (or you can view it as a small tablet that makes phone calls) I can't think of anything better today. Of course, innovation never stops so I'm sure there will be better alternatives in a few months or in a year, or two."

1339067,B00007LVJD,If all RTS games were like this!,"Well, basically, C&C; Generals, has to be the best RTS game out in the market. Ive been anticipating its release for a while, and now that it's out, im not dissapointed at all. Generals is based on issues and global conflict our world today. You have the option of playing as China, USA, or an underground organization, known as the GLA(Global Liberation Army), each with its own distinct capabilities and missions.The graphics are simply awe-inspiring. Almost every other move you make, is followed by a very neat video-clip. Trails left by cruise missiles and F22 Raptors is stunning. Buildings and houses and civilians are very life-like, similar to Sim City4.You get to fight in Urban areas, deserts and many other locales.The gameplay is very similar to other RTS games. If youve played Real War and Real War: Rogue states, then C&C; Generals is nothing new, besides the improved graphics.

3749407,B000M8R0QM,Comp06 Pro Slime tire compressor/inflater,"I was deceived by some of the positive reviews of this product.  Yes, it is heavy and ""feels"" substantial (which some other reviewers believed were indices of quality); however, in my opinion, this product's features really SUCK!  Here is why:1.  The compressor hose detaches off the body of the compressor via a quick connect you push together and pull out to disconnect.  The one I received was defective.  I pushed it in one time, then pulled it out.  When I tried to connect it again, the danged thing wouldn't connect in with a snap.  This is unreliable.  How would you like to be stranded with a flat and think, ""ok, I just got to air up the spare and be on my way,"" only to find out you can't connect the stupid hose to the compressor.  Hoses that are permanently connected are better.  I've had cheaper models I've kept in my car and used for 20 years and there's never been a problem of the hose that was permanently connected, failing.  This detachalbe hose on the SLIME is worthless.2.  I also completely disagree with other reviewers about the screw on connection to the tire valve.  I prefer the snap down clamp type.  It's so much easier to just snap the valve on rather than screw it on to the tire valve.  Plus, your tire valve is dirty, so after you spend a few seconds screwing it on, most likely, you hands will be black.  I've had plastic snap down clamps on my other compressors and there's never been any failure or breakage of the plastic.3.  An the frickin bag that comes with it is too danged small.  Good luck trying to fit all the parts back into the bag!If you want convenience and reliability when it counts, don't get this compressor.  A big PITA!"
3635878,B000MD57OO,Great for my 3lb pomeranian,"I bought these stairs for my 3lb/4 month old Pomeranian puppy. I bought them based off the ratings and the dimensions, since this one was taller than the others on Amazon. The stairs are very sturdy, and the height is perfect for getting up on the leather couch AND Ikea bed. Without training, my puppy knew to use the stairs to go up and down the stairs, and does not attempt to jump down. Now I can have peace of mind she won't get hurt (my other pom broke his leg at 5 months/3.5 lbs jumping off the same bed).The only thing that could be changed is to make wider steps (closer to square steps rather than extremely rectangular steps). When she's super excited to run down, she kind of tumbles down because the steps don't leave enough room for her to leap down. Regardless, they are wonderful and I do not regret the purchase."

1303357,B007BY2F7O,Another gimmick for guitars!,"Installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser. I had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me. The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good. But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings. You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison. So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse. They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised. If anything they feel worse than regular strings. Last but not least: they are bad for frets. Just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick. I don't know about anyone else but I don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.For the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear."

That Said this album isnt that good, the only decent rapper in dipset is juelz Santana and hes not even THAT good.  That being said camron doesnt really rap he has like a fast talking/mumbling voice which is monotone and not exciting to listen to.  Also, he makes up words like your too cool to use the 900,000 plus words that are in the dictionary.

Just skip the rest of the tracks as you program your cd player and you've got a McCartney masterpiece."
1242711,B00GTCECVG,I Didn't Like It,"I'm a big fan of Clash of Clans, so I decided to try this one.  My assumption was that Castle Clash would be similar enough to Clash of Clans for me to enjoy it but different enough that it would not be dull.  Unfortunately, I could not get into this game.  The game play was a bit convoluted to me, the troop options too much to have to decipher, and the whole look too cluttered.Now am I say the game stinks and no one should try it?No.  I am saying it wasn't for me. You should download it, give it a try, and make up your own mind.  Perhaps it will be your thing, and if that is the case, play on brother."

2348932,630537841X,WCW Halloween Havoc on itself,"I just got done watching this event and it was probably one of the worst pay-per-views WCW had back in 1998.  It was one of those shows that you watch and when your close to the end, but not there, you're like ""end all ready! end!""  I'll give you some of the matches:Raven vs Jericho=good matchup.  No problems hereDisco Inferno vs Juventud Gurrerra= good match, but you can kind of tell Disco was having some problems with Juventud's movesDisco Inferno vs Kidman for cruserweight title=good matchRic Steiner/Buff Bagwell vs Scott Steiner/Giant=this match was ok.  I don't care for Buff Bagwell or Scott Steiner but I like the Giant and Ric Steiner.  They did the best moves in the match.Ric Steiner vs Scott Steiner=ok, nothing spectacularKevin Nash vs Scott Hall=pretty good match, lot of power movesSting vs Bret Hart=was an ok match, but kind of disappointing since the 2 had wayyy better matches against each otherHogan vs Ultimate Warrior=boring match, probably one of the worst matches on a WCW pay-per-view.  The show got boring during this one.main event: Goldberg vs DDP=it was a lot better than the Hogan vs Warrior match, but Goldberg winning was pretty predictable as always.  As you can tell, I pretty much hate Goldberg.  He couldn't put on a 30 minute match if his life depended on it.Overall, it was an ok show until about main event time.  Would I recommend this?  Yes because I'm a wrestling fan of WCW, but I would buy a different WCW show if you want some better matches"

But the lyrics and the music itself points to a hope beyond the darkness, although certainly one of Cockburn's intentions is, Brecht-like, to create enough angst in us to not forget that there is a world rife with....well, what shall we call it? Terror?  Sin?  Bad Guys?  beyond our speakers. Bruce is a superb musician and his voice is haunting.  A jewel among the Cockburn collection."

496892,B00A8SLH8I,Excellent Weight Checking Device,"I purchased this scale after having another electronic scale that gave out when I left the batteries in too long and they leaked.  I like this scale much better for a couple of reasons:  There is a method to calibrate the scale when you get it which is bound to increase its accuracy.  Secondly, one doesn't have to jar it for it to turn on, but can simply step on it and it is ready to give a reading.  The scale appears to be sturdy and it is easy to read the weight."
2498082,B00005JM23,"""That looks like a perfectly healthy green dog!"" - 4.5 stars","There are dozens of Don't Do Drugs flicks that feel like after-school specials, with their sluggish morals and predictable endings. Well, I can say that the ending of this movie was predictable, but the build-up to it, the acting and the finesse with which the special effects were implemented (voices going in and out of focus, characters in fast forward, teeth grinding) had me SPUN from beginning to end.Though Brittany Murphy gets most of the cover, the story is really about Ross (Jason Schwartzmann), a part of a screwed-up extended family that are all hooked on methamphetamines, including secondhand dealer Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), spaced-out game geek Frisbee (Patrick Fugit), and others. When Ross meets Nikki (Murphy), he gets hooked up to the real deal: a man that calls himself the Cook, who wears boots with spurs and a cowboy hat and spits, fights, and tweaks like a man. The movie, for the most part, follows Ross's exploits as he becomes the Cook's errand boy, ferrying Nikki around in exploits like taking her dog to the vet (who has turned green from too much inhalation), and otherwise taking the Cook out to score, buy beer and porn, etc.The best part about this movie is the dead-on behavior of the junkies. They hug and kiss you, they reassure you with pretty lies, they make you feel right at home - but the second they're short on drugs, or you say the wrong thing to them, they scream and throw things around. The next day you're friends again until the next fight, which is never very far off. And though you are led to believe through the whole movie that the Cook is the head cheese, it is interesting (and accurate) to discover that he is reporting to someone even bigger. And yuck, is the personal hygiene right on the nose for these characters - their teeth are gritty, their clothes dirty and raggedy, and through the few days we follow them it doesn't appear that any one of them ever takes a shower. All they want - no, need - is their next fix.The part that sold me from the beginning was the words that came onscreen as the film started up:BASED ON TRUTHAND LIES."
3298893,B004L03B3S,Not in English,I had no clue that the movie wasn't in English that's why I gave it 1 star I never seen it would have liked to know it was subtitled would have saved me money
407240,B003XKDIU8,Terrible . . . Very disappointed,"Everyone has a different story to tell. These glasses arrived in the correct strength but there is a scum on the lenses of all three pairs that will not come off with anything. Could have been a decent deal, but for the cloudy lenses. Quality is average to poor, frames are not comfortable for long wearing. Lining of case comes out every time you pull the glasses but could be glued in easily enough. Lenses also pop out if not careful when trying to clean them, and the ends of the bows are sharp and you have to be real careful putting them on so you do not scratch your scalp."
2100198,6300214605,Savini's Final Chapter,"Tom Savini was given the shot to do the makeup effects forPart 1, and made it (by many opinion) the best in the series. Thinking this would be the end of Jason and they wanted to do something different with the series they wanted Jason dead...really dead. And who better to bring him home than Savini, who sculpted the head of what we know Jason to be today.This movie has its moments of cheese, no doubt. Seeing Corey Feldman in the best acting job in his life (except forStand By Meand seeing the dude fromBack to the Future, round out the stars in this movie. And the plotline is nothing short of boring.But the kills are what we came here for. And they don't let us down. From getting your head twisted off, a spear through your chest, a cleaver in your face, and an axe to the chest, Jason shows us how much he truely enjoys killing. And we love watching it! Be honest, thats the only reason we keep going to these movies!!Savini's job at the ending was great, paid off. There's no way Jason was getting up after that. But alas there have been 7 more since (6 if you don't countPart 5).As with Part 5, this movie is important in the series. If you look at the series as a whole, you can see that this is where the human Jason dies; in the later films we see the supernatural Jason who pops up out of nowhere, runs incredibly fast while barely moving, and takes an enourmous amount of abuse before ""dying.""Rumors abound that they are rereleasing all the friday films in special editions. Already we see parts 1-3, with the others to follow shortly after. As a fan I'm sure to buy them, sucker that I am. This is a great series of movies to distract me from the problems of everyday life, even if only for a little while. Thank you Jason!"

1273603,B00IEOC4OO,An OK game that contains Flurry Analytics and collects your Phone ID and it has multiple fake 5 star reviews!,"This app contains Flurry Analytics which can collect your behavioral game play and what you do in the app. Combine that with the ability to collect your device ID and you now have an effective tracing device to link your device ID to your game play.  The app is developed with Adobe Air and it includes Facebook software integration.  The game also has links to Facebook and twitter.  The game is written in C/C++ using Android NDK.The game does not collect your location or phone list of calls.  The only critical permissions on the app are the ones I have listed below.  I rate the game as a 2 star app.  I wish that it did not have Flurry Analytics or read your phone ID.  There are also multiple fake 5 star reviews from obvious first time reviewers or reviewers that only posted reviews on the same day just to review this game.  I hate fake reviews and for that I deducted one star.The game starts with Brad the barbarian waking up hearing someone yell.  Rather than running to recue someone he brushes his teeth, pops a zit and pees.  Yes that is how the game starts.  You fashion a weapon out of a battle axe and make a lute.  You protect your town by using the lute to summon helpers to fight for you and fight the goblins for example.  You have a few powers but don't get killed by getting shot by the enemy.  Your powers can stun the enemy and increase the fighting power of your help.The game is OK as mostly you just run around trying to avoid the enemy's weapons that are shot at you, trying to collect their gold and notes that they give up when they die.  Meanwhile they are trying to attack the town and you have to run to defend it.  The graphics are good but the game is very repetitive.The game does have several permissions:* Read your phone state and identity* Modify and delete contents of your SD card (Read and write)* Full network access"
1640580,B004R8J8E0,Very tasty!,"I have only praise for this product.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 for it does not come with a bag.  It is called SHAKE N BAKE but there is no bag to shake it in!  Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.  Highly recommended.  Very easy and quick to use providing a delicious way to cook your pork."

2386478,B00000FELL,Fascinating journey brings history to life,"In this combination travel guide and history lesson, Michael Wood takes a 20,000 mile journey retracing the steps of the great conqueror Alexander the Great. One of the things that makes this so interesting is that the lands Wood passes through are just as dangerous now as they were in Alexander's time. The video came out in 1998; in the West, we may think of that as a safer time, but many of the places on this map have been in a state of war almost throughout recorded history. Afghanistan, for example, was in the middle of a civil war and Wood was warned by a guide that their lives were in danger as they passed through rugged mountains. In addition to war, of course, nature itself poses a threat in the form of mountain-slides, harsh deserts and extremes of temperature.As for Alexander, though we know many of the facts of his journey and the many lands he conquered, many things remain disputed. Wood mentions ancient historians such as Arrian, who themselves were writing long after the actual events. It is fascinating how legends of Alexander persist in this part of the world, from Iran to India, passed down not in books but orally from one generation to the next. For the people in these regions, many who live lives not very different from their ancestors in Alexander's day, more than 2000 years ago, history is not abstract but a part of daily life. In the video, for example, we see Iranian storytellers dramatically recounting events of Alexander's time. The diverse sights, scenery and people of these regions alone make the video worth watching.Alexander appears to have been driven initially by a desire for revenge against the Persian empire, which had long been an enemy of the Macedonians. As other reviewers have pointed out, Wood unfortunately uses Greek and Macedonian interchangeably, which is not accurate. When Alexander came to power, in fact, the Greek states such as Athens were hostile to him and saw him as a threat. This is such an obvious mistake, you'd think someone would have edited it out, but overall it's a minor quibble.At times Wood seems overcome with hero worship of Alexander, which makes him an enthusiastic if somewhat biased narrator. He does not shirk, however, from recounting some of Alexander's atrocities. Alexander appears to have been a complex and volatile individual who could be generous and magnanimous and at other times vicious and vindictive. Yet he was always a great leader and military commander (if at times lucky) who inspired his army to the most difficult tasks. Michael Wood and his crew follow some of the Macedonian army's difficult treks up mountains and through deserts, but at other times they are transported by jeeps and trains. We can imagine the difficulty encountered by Alexander's army --thousands of people making these journeys entirely on foot or horseback.Alexander the Great is one of the pivotal figures of ancient history. His campaigns helped break down the barriers dividing East and West. In The Footsteps of Alexander the Great is not a comprehensive or perfect account of Alexander's life, but it is probably the most exciting telling of the story you will find short of retracing the journey yourself."

1568167,B000SATUWG,More caramel than licorice,"I like Gustaf's other licorice, the ones I've posted a review on before.  But these, they are way more caramel-y than they are licorice-y.  You know the caramels (Brach's?) that you can buy in a bag and melt after you've unwrapped each piece to make caramel apples?  These are like those.  They have a grainy, very sugary texture.  Although the licorice flavor is okay, it's clear that this ""licorice"" is just caramel in disguise.  They seem way more geared to the American palate than to the European taste. (there's no ""zout"" to these at all.) These Gustaf's licorice caramels are a poor substitute for European ""caramel"" (toffee).  I won't be buying these again.For a better choice or replacement for the famed Callard & Browser licorice that you might remember, try Walker's NonSuch toffee.  It's awesome, and I wish Amazon currently had it available.  Once you try Walker's licorice toffee, nothing else will do."

I don't care what anyone says and I'm like, 33-it's a darling movie.I've never been a Holmes' fan, but she is just so likeable and pretty in this-very natural and I thought appropriate in terms of playing someone just get getting her bearings. She gets to wear some sweet duds in this movie ala formal dresses.The little father-daughter connection between her and Michael Keaton was also sweet-I wanted to call my dad and tell him I loved him after watching it. What was up with the Mom though? She seemed kinda off and she gave a look to Katie's love interest at the ball that was a little drunk and pervy I think.I also thought the chemistry between her and the James guy was great-they would make really cute kids. Tell them to hook it up and grace the world with some uber pretty children. And the best part is the chemistry is like, PG rated, so you don't have the cover the kids' eyes at all-all you get is a couple kisses and a pretty mild shimi-shimi dance from Katie in hot pants during her not-so ""wild""acting out moment.All in all, a very sweet movie with a really asthetically pleasing cast(think of walking clearasil and noxema and whitestrip advertisments all melded into one-or uh, like several-body/bodies)- and don't miss seeing Amerie as Katie's roomie-she's a really great singer-in her movie debut. She's a natural and not just your typical singer wannabe crossover actress who can't act!"
1786495,B0043WVTNI,I was an idiot: I bought this expensive faucet that is leaking in less than 6 monts,"The electric value in this close to $1,000 faucet is already leaking.Trust all the negative reviews; this is a rip off product. Why? The claim it has a warranty, but it only covers the parts. ---YOU--- have to spend the $100's of dollars to have a plumber repair the failed parts, which cost a buck or two.Enjoy spending you weekend repairing a brand new sink? Buy this item, or spend a few hundred dollars and a weekend waiting for the plumber to show."
3566080,B00GO5I0HU,no as good as SPL or Flashpoint,the movie starts out really good. Donnie Yen versus a ton of gang members.Donnie is in his element. KAPOW SLAM BOOM! AWESOME.....then the movie gets a love interest ladycop flirting & lots of car chases.She gets way too much camera time & the car chases are nothing special.The main villain  doesn't have any type of personality. seems dull.The music horrible. some weird rock for action scenes. didn't fit.Hope Donnie's next movies are more like SPL & Flashpoint & Ip Man in quality.

1404529,B0012N94WO,Nothing amazing and nothing  new,"The more I see games from the far east - the more I agree with Hideo Kojima, when he said ""If you honestly compare Japanese games with Western ones, Japan has lost"". Resident Evil is another example of how you can make a games, which looks great graphically, but is barely playable in terms of controls.To begin with, just to start the game you have to push the following sequence of buttons (or, more like ""push the same button so many times""): Start, X, X , X, X, X, Down, Down, X, X... Are you freaking kidding me???And it's the same throughout the game: every time you need to go to a next Act, or to restart a game because you got killed, it's a miriad of X pushes. Even to upgrade a weapon you have to push X to select the upgrade, then confirm Upgrade by pushing X again, then confirm the confirmation by pushing X again, then when it's upgraded you have to push X yet again to the message that the upgrade has been installed. HOLY COW!!! Who in the hell did come up with this stupidity???Now, I don't know why it was even considered as an option, let alone the ONLY option available, to completely STOP a player in his/her place to shoot and even to reload a gun. But it does seem like every playable character in the game is a complete idiot, unable to handle more than one task at a time: you can either move, or you can shoot, or you can reload your gun, but never the combination of moving and one of the other two.Aiming is also weird: while you're rooted in place, you have to find where in the hell the laser line ends, which is nearly impossible without a full (stereo) 3D, because you can't really tell how far it ends, because it can be pretty much anywhere on the screen (not centered as in the majority of games where you have to aim).The control scheme is the worst of all games in the world. I've complained on bad controls in other games, of course, but nothing comes close to RE5 in this regard: I doubt you can come up with the worst controls for decades to come.As far as the storyline is concerned - it's japanese, so it's all ridiculously cheesy and convoluted, just like pretty much all other japanese games that managed to reach the West. I know some people might like it, so take this as my personal opinion :)All in all, the controls completely ruined the game for me. The graphics are amazing (although the PS3 version, as usual, have gotten a shorter end of a stick, with jaggies appearing/disappearing all the time because of the ""dynamic"" antialiasing, framerate drops, which also causes control lagginess, and many other graphical compromises here and there that have already been mentioned by the [...] reviewers."
1343547,B00009U146,Not much new...,"I'd like to say that this was a good game, but it's hard to do.First of all, I use component cables for my TV/Xbox and ran into tiles that didn't quite meet on a lot of levels.  With how well the first game was put together, this came as a shock.  The game was also disturbingly easy even on the Hard setting.  It only took me 9 hours to beat on Hard without using any of the loopholes that are in the game.The other disappointments would have to be story itself.  Where you actually had some movement in the fist game, this game is stuck in one place and when I hit the 7 hour mark in the game I had thought I was only about a 1/3 of the way through.  My bad!Also, they recycled almost all of the textures from the other game.  As another review on a different website said, the water effects that were so stunning in the first game now look old and dated.I guess I just expected a little more from a company that put out Knights of the Old Republic and the BG computer series and the original DA."
1708593,B0001ZI560,Very Short Life and Too Expensive,"I own a lot of 18V DeWalt batteries(NICd) and tools (about 7 drills, 3 or 4 reciprocating saws, rotary laser level, 3 cordless nail guns, etc.). Most of them are dead. Some of them are less than 2 years. All of DeWalt 18V batteries discharge very quickly by themselves without using (less than a week after fully charged). I understand none of rechargeable batteries last forever and there is a life span. But comparing to other brands, DeWalt batteries are the most expensive and last less. Last year I bought a 18v combo set (drill, circular saw & flash light w/2 batteries) of Porter Cable at Lowes. I think it was less than $100.00. It has been a year. I don't take this one to the job site because all of my cordless tools are DeWalt. It has been in the garage for more than a year. I have not recharged battery yet after fully charged on the date of purchase. I have been using it occasionally, but it is still very powerful almost same as the fully charged on the first day. It is very hard for me to change other brands of cordless because I already have  too many 18v DeWalt. I agree with most of negative reviews. Before I place this review, I have thought a lot whether I am wrong or I expect too much. However, DeWalt batteries are too expensive and don't last long comparing to other brands. I use these tools almost every day as a professional carpenter. Early this year I bought a combo set of Lithium 18V DeWalt, drill & impact. It is still working good same as new one. I wish to buy another DeWalt 18v lithium battery only, but too expensive. It is better to buy a full set with batteries.I wish there are some generic brands of these batteries or DeWalt makes its price lower."
